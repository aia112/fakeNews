['Analysis John Harwood'],How Trump's presidency has played for Russia,"But you don't need James Bond to recognize the fact that more than any other modern American president, Trump has delivered some of what the Kremlin values most.

The issue has returned to center stage over the last month as intelligence officials update Congress on Russia's stance toward this year's campaign. Different intelligence briefers have offered alternative assessments of whether Russia favors Trump for the presidency, as it did in his 2016 battle against Hillary Clinton.

Trump and his aides insist a 2020 bias toward him wouldn't make sense anyway. ""We've been very tough on Russia,"" national security adviser Robert O'Brien told a television interviewer last month.

In some specific ways, the administration has indeed been ""tough."" Trump has imposed new sanctions against Russian misbehavior, though reluctantly and under congressional pressure.

His Pentagon sent two aircraft carrier strike groups into the Mediterranean Sea last year to deter Russian aggression. Trump gave Ukraine lethal aid in its war with Russia.

""If you look at administration policy, it's not all that bad,"" said Steven Pifer, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine, of the Trump administration's Russia policy.

Yet those steps represent the smaller part of the story.

The larger part is how Trump has advanced what some experts say are Russian President Vladimir Putin's higher-level objectives: dividing the United States internally, eroding solidarity with European allies, reducing the projection of American power abroad and thereby enhancing the 21st century influence of a diminished Russian state.

Trump, who privately sought a Moscow real estate project as a 2016 candidate, frames his presidential strategy as ""America First."" It envisions friendlier relations with Russia as helpful in resolving thorny foreign policy problems while he secures more favorable economic terms from longtime allies.

But Russia policy specialists see important benefits for Moscow.

After winning in 2016, Trump disdained the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia intervened on his behalf. That buttressed Moscow's attempt to disavow culpability.

Trump has assailed not just Democratic adversaries but also nonpartisan institutions such as the judiciary and the Federal Reserve, eroding public confidence in the American system itself. He has attacked executive branch officials serving under him as a hostile ""deep state."" The lagging federal response to the coronavirus highlights the consequences of his governance.

Pressed by one interviewer in 2017 on his expression of respect for Russia's president, Trump defended Putin by yielding the moral high ground on which his predecessors staked the claim of American exceptionalism.

""You think our country's so innocent?"" he asked.

Steve Hall oversaw US intelligence in countries of the former Soviet Union before retiring from the CIA in 2015 and is a CNN national security analyst. He says Putin wants a weakened US and Trump ""is currently the person on the political horizon who does the best job of that for him.""

Trump sapped Western unity by slapping trade tariffs on allies in the name of ""national security."" He became the first US President in the 70-year history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to cast doubt on America's commitment to defend member states from outside attacks by Russia or other adversaries.

Trump discusses security commitments in commercial terms, suggesting they remain contingent on financial concessions from allies. Uncertainty about the protective US umbrella rattles allies to Moscow's benefit.

""Every time the President says, 'Gee, they haven't paid 2% and maybe we won't support them,' Putin thinks that's good,"" Pifer said. ""You measure power in relative terms. This is the advancement of Russian power.""

""If you give Putin the choice -- destroy NATO but live with Ukraine getting arms -- he'd take it,"" added Duke University scholar Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser to President George W. Bush. Trump's equivocation leaves his subordinates to reassure NATO of American resolve.

Trump's abrupt announcement of troop withdrawals from Syria last year alarmed even staunch Republican supporters. The decision, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned, ""would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime"" in Damascus.

And the President undercut his own signature ""tough-on-Russia"" initiative in the episode that led to his impeachment. He delayed military aid while pressuring a newly elected Ukrainian leader to announce investigations of what he called ""corruption.""

One sought negative information about potential Democratic election rival Joe Biden. Another concerned whether Ukraine rather than Russia actually intervened in the 2016 election -- a notion Trump's former National Security Council official Fiona Hill calls a Russian propaganda fiction.

Lately the 2020 landscape Moscow confronts has changed significantly.

Just two weeks ago, the front-runner to oppose Trump was Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-styled ""democratic socialist"" who shares Trump's skepticism about projecting American military power abroad.

Now, Biden's emergence presents an option more like that in 2016, pitting Trump's record against a more traditionally adversarial approach to US-Russia relations.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/69JHJ-ccCVY/index.html,CNN,World,True
['Paul Gittings'],Tokyo 2020 Olympics: Japanese PM Abe insists Games to go ahead as planned,"(CNN) Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe insisted Saturday that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer as planned despite growing fears about the viability of staging the Games amid the global coronavirus pandemic.

With a string of global sporting events being halted in a response to the crisis, Abe has moved to dampen speculation that the Games, due to take place from July 24 to August 9, could be postponed, or even canceled.

""We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned,"" Abe told the news conference in Tokyo, but added the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would have the final decision whether Tokyo 2020 takes place.

His comments came after Tokyo 2020 organizers announced that the Greek leg of the Olympic torch relay had been canceled, but also insisted the Games would go ahead on schedule.

['Luke Mcgee'],Coronavirus is Boris Johnson's worst nightmare,"London (CNN) The outbreak of the novel coronavirus is causing political misery for some of the most powerful people on earth. It has, however, left one world leader in a uniquely difficult position.

Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, is having to deal with this public health emergency at the same time a clock is ticking on the United Kingdom's next Brexit deadline: July 1. This pending deadline is far more significant than anything that has happened in the Brexit process to date.

The UK is currently in a transition period with the European Union, set to expire on December 31. The point of this transition was to maintain a standstill in relations between the EU and the UK after Brexit happened on January 31, so to avoid an economic cliff edge.

The two sides are currently negotiating their future relationship and hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before the end of the year. If they can't, then the UK leaves the transition period with no formal agreement on trade or any other strategic areas. The joint decision to scrap next week's round of talks will lead to fears that such an agreement cannot be done in time.Legally, the transition period can be extended, but it would have to be done before July 1 of this year. That's the point of no return.

Until the transition period ends, the UK is playing by EU rules and paying money for the privilege, but with no seat at the tables of power in Brussels. In other words, it is still essentially an EU member state, but with zero influence on EU policy.

JUST WATCHED Here's what you need to know about Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Here's what you need to know about Brexit 03:38

Naturally, this is an uncomfortable position for long-standing Brexiteers -- not least Johnson himself, who led the successful leave campaign in 2016. So, it's hardly surprising that the official position of the British government is that Johnson will not request an extension under any circumstances.

However, that stance was decided before the nation was gripped by coronavirus panic.

""However politically painful it might be for the government, the impact of the coronavirus will reach far beyond the public health implications and into the heart of our economy,"" says Wes Streeting, an opposition Labour lawmaker. ""In good times, leaving the EU on the timetable announced by the government would be a challenge. Trying to stick to that timetable purely for political reasons would be irresponsible.""

The UK is already living some of those implications. Panic-buying has led to shortages of many everyday household products, most notably toilet paper. And if you think empty shelves are a problem now, consider this: according to the Confederation of Paper Industries, the UK imports about 60% of the materials used to make tissue products from the EU. And up to 55% of that demand is for toilet paper.

Some in Brussels wonder if a time will come when experts advising Johnson tell him that, given the scale of the coronavirus problem, refusing to extend the transition period and throwing trade links and supply chains out the window is a bad idea. And if trade talks with the EU slow because of coronavirus, meaning that nothing has been agreed come June, can Johnson really risk food, medicine and other shortages for the sake of saving face?

""Now that future relationship talks are being interrupted, it is inevitable that both sides will have to start considering possible extensions,"" says Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska at the Centre for European Reform, based in Brussels.

However, she adds: ""The request should come from the British government and, obviously, an extension wouldn't come without costs for the UK. Questions, including the financial contributions, will have to be taken. There is no such thing as a free lunch.""

While Brussels might already be thinking about this, the unknown is what Johnson would actually do if he were given the advice to request an extension. And European officials are increasingly convinced that Johnson is still in denial about how serious things could get.

An EU diplomatic source tells CNN: ""It doesn't seem to have sunk in entirely just how different supply chains will look after the transition. Right now, there are hangers full of food sat in ports across Europe. If someone calls at 7 a.m., they can be in British shops that afternoon. The UK imports the vast majority of its toilet paper, so if you kill supply chains you are literally in the s***.""

Two issues collide

Johnson has made a point during the coronavirus outbreak of stressing that the government is making decisions based on the advice it is getting from medical experts. It's certainly true that Johnson has placed his most senior public health officials front and center in recent weeks. Sources close to Downing Street claim that this approach is being driven by Dominic Cummings, Johnson's most senior adviser.

Cummings is known to be obsessed with scientists, data and evidence, so it stands to reason that he would ask government advisers not to brief and encourage the PM to take his cues from the experts. However, this is the same Dominic Cummings who is driving Johnson's Brexit agenda and is thought to have been behind the decision to say publicly that there would be no extension under any circumstances.

So, what will happen when these two distinct issues collide? There is no question that requesting an extension would be very difficult and embarrassing for Johnson. ""If he doesn't want an extension then it's fine, but if he wants one, they [The EU] will have him over a barrel on fishing and financial contributions,"" says Hugo Dixon, referring to two of the thorniest issues currently blighting negotiations. ""It's not just that he will have to go back on his word of no extension under no circumstances, he will have to bite those two bitter pills.""

Exactly how damaging requesting an extension could be for Johnson would have to be weighed against the fallout of no deal, or a very limited trade deal. ""It's entirely possible that the UK suffers a recession in the coming months because of coronavirus, only to then have another recession because of Brexit,"" says Dixon.

While back-to-back recessions would seem difficult for any leader to ride out, Brexit has done weird things to the UK's domestic politics. As the diplomatic source explains: ""Johnson has already laid the groundwork domestically to frame no deal as a fight against EU colonialism versus the UK being able to do what it wants.""

Dixon believes that this could be the easiest political option for Johnson. ""He could bite all the bullets at once and try to ride it out before 2024, when we are out the woods and he can fight an election.""

For the time being, no deal with Europe seems to be the logical endpoint. Dmitry Grozoubinski, founder of explaintrade.com, says that while the Covid-19 crisis could ""focus minds on the need to find a compromise,"" it could also ""rob the negotiations of all political attention, removing any pressure from politicians to back off their currently irreconcilable red lines and leading to a WTO-Brexit crashout largely on autopilot.""

It seems likely when you consider that the EU's patience for British politics wore thin ages ago. ""We are moving to the stage where we don't really care, whatever they do,"" says the diplomatic source.

And while the source believes that the coronavirus gives Johnson ""a way out if he does want to delay for a year,"" they point out that it ""has to come in June -- legally, that is the deadline.""

However, some hold onto the slim hope that the evidence becomes so compelling Johnson has to listen. Gostyńska-Jakubowska points out that when Johnson drew his red lines, ""we didn't have Covid-19. This might encourage the British government to listen to business more carefully."" And Dixon reminds us that Johnson has form for folding when the need for an agreement with Brussels is great: ""The EU won't have forgotten that he essentially gave them everything they wanted last October.""

Both Johnson and the EU are currently close to capacity dealing with the coronavirus crisis. And as the July 1 deadline races up on Johnson, he is likely going to face pressure to consider extending the Brexit transition to avoid economic catastrophe. ""Short-term political pain for Boris is a price worth paying when compared with the medium to long-term risks of getting something like this badly wrong,"" says Streeting.

The great unknown is whether Johnson -- and Cummings -- can be convinced that the risk of going beyond the point of return this summer is really bad enough to perform what would be a staggering U-turn. And though we might not know what they think now, we won't have to wait long to find out.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/iXILuoMKNZQ/index.html,CNN,World,True

"['Julia Horowitz', 'Cnn Business']",Here's what could really sink the global economy: $19 trillion in risky corporate debt,"London (CNN Business) Companies have spent the years since the global financial crisis binging on debt. Now, as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to push the world into recession , the bill could come due — exacerbating damage to the economy and feeding a meltdown in financial markets.

Looking to take advantage of low interest rates , companies have rushed in recent years to issue bonds whose proceeds could be used to grow their businesses. Corporate debt among non-banks exploded to $75 trillion at the end of 2019, up from $48 trillion at the end of 2009, according to the Institute of International Finance.

As the coronavirus spreads — touching off a plunge in oil prices and a collapse in travel, and shutting factories from Italy to China — there is increasing alarm that companies in the energy, hospitality and auto sectors won't be able tomake their bond payments. That could trigger a spree of ratings downgrades and defaults that would further destabilize financial markets and compound the economic shock.

""This certainly is another match being lit [near] the bonfire of corporate debt liabilities,"" said Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics. ""There's definitely potential for systemic risk.""

The coronavirus shock

Investors became increasingly anxious about corporate debt this week as stocks sold off and crude prices nosedived. The ability to buy or sell securities in corporate debt markets has become much more difficult. And the extra returns that investors are demanding to hold corporate debt over more stable government bonds have shot up, signaling that they're now viewed as much riskier holdings.

SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK Thedropped more than 6% this week, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF fell more than 8%. Bank of America told clients on Friday that volatility had skyrocketed and outflows from corporate bond funds were at record highs.

The anxiety is pegged to companies that rely on stable energy prices and tourism to generate cash. When business gets tougher for these firms, it could prevent them from servicing their debt, leading to defaults. Ratings agencies could also start downgrading many of these companies, forcing some bondholders to sell.

""Default and downgrade risks have increased to their highest levels since the start of the current business cycle,"" Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist at Goldman Sachs, told clients this week.

Much of the risk lies with energy companies, which have ramped up borrowing in recent years to build pipelines and fund other projects. Those companies now face acute pressure due to plummeting oil prices, which have dropped 50% since early January amid evaporating demand for fuel and the implosion of an alliance between major energy producers Saudi Arabia and Russia that had helped prevent oil from flooding onto global markets.

""Oil producers who were depending on the higher prices to pay back their loans so they could drill for oil are under a significant amount of stress,"" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a consultancy based in Houston.

Chesapeake Energy CHK Whiting Petroleum Corporation WLL Investors dumped shares this week in two US energy companies that Morgan Stanley said are at risk of default within the next year:and. Chesapeake's stock fell to 15 cents on Thursday, while Whiting shares closed at 75 cents.

Airlines, hotels and cruise lines are also in trouble as restrictions on movement grow and more people hunker down at home. A ban on travel from Europe to the United States, announced by the Trump administration on Wednesday, eviscerated airline shares. Budget carrier Norwegian Air, which is heavily indebted, said it would temporarily lay off up to half its workers after its stock dropped 22% on Thursday.

American Airlines AAL Alaska Air ALK ""Coronavirus' rapidly increasing effect on air travel is placing downward pressure on global airline credit profiles, especially as there are risks that demand takes materially longer than previous shocks to recover,"" Fitch Ratings said Thursday. It is monitoring, which has a significant amount of debt, as well as, which is based in Seattle, the site of a significant outbreak in the United States.

A flight arrival information board displays cancelled flights at an airport in Japan.

Automakers are under the microscope, too, as factories in Italy shut down, with more potential closures looming across Europe and in the United States as the number of infections rises in those areas. The industry was already in its third year of a sales recession because of falling demand for vehicles and the US-China trade war.

Who holds the debt?

With the risk of downgrades and defaults growing, the focus for investors then turns to who holds those liabilities, which could rapidly lose their value.

Banks are less exposed to risky corporate debt than they were to bad mortgages in 2008, according to Capital Economics' MacAdam. But that doesn't mean there isn't potential for a corporate debt crisis to reverberate through the financial system.

One issue is the growing number of corporate bonds that are rated BBB, at the very low end of the spectrum of what is considered ""investment grade"" debt. If those bonds get downgraded to high-yield or ""junk"" status, investment funds could be forced to dump them based on their mandates. That could further stress the market and cause liquidity to dry up.

In 2011, corporate bonds rated BBB made up about a third of the market, according to Capital Economics. Today, such bonds account for nearly half of it.

Lots of debt issued by energy companies fits that description. An estimated 67% of investment grade debt issued by energy companies is rated BBB, compared to 50% overall, according to Morgan Stanley. And $34 billion of BBB-rated energy debt is already on negative credit watch from one or more ratings agencies.

Plus, so-called ""shadow banks"" — or financial entities that face far less regulation than traditional lenders — have snapped up large amounts of corporate liabilities. A decade of persistently low interest rates has pushed down yields on safer government bonds, encouraging private equity firms, hedge funds and even pension funds to buy riskier assets with higher returns.

""As the economic cycle matures and investors have picked all the low-hanging fruit — the good, solid investments that give a solid return and aren't too risky — you're naturally going to be looking for riskier and riskier things that years ago you wouldn't have touched with a barge pole,"" MacAdam said.

Emre Tiftik, director of global policy initiatives at the Institute of International Finance, said it's difficult to determine just how vulnerable these players are.

""We really don't know that much about private equity and hedge fund exposure,"" he said.

Seeding systemic risk

In its most recent financial stability report, the International Monetary Fund raised the alarm about piles of risky corporate debt, which it said could amplify problems and deepen the next recession.

The group conducted a stress test based on a hypothetical economic shock that's half as severe as the 2008 global financial crisis. The results suggested that corporate debt worth $19 trillion from eight countries — China, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and Germany — is at risk of default in a future downturn of that magnitude because companies would struggle to generate enough cash to meet repayments. That would be 40% of all corporate debt.

A wave of defaults, or even a series of rating downgrades and repricing, would shake the financial system.

""The credit market is moving quickly towards the point of no return, where the turn in the credit cycle becomes inevitable and irreversible, as funding sources dry up, issuers face liquidity crunch, credit losses rise, investors rush for the exit, and face extremely thin liquidity on the way out,"" Oleg Melentyev, head of high-yield credit strategy at Bank of America, told clients Friday.

And while this is a standard end to a credit cycle, Melentyev said, it appears to be playing out at three to four times normal speed.

Should the situation deteriorate further, it will also have economic consequences as companies hurry to reduce their debt burdens, the IMF noted. There could be waves of layoffs, and business investment could fall off. Defaults would also hit banks and could lead to less lending. Companies could find it more difficult to borrow during the period when they need it the most.

This would exacerbate a global recession caused by the coronavirus, which a growing number of economists now warn is a real possibility.

The expectation is that if the world does tip into recession, it would be sharp but short, with the global economy bouncing back as soon as the threat of the virus recedes. But credit risk in the system incorporates a big question mark.

"['Kathryn Vasel', 'Cnn Business']",How to work from home without losing your sanity,"(CNN) Workers throughout the country are finding themselves working from a new office : their homes.

As coronavirus continues to spread throughout the country, companies are asking employees to work remotely to help control contagion.

At first, working from home might seem like a dream: no commute, no distracting co-workers and think of all those chores you'll be able to sneak in!

But after the novelty wears off, things get real. It can be lonely . Your home suddenly feels a lot smaller. And there's no real end to your work day.

""I think the biggest thing that is underestimated is the psychological impact of being alone,"" said David Hassell co-founder and CEO of 15Five, a performance management software provider, where 40% of the workers are remote.

Here are some tips to stay well-balanced:

Take a break

Let's be honest: You don't work eight hours straight in the office. There are coffee breaks, lunch walks and chats with co-workers that give some respite from work.

Just because you are working from home doesn't mean you aren't entitled to the same breathers.

""There is a tendency to work throughout the day to overcome some stigma that you aren't working when not in the office,"" said David Rabin, vice president of global commercial marketing at Lenovo.

Hitting the pause button throughout the work day can be a boon to productivity.

""It's not going to take anything from your effectiveness,"" said Julie Morgenstern, an organization and productivity consultant and author of ""Organizing from the Inside Out."" ""Stepping away for breaks are part of productivity; they actually make you smarter and give you perspective and answers.""

Get structured, but not too much

It will take a little time to get into your groove working from a different environment.

If you were the office worker who liked to bounce around from your desk to a conference room table to a private meeting room to get your work done, don't feel like you have to limit yourself to one spot in your house, advised Rabin.

But be thoughtful about where you choose to work and make sure to match the environment to the type of work you are doing, suggested Morgenstern. For instance, find a quiet area to work for some deep thinking, while sitting outside on your patio might work to respond to emails and other housekeeping-type tasks.

And make sure to designate some places as work-free zones.

""You should preserve some spaces in your home that you never do work in,"" she added. ""It is very hard to relax at night when you start to associate those spaces with work.""

Repurpose your commute

A major perk of working from home is ditching the commute. But that doesn't mean your work day can start earlier.

""Use your commute time in the morning for self-renewal or family time, not work,"" recommended Morgenstern.

Set very clear boundaries

""Working from home doesn't mean you are working more hours,"" warned Morgenstern. Be clear with your manager and coworkers of your schedule and stick to it.

And when your work day ends, put away your work equipment and change into your evening or lounge clothes to help signal the shift to personal time.

You also have to be clear with the other members of your household who might be wanting your attention during the workday. This could be particularly challenging if schools close.

""Create some structure to the day and designate play and work time while organizing space into work and play areas, recommended Morgenstern. ""You have to impose some order.""

Show your face

When possible, use video over the standard conference call to help create more interactions and avoid loneliness.

Three times a week all the employees at 15Five, whether they work from home or are in the office, get on a video call, for an all-hands meeting.

""We can see everyone's faces since everyone is on their own laptop with their own camera -- that is really important,"" said Hassell.

Force social collisions

Working from home means no popping into your colleague's office to chat or running into someone on your way to the bathroom and discussing weekend plans.

""When those drive-by connections are missing,"" said Morgenstern, ""If you are energized by being around other people, it can be despairing.""

But social interaction can still happen from home -- you just have to be more proactive. Set up regular check-ins with your team or manager that allows you to not only provide progress updates, but also sort through any problems or brainstorm ideas.

Use FaceTime, Zoom and other video tools during meetings or just to chat with coworkers to help avoid loneliness.

At 15Five, there are two Slack channels that provide a discussion space for workers.

One is more formal where people discuss what they are working on and other business-related subjects while the other one, called ""water-cooler,"" is more casual, where people post more personal messages and funny images.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/fHnZBEs2rZA/index.html,CNN,World,True
"['John Defterios', 'Cnn Business']",Why oil prices are crashing and what it means,"London (CNN Business) Oil prices have suffered their biggest fall since the day in 1991 when American forces launched air strikes on Iraqi troops following their invasion of Kuwait.

Monday's crash spooked markets that were already freaking out about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy and demand for oil. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, were down 22%, last trading at $35.45 per barrel. US oil is trading at $33.15 per barrel, a decline of nearly 20%.

Here are five things you need to know:

Why are oil prices crashing?

Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, launched a price war over the weekend. The move followed the implosion of an alliance between the OPEC cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia.

The kingdom and Russia came together to form the so-called OPEC+ alliance in 2016 after oil prices plunged to $30 a barrel. Since then, the two leading exporters have orchestrated supply cuts of 2.1 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia wanted to increase that number to 3.6 million barrels through 2020 to take account of weaker consumption.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin, worried about ceding too much ground to American oil producers, refused to go along with the plan and his energy minister, Alexander Novak on Friday signaled a fierce battle to come for market share when he said countries could produce as much as they please from April 1.

Why did Saudi launch a price war?

Simmering differences over how best to manage global oil markets spilled into the open at a meeting between OPEC and Russia in Vienna on Friday. After Russia said it was ditching the alliance, Saudi Arabia warned it would live to regret the decision, sources who attended the meeting told CNN Business.

The oil price war follows a rift between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, over how best to balance world energy markets.

Moscow had become tired of cutting production to stabilize prices and felt that the policy of supply restraint gave more room for US shale companies to grow. Mikhail Leontiev, a spokesperson for Russian state oil company Rosneft, described the OPEC+ deal as ""masochism.""

""By yielding our own markets, we remove cheap Arab and Russian oil to clear a place for expensive US shale oil and ensure the effectiveness of its production,"" he told Russian state media on Sunday.

America has become the number one oil producer in the world and is expected to pump about 13 million barrels a day in the first quarter of this year.

Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia decided to fight for greater market share by slashing the prices its preferred customers pay by between $4-$7 a barrel. The kingdom is also reportedly planning to lift production to over 10 million barrels a day.

What does coronavirus have to do with all of this?

The coronavirus has undermined energy demand worldwide, but especially in China, which is now the number one importer of crude oil, guzzling roughly 10 million barrels a day.

Factories have been idled and thousands of flights canceled around the world as the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, has become a global pandemic.

The International Energy Agency said Monday that it expects demand will contract this year for the first time since the recession in 2009 that followed the global financial crisis.

Which countries will be hurt the most?

A price war in the face of collapsing demand is not a recipe for oil stability.

It is difficult to see any winners: the major oil producing countries will lose money regardless of the market share they can claw back. Russia claims to be the most insulated to lower prices because its annual budget is based on an average price of roughly $40 a barrel. US sanctions have forced it to become more efficient.

The Gulf countries produce oil at the lowest cost — estimated at $2-$6 a barrel in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates — but due to high government spending and generous subsidies for citizens, they need a price in the range of $70 a barrel or higher to balance their budgets.

Oil dependent states that have suffered from years of conflict, uprisings or sanctions will pay the heaviest price. Iraq, Iran, Libya and Venezuela all belong in that category. But the United States won't escape either. The shale oil boom has brought with it an economic windfall for some states, and low prices will hurt oil companies.

Will it have an impact on consumers?

Big importing nations such as China, India and Germany could get some much needed relief from falling energy bills.

And consumers benefit in general from lower oil prices and the resulting decline in gas prices at the pump, especially in the United States where retail markets react more directly to supply and demand. Taxes and surcharges make up a higher share of pump prices in Europe, so the effect is less marked.

But any reduction in gas prices will likely be outweighed by the dislocation to the economy caused by the coronavirus led slowdown in global growth.

Then there's the impact this price war will have on US oil producers and energy jobs in states such as Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico and North Dakota, who have enjoyed a boom over the last decade.

"['Laura He', 'Cnn Business']",China boasts massive car and aviation markets. Both collapsed in February,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) China's automotive and aviation industries suffered historic drops in activity in February as the government locked down cities and restricted travel to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Car sales in China collapsed 79% compared to a year ago, according to data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Thursday. It was the biggest ever monthly decline, according to Reuters . Only 310,000 vehicles were sold.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include electric or plug-in hybrid cars, plummeted 75% to 12,908, even though the government has been pushing hard for the adoption of such cars.

The country's aviation regulator also released dire figures, saying that the industry recorded its worst financial performance ever in February. Passenger traffic plummeted 85% from a year earlier to 8.3 million people, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Cargo traffic decreased 21%.

Flights are still struggling. Only 40% of domestic flights had resumed by Sunday, according to the regulator.

"['Nell Lewis', 'Cnn Business']",How India's Silicon Valley is using tech to tackle traffic,"London (CNN) Imagine being stuck in traffic for 243 hours , equivalent to just over 10 days. Rush hour commuters in Bangalore, a city in southern India, spent around that time in traffic last year.

The city has the worst congestion in the world, according to the 2019 TomTom Traffic Index , overtaking Mumbai, which held the title for the previous two years.

Bangalore's rapid expansion as India's tech capital is partly responsible. The number of cars on the roads has rocketed from 1.4 million in 2000 to more than 8 million in 2019.

But tech could also provide the solution, as startups have sprung up to break the gridlock.

Take Bounce , a Bangalore-based scooter-hire company with a fleet of more than 17,000 electric and gasoline vehicles in its home city. Customers can rent a scooter via its app for as little as 14 rupees (19 cents) an hour.

Founded in 2014, Bounce now operates in more than 30 cities in India with both a docked and dockless model, where you can pick up or drop off the bike anywhere in the city. It claims more than 120,000 rides are taken on its scooters in Bangalore every day.

In January, the startup received a fresh $105 million in funding, taking its overall capital to more than $200 million, Varun Agni, its CTO and co-founder, tells CNN Business. This led to its latest public valuation of $500 million, he adds.

While the initial motivation behind Bounce was ""democratizing the commute"" and providing affordable access to mobility for all, one major byproduct has been a reduction in traffic, says Agni.

Four in 10 users start or end at a subway station, he says. ""This has a massive impact on reducing traffic and congestion,"" as it encourages people to use public transport rather than using a car for the whole trip, he adds.

It also has an impact on the environment, especially as the company introduces more electric scooters to its fleet; by the end of the year, at least half of its vehicles will be electric, says Agni.

Cutting cars and carbon emissions

Quick Ride , a carpooling company also founded in Bangalore, aims to create a sustainable commuting option while cutting the number of vehicles on the roads, reducing fuel consumption and minimizing CO2 emissions, the company tells CNN Business.

It estimates it has saved 90,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions since its founding in 2015, equivalent to that emitted by 19,000 passenger vehicles in one year.

Using its app, drivers connect with passengers on the same route and fill their empty car seats. Quick Ride's system allows them to share the cost of the journey using fixed per-kilometer charges and it manages the payments through user accounts, removing the need for cash exchanges.

It operates in nine cities across India with a total of 3.5 million users, almost a third of which are based in Bangalore. The company says it has raised a total of $15.5 million in funding.

Heavy traffic in Bangalore.

Capgemini CAPMF Companies including consulting firmhave partnered with Quick Ride to encourage employees to carpool, as part of their corporate sustainability strategy.

More than 70% of employees signed up to Capgemini's #CAReToShare campaign in 2019, and since the start of the program in 2017 they have clocked up more than 33 million kilometers in carpool journeys, the company says.

""This program was launched with the dual objective of making the daily commute for our employees more convenient, while trying to ease the pollution plaguing our cities,"" Vijay Chandramohan, senior director of India's corporate real estate services for Capgemini, tells CNN Business.

""Cities in India are growing at an exponential rate,"" he says. ""There is tremendous pressure on the city roads, leading to increasing traffic snarls and commute time resulting in frustration and loss of productivity.""

['Amy Chillag'],US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""

""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

"['Bill Weir', 'Cnn Climate Correspondent']",Rising seas are turning Miami's high ground into hot property,"Miami (CNN) In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location.""

In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.

And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.

While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.

Even now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.

""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""

The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.

In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are.

Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.

Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.

But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.

They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.

""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""

Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.

""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""

Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.

After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.

Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.

A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.

They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""

She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.

""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.

""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.""

He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.

But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""

A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.

""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""

Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.

""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.

But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.

And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/pbQjkbD_bFk/index.html,CNN,World,True
['Stephanie Bailey'],Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"(CNN) Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

Spend wisely

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.

""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.

Divestment

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.

Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""

Wealth means power

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.

""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.

""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.

Fund climate research

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.

In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.

""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

Role models

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.

""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.

""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.

""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/Pa_SMoc1110/index.html,CNN,World,True

Last season, Satoshi Kondo's first collection for Issey Miyake was a viral sensation. Replete with helicoptering dresses, skateboarders and floating models, it was hard not to see it as a joyful statement of his arrival as the label's new designer, replacing Yoshiyuki Miyamae after an eight-year stint.

""I was really surprised by the positive feedback and positive response on social media,"" said Satoshi Kondo during the dress rehearsal for his Autumn-Winter 2020/21 show, staged at the Lycée Carnot, a school in Paris. ""That was something I didn't expect at all. I was really thrilled because at the time the Issey Miyake brand didn't have an Instagram account.""

The question this February at Paris Fashion Week was, what would he do to follow that up?

""As a designer I feel like Issey Miyake has always been a brand that focuses on the joy of making, and I think I can bring, as I did last season, the joy that people feel when they really enjoy the clothes they wear,"" he said.

Since establishing the Miyake Design Studio in Tokyo, Issey Miyake has revolutionized what is considered luxury wear -- by pushing beyond Western silhouettes with the introducing of more drape, loose lines and pleating, and by showing that wearability and playfulness can be synonymous with innovation and glamour.

With a habit of promoting-up within the company -- Kondo-san had been at the label for 13 years already -- rather than introducing new leadership from outside, the house of Issey Miyake seems very much a tight-knit family -- albeit a highly creative, industrious one - working towards a common goal. And though he stepped back from daily design duties in 1999, Issey-san and Kondo-san speak regularly.

""There are times when I talk to Mr. Miyake every day, and there are times when I talk to him once or twice a week, but we have always been exchanging ideas""

""It is just casual conversation, but I get advice not only on clothes and design but more generally from Mr Miyake. This restaurant is really good, you should go see this movie, things like that.""

For his sophomore effort, Kondo-san reunited with choreographer Daniel Ezralow, his collaborator from last season, to create a stage show that was more subtle in execution, but still brimming with possibilities.

""It's a message as simple as that, but that's my attitude and my goal as a designer,"" Kondo-san said. ""Issey Miyake has always been a brand that's looking ahead, looking forward.

"['Francesca Street', 'Yann-Guillaume Jaccard', 'Ceo', 'Co-Founder Of Swiss Private Jet Company Simply Jet Sa']",Private jets are taking off because of coronavirus,"(CNN) — So your flight's canceled, but you need to get home or to that important business meeting ASAP. Perhaps you're just nervous about transiting through a busy airport with other passengers.

Most of us are handling coronavirus-related disruption by staying put, but for those in a travel predicament with dollars to burn, there's an increasingly popular alternative: private jets.

While much of the travel industry has been suffering as the infection spreads globally, the private jet industry has apparently been on a roll.

Alain Leboursier, director of sales at Swiss private jet broker Luna Jets, tells CNN Travel that there's been an ""impressive increase"" in bookings and enquiries from passengers in recent weeks, correlating with heightened concerns surrounding COVID-19.

In February, about 15% of overall requests were related to coronavirus, Leboursier says. That's now doubled to 30%.

""We got around 200 requests [on Sunday] Out of the 200 requests, 60 requests were coming from 'Coronavirus regions',"" adds Leboursier. ""Either people want to escape, or [there is] urgent business that needs to be done today or tomorrow.""

Clients include companies that normally book employees in biz class seats and high net worth individuals concerned about the spread of the virus.

On-demand private jet charter provider PrivateFly have noted an even bigger surge in demand since President Donald Trump announced restrictions on travel from the US to 26 European nations.

According to CEO Adam Twidell, the company are receiving a ""significant number of requests"" from Americans currently in Europe who are seeking to return to the US, as well as those keen to fly from Europe to the UK, which is exempt from the ban at present.

""Overall the inquiries we're getting are from people very concerned to get their families back together as soon as possible, given how rapidly the situation is developing,"" Twidell tells CNN.

""One client is flying her daughter home to the US from University in France, and several of her fellow students (who are also US citizens) are sharing the flight back with her.""

Leboursier says Luna Jet flew out a passenger over the weekend who usually divides her time between Rome and London. When Northern Italy announced unprecedented restrictions on Sunday, she chartered a flight to London right away. The following day, the lockdown was extended to cover the whole country.

Yann-Guillaume Jaccard, CEO and co-founder of Swiss private jet company Simply Jet SA, says he's currently inundated with inquiries regarding routes that have reduced commercial flights.

""Provided we find an aircraft and crew that is willing to do it [...] we do can do flights in and out of China with private jets,"" he says.

And it's not just European operators noticing an uptake. Jerod Davis, chief and managing pilot at US-based Southern Jet, says his aircraft are getting booked up far in advance.

Davis puts this down to a mix of ""common sense reasons and fear"" -- a lot of his clients are older, at higher risk of suffering ill effects if they contract coronavirus.

""They'd rather be on the plane by themselves, rather than with a crowd of people on airlines, and in security lines and all that,"" Davis tells CNN Travel.

US-based Paramount Business Jets echoes Davis. ""We are seeing anywhere from 100% to 300% increases in charter requests depending on the region worldwide,"" says CEO Richard Zaher.

""The requests are coming from private jet clients, government officials, entertainers and sports teams, corporate executives as well as people who normally would not fly private.""

New customers

Those travelers turning towards the private jet market do so for a range of reasons, with one common denominator: they're all able to spend thousands of dollars on the trip.

Operators say they're now servicing customers who would usually take business or first-class options.

""We are seeing a lot of requests from people who normally would not fly private,"" says Paramount Business Jets CEO Zaher.

Zaher gives the example of an older woman who was traveling from the east coast of the US to the west coast and discarded her commercial flight ticket in favor of a private jet.

Yann-Guillaume Jaccard, CEO and co-founder of Swiss private jet company Simply Jet SA “People basically are happy to pay a premium using our service versus commercial aviation to decrease the risk of contracting the virus.”

Another domestic US passenger was on oxygen and opted to travel private due to health concerns.

Twidell, of PrivateFly, says his company has also had requests from passengers keen to avoid exposure to crowded airport terminals or scores of passengers in airline cabins.

""These include a family looking to return home to Chicago, from New York where they have been attending a wedding,"" he says.

""The group includes an older passenger in their late 70s and a young child.

""Another group includes an immuno-compromised passenger, and they are returning home to the US from the Caribbean. In Europe, one flight was for a couple returning to Jersey in the Channel Islands, from Spain. They were keen to avoid making the necessary airline connection in London.""

Luna Jets, meanwhile, assisted a European passenger who canceled all his commercial tickets for the month of March, and decided to fly private instead. The Swiss company also operated several emergency flights out of Italy when the lockdown on the country's northern regions was announced Sunday.

""We're working on a flight for a company working on moving its 50 top employees from northern Italy back to London where they also have an office,"" says Leboursier.

Meanwhile, British private jet company Victor tells CNN Travel that a LA-based studio recently got in touch about arranging an emergency charter flight to transport 50 employees from Tokyo to LA.

Jaccard says some wealthy families from coronavirus ""hotspots"" have opted to relocate to another continent altogether, chartering private jets to up sticks from Europe to South America with the intention on ""staying there until the situation stabilizes.""

""That's a flight profile we don't see on a regular basis,"" says Jaccard. ""We were quite surprised to discover that some people are actually willing to just relocate themselves for an unknown period of time until you have more info and you know how it evolves.""

A cleaner aircraft?

Private jet users seek solace in the fact that the aircraft's exactly that -- private. There's no battling for arm rests or ending up in close proximity to others. Plus, these flights operate out of small, private aviation terminals, not mass transport hubs.

""It's quite likely that you will be alone when you board your aircraft, you will only have contact with the security agents and the crew, and some airport personnel,"" says Jaccard.

""People basically are happy to pay a premium using our service versus commercial aviation to decrease the risk of contracting the virus.""

Fears aside, medical experts assure CNN Travel that passengers are unlikely to catch coronavirus on board a commercial airplane.

""Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, told CNN Travel last week , reiterating that hand washing is the best prevention.

""You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth,""

Still, for travelers concerned about hygiene -- the idea that private jet companies likely spend longer cleaning their aircraft is comforting.

Private jet companies also say that, like their commercial counterparts, they've stepped up the sanitization process.

""We always clean the airplane, it's a private jet so we always have it looking nice, but did we sanitize every single surface on the airplane before? Let's be honest, no. But now we do,"" says Davis.

Jaccard says Simply Jet SA has evaluated the cleaning products used -- and opted for ""medical grade"" options.

While private jet companies might be more willing to fly in and out of lockdown zones, the aircraft still operate within the same framework, rules and regulations as commercial airplanes.

Flying into a lockdown zone involves a safety assessment and submitting a flight plan to airport authorities, who will send it to health authorities, who pass on a list of requirements.

Air crew are given a full briefing on the route they're flying, the level of risk and the government stance on the destination.

Leboursier says Luna Jets ensures crew maintain good health by adopting a ""no overnights"" policy in lockdown regions and ensuring crew stay on board throughout their time on the ground.

PrivateFly's Twidell says crew members are having their temperatures checked before every flight.

Long-term impact

While private jet companies might be reaping the benefits of an unexpected boom, Davis says he can't help but have a ""weird feeling"" about getting more business because of a global health crisis.

""Obviously we don't want this to continue,"" he says. ""What we hope is this minimizes and goes away pretty quickly.""

Still, Davis acknowledges a long-term benefit could be that individuals who've opted for private jet travel during the crisis will be hooked, and continue to charter jets in the future.

""Once you fly private, you don't really want to go back,"" he says.

British company Victor points out that while there have been ""new requests for evacuation"", there have also been ""cancellations from those avoiding all travel.""

""It's too soon to know to what extent business aviation will be affected,"" says a Victor spokesperson.

The other players express fears that this short-term boom might simply be shielding long-term implications -- after all, if commercial air travel grounds to a halt, so too will private jet travel.

Plus, there's the economic consequences of a potential market downturn

""If everything is down 25% in a couple of months, that means that our clients may have to get rid of some personnel, they might need to close some factories, or they're just going to experience a general decrease in demand for their products over a long period of time,"" says Jaccard.

Luna Jets' Leboursier expresses similar concerns.

""In the long term, to be honest we are petrified -- because as the leader in Europe, if the market goes down, then we will be the most affected,"" he says.

Jaccard, of Simply Jet SA, says his company is also concerned about the future.

""We are always optimistic short term -- of course we are here to try and help where we can to provide alternate travel solutions that can replace all these routes that are not doable anymore,"" he says.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/5nK0QBSgEos/index.html,CNN,World,True
['Tamara Hardingham-Gill'],Tourists being kept under coronavirus quarantine at luxury Maldives resort,"(CNN) — While there's no doubt that having your vacation interrupted by a fast-spreading virus that's infected more than 108,000 globally and killed over 3,800 is a major inconvenience, there are surely worse places to be confined than a luxury Maldives resort.

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

['Silvia Marchetti'],Why the last man standing on the coronavirus cruise ship never gave up,"(CNN) — His ship may have been to hell and back, becoming a floating coronavirus-infected prison for passengers quarantined at port in Japan, but when the captain of the Diamond Princess cruise ship became the last person aboard to finally step onto dry land, he looked entirely unruffled by the experience.

If it weren't for the mask on his face, Gennaro Arma, striding purposefully along the dockside in full uniform with hat under arm, might easily have been stepping down from an uneventful trip shuttling passengers from one vacation destination to another.

But those who know him best say the steadfast calm Arma exhibited throughout the ordeal in which more than 700 people on board the ship tested positive for COVID-19 was typical.

It's why, they say, the experienced Italian sailor is now being hailed as a hero at home and abroad.

""He emerged to be exactly how people have renamed him -- 'Fearless',"" Arma's wife, Mariana Gargiulo, tells CNN Travel from her home in Sant'Agnello, a beautiful coastal town south of Naples, where the captain is due to return soon.

""He never had any problems, and I never worried because we were constantly in contact.""

The quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess has been widely criticized for intensifying the risk of infection for those stuck aboard. Many passengers were eventually airlifted out, but not before at least five people had contracted fatal infections.

Nevertheless, Arma apparently proved himself a tireless rock for his passengers and crew during their ordeal and he's been widely praised for helping lift spirits and for setting a noble example of how a captain should deal with adversity.

'My gladiators'

His support for his crew was on display right to the end when he disembarked on March 2, having overseen the final transfer of all passengers either to hospital or a quarantine facility.

He called them ""my gladiators.""

Throughout the quarantine, he also regularly thanked all passengers on board for their patience and perseverance, leaving them notes of encouragement.

Back in Sant'Agnello his friends, family, townsfolk and local authorities are waiting for Arma's return, preparing to throw him a huge homecoming party. The captain tested negative for the virus and is currently in quarantine in Japan.

His wife says the captain's calm and control during the emergency made it easier for passengers to endure being confined to their cabins. It also gave his family a sense of peace and reassurance.

""We talked each day, both by phone and video chat,"" she says. ""I could hear he was calm, that everything was fine, and I could see that he was fine. He never had any problems.

""I could see him on the ship, he was doing well, working. We had the chance to talk a bit about everything, even our family, and not just about the situation on board.""

Arma, according to Gargiulo, is a real sea dog with decades of expertise that led him to travel around the world after he graduated at a prestigious local maritime school.

""He is a man with great sea skills and know-how,"" she adds. ""His main worry has always been the well-being of his passengers. It was a good test.""

As the wife of a cruise liner captain, Gargiulo has come to share and support her husband's job. She says she's ""always been very serene"" even during the past critical weeks.

""After many years, I'm used by now to the fact that he can be away, and far away, for a long period of time.""

Gargiulo says she doesn't know what Arma's next plans will be -- whether he'll take a break or not before heading back to sea. For now, she says she's just focused on seeing him again.

'A true diamond'

His employer, Princess Cruises, has already expressed its gratitude for its captain's efforts.

""Throughout the response efforts on Diamond Princess, Captain Arma was an exceptionally calm, capable, and inspirational leader for everyone on board,"" Princess Cruises president Jan Swartz said in a statement to CNN.

""From his regular daily shipboard updates to his tireless coordination with public health authorities, Princess shoreside operations, and his on-board team, Captain Arma's contributions have been hailed worldwide as a case study in outstanding leadership best practices.

""As he said to his self-proclaimed 'gladiators' onboard -- a diamond is a piece of coal that did really well under pressure, and I believe Captain Arma himself is a true diamond.""

Passengers too have praised Arma's steady leadership and the comfort he showed them through regular messages, updates and even gifts.

""Thank you to [Captain] Gennaro for his announcements and ability to find humor in an unusual circumstance,"" wrote one guest , Au Na Tan, on Twitter.

She added that Arma was ""courageous, sympathetic and carried himself with dignity and optimism for what was an unprecedented and unique situation. Through the entire journey, he sought to bring light to our circumstances and strove to reassure us as much as he could,"" because it's true that only ""a frightened captain makes a frightened crew .""

Arma's wife says his warm and friendly approach to guests is one of his many winning traits and part of his character.

'Symbol of Italy'

""He always takes good care of passengers, he's always had a particular attention for them,"" she says. ""Each day at lunchtime, before they'd start to eat, he wishes them all 'buon appetito' in Italian.

""And then there was the gesture of handing out flowers and chocolates on St. Valentine's Day to passengers shut in their cabins,"" to make them feel better and let them know they've not been abandoned, she says. ""It must have been really hard for them.""

Passengers were thankful for the Valentine gifts and food, posting photos online of what Arma's crew provided them with.

At one point, Arma recited a quote from the Bible to guests on the power of love, taken from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians, to lift spirits and send out a message of faith and resilience.

It's not just those who endured the drama on board who have praised the captain.

His actions have resonated worldwide, especially in Italy where many people have seen him as embodying Italian endurance and the spirit of sacrifice. They've turned to social media to express gratitude and feelings in phrases such as "" proud to be Italian . Grazie!""

Another admirer says he should be ""a mandatory case history for talkative, braggart and cowardly politicians.""

""There are captains and captains,"" reads another post that says Arma's actions would be worthy of inclusion in writer Rudyard Kipling's novel ""Captains Courageous.""

Local Sorrento and Amalfi coast newsrooms have also been flooded with messages from Arma's new fans.

One of them wrote how the captain's efforts make him worthy of ""the same sea waters roamed by Odysseus, Aeneas, Christopher Columbus"" and other great seafarers and mythological heroes.

Matching heroism with humility, Arma's final message to his crew stressed that it was teamwork that pulled them all through.

['Patrick Gillespie'],Mexico ready to retaliate by hurting American corn farmers,"Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn.

Mexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today. And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States.

It's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country.

""I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina,"" Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City.

He added: It's a ""good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes.""

American corn goes into a lot of the country's food. In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere.

Related: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us

America is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn. American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada.

American farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data. In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million.

Experts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers.

""If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy,"" says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm.

Rios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats. Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%.

Trump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA. He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true.

Related: Mexico doubles down on Trump 'contingency plan'

Still, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like.

All sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period.

But Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA.

Such tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter. He's not alone. Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond ""immediately"" to any tariffs from Trump.

""It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,"" Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show.

Apple has joined an industry group devoted to wireless charging, strengthening existing rumors that the next iPhone will charge without a cord. The Wireless Power Consortium, which is made up of some 200 organizations that promote a single wireless charging standard, confirmed to CNNTech that Apple joined the group last week.

IPhone rumors swirl months before each new version is announced, and hype around the so-called 'iPhone 8"" is particularly high: Apple (AAPL) is expected to unveil a major redesign of the this fall to mark the 10-year anniversary of the smartphone.

The company has already shown interest in doing away with cumbersome cords. The Apple Watch charges wirelessly, provided consumers spend $79 on a magnetic charging dock. And the latest MacBook now comes with only one USB port.

"['Rishi Iyengar', 'Kristie Lu Stout']",How 'America First' could turn into 'India First',"America is great because of its willingness to accept talented immigrants.

That's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity.

""If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent,"" Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.

Infosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas. The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs.

The Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform.

Curbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest.

India is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry. According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians.

Shares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown.

Nilekani said it would be a mistake for the administration to follow through.

""Indian companies have done a great deal to help U.S. companies become more competitive, and I think that should continue,"" Nilekani said. ""If you look at the Silicon Valley ... most of the companies have an immigrant founder.""

India's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized. The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India.

Related: India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas

But Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's ""America First"" plan. If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India.

""This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season,"" he said. ""It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here.""

Nilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example.

The Bangalore-born entrepreneur left Infosys in 2009 to run India's massive social security program, which is known as Aadhaar. As a result of the initiative, the vast majority of India's 1.3 billion citizens now have a biometric ID number that allows them to receive government services, execute bank transactions and even make biometric payments.

""It was built by extremely talented and committed Indians,"" Nilekani said. ""Many of them had global experience, but they brought that talent and experience to solve India's problems.""

['Alanna Petroff'],Swiss voters reject corporate tax overhaul,"Voters in Switzerland have shocked the political establishment by rejecting a reform plan that would have brought the country's corporate tax system in line with international norms.

The tax reforms, which were widely supported by the business community, would have removed a set of special low-tax privileges that had encouraged many multinational companies to set up shop in Switzerland.

Experts say the future of Switzerland's tax system is now unclear. The vote result could create headaches for firms that had been banking on their implementation, and deter companies who had been considering a move to the country.

""They do not know what [tax] measures will be available... That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions,"" Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement.

Switzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system. The country runs the risk of being ""blacklisted"" by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019.

Many voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland. That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class.

The current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations. International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies.

Martin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms. The measures were rejected by 59% of voters.

""I think it's a very bad day for Switzerland,"" Naville said. ""Clearly, the uncertainty and the credibility in the Swiss [system] has taken a massive hit.""

['Paul R. La Monica'],Stocks hit record again. But is Trump the reason?,"The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 each hit new all-time highs Monday.

Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will continue to thrive.

So is this the Donald Trump rally? Or the Janet Yellen rally?

Some strategists believe Trump's stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring.

Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead?

You could argue that POTUS 44 has dealt POTUS 45 a pretty good hand.

The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident.

But investors (and financial journalists) are often quick to give the president more credit -- and blame -- than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market.

RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday, one that was aptly titled ""Message to Market: It's Not All About Donald.""

Related: Trump isn't killing the bull market

Golub noted that the S&P 500 rose nearly 7% from late June through Election Day -- a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president.

But stocks have continued to rally since then, rising another 8% since Trump pulled off the upset (at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street) victory.

You can't have it both ways. It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didn't lose.

Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won, a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress.

Yet Golub points out that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was going up during the late summer as well.

Of course, many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too.

Yet once again, many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected, but was happening because many thought he would lose.

Related: Stocks have avoided a 1% dive for an unusually long period of time

So it's odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win.

What's really going on? The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve.

Yes. the markets are reacting to Washington. But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen, not the White House.

The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in 2017 regardless of who won the race for president.

The good news for investors is that the U.S. economy seems to be growing steadily, but does not appear to be at risk of overheating.

Related: Here's why the world's largest money manager is worried

The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of 2.5% annually. But that's not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates.

Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year, they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time. That would push the Fed's key short-term rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%.

That's still extremely low. At those levels, stocks would still be more attractive than bonds. Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip. And consumers would probably keep spending.

So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president,

With that in mind, Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. And what she says about the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes could wind up keeping the rally going full steam ahead -- or stopping it dead in its tracks.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/WuHmoPyNDKc/index.html,CNN,International Market,True
['Seth Fiegerman'],Apple stock nears record high,"Apple has found its groove again.

The iPhone maker's stock hit $133.82 in early trading Monday, putting Apple less than $1 away from its intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015. Apple's stock ended the day at $133.29, beating its previous record closing price of $133, set in February 2015.

The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL) to a $700 billion market cap, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of ""major new features"" like ""3D sensing"" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney.

Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the ""mother of all upgrades.""

Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year. The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014.

The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand.

Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration'

Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters.

Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits.

But that losing streak just ended.

Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.

The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record. At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes.

Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, ""Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped.""

The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple. There's also President Trump.

Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts.

Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts. If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/TPXuj8i67Q4/index.html,CNN,International Market,True
['Patrick Gillespie'],"America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico","America and Canada have one of the world's biggest trade relationships.

President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada,"" Trump said at the news conference.

But the U.S.-Canada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think. There have been trade wars, acts of retaliation, allegations of dumping and jobs lost.

""Our trading relationship obviously is strong...but the relationship has been rocky, despite the agreements we have in place,"" says Stuart Trew, an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa, Canada's capital.

Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA, the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. But Canada is rarely mentioned.

Yet, there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada -- almost all by U.S. companies -- than against Mexico. Even today, Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat.

Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive. But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way.

Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau.

1. Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico

Listening to Trump, you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA. But since NAFTA's inception in 1994, there have been 39 complaints brought against Canada, almost all by U.S. companies. Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements, it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico, Canada, or the U.S.

There's only been 23 complaints against Mexico. (By comparison, companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of 21 complaints against the U.S.)

And increasingly, Canada is the target of American complaints. Since 2005, Canada has been hit with 70% of the NAFTA dispute claims, according to CCPA, a Canadian research firm.

2. The U.S. - Canada lumber battle

NAFTA isn't the only sore area. In 2002, the U.S. slapped a roughly 30% tariff on Canadian lumber, alleging that Canada was ""dumping"" its wood on the U.S. market. Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies 30,000 jobs.

""It was a very sour point in Canadian - American relations for quite a while,"" says Tom Velk, an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The dispute had its origins in the 1980s, when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts weren't playing fair.

Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute.

Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada. American lumber companies still allege that it does, and a U.S. Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in 2004. It didn't say whether the subsidies were ongoing.

According to the allegations, Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from. That subsidy -- on top of Canada's huge lumber supply -- allowed Canada to price its lumber below what U.S. companies can charge.

The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada, denying America's claim and the two sides came to an agreement in 2006 to end the tariff.

However, that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October, and the two sides are back at it again. The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldn't reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with U.S. lumber companies calling once again for tariffs.

3. Smoot-Hawley triggers U.S. - Canada trade war

Things got even worse during the Great Depression. In 1930, Congress wanted to protect U.S. jobs from global trade. So the U.S. slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers.

It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act. Today, it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was.

Canada was furious, and retaliated more than any other country against the U.S., sparking a trade war.

""Canada was so incensed that...they raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new U.S. tariff,"" according to Doug Irwin, a Dartmouth Professor and author of ""Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.""

For example, the U.S. increased a tariff on eggs from 8 cents to 10 cents (these are 1930s prices, after all). Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from 3 cents to 10 cents -- a threefold increase.

Exports dwindled sharply: in 1929, the U.S. exported nearly 920,000 eggs to Canada. Three years later, it only shipped about 14,000 eggs, according to Irwin.

Related: Remember Smoot-Hawley: America's last major trade war

4. Canada's sky high tariffs on U.S. eggs, poultry, milk

Fast forward to today. Smoot-Hawley is long gone, but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on U.S. imports of eggs, chicken and milk.

For instance, some tariffs on eggs are as high as 238% per dozen, according to Canada's Agriculture Department. Some milk imports, depending on the fat content, are as high as 292%.

""They're so onerous that you can't bring it across. There's no American eggs in Quebec,"" says Velk.

According to Canada's Embassy in the U.S., reality is much different. Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs, Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk, poultry and eggs.

The U.S. does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries, but they are not nearly as high as Canada's.

Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some U.S. dairy and poultry farmers, some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market. But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now.

Related: Those Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about

5. COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA

Despite all these disputes, experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world.

In fact, the two countries are so interconnected now, when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against U.S. lawmakers.

For example, Canadian meat producers disputed a U.S. law that required them to label where the cattle was born, raised and slaughtered. Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the U.S. and took the case to the WTO.

The WTO sided with Canada, and last December, Congress repealed the country-of-origin-labeling law. American meat producers -- whose business is intertwined with Canada -- actually supported their counterparts in Canada, arguing the regulation was too burdensome.

As for Trump's proposal of tearing up NAFTA, many American and Canadian experts say that it's not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement. The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth.

['Paul R. La Monica'],"Verizon's new plan: Consumers win, investors lose","Verizon has brought back its unlimited data plan. That's great if you're a Verizon customer. But it is terrible news for its investors.

Verizon (VZ) stock fell nearly 1.5% in early trading Monday. It's now down about 10% so far this year, making it the Dow's worst performer of 2017.

Verizon's move is a clear sign the company has to pull out all the stops to remain competitive with wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS).

""In recent months, both T-Mobile and Sprint had some success taking additional share from Verizon by virtue of their unlimited offerings,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report Monday morning.

That may explain why shares of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is now controlled by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, are both up this year while Verizon is down. T-Mobile and Sprint have also been perennially linked as possible merger partners.

But the new telecom price war isn't the only problem for Verizon.

AT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms. Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service.

Related: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans

And AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX). Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings.

But the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years.

Yahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year. It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter.

However, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it ""continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches"" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon.

Verizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous. In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications. And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX).

There also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR).

That may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now. But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days.

Anything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible.

Related: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover

Still, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%. And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends.

Companies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected. Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt.

That's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too. That could push bond yields even higher.

So Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year.

That's why Verizon, nicknamed Big Red because of its logo's crimson hue, may see its stock in the red for the foreseeable future.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/EU3QwX3lIos/index.html,CNN,International Market,True
['Ivana Kottasova'],Oil prices have doubled in a year. Here's why,"It's a good day for OPEC.

Data published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production.

The confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016.

The price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions.

Since then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel.

Here's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher:

OPEC deal

OPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices.

The news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%.

Investors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply.

Crucially, the deal has stuck. The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production. The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%.

UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected.

The production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months.

Related: OPEC has pulled off one of its 'deepest' production cuts

Investors upbeat

The OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it. The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC.

The widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases.

Higher demand

The latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year.

Demand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016.

The IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017.

Saudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale

What's next?

Despite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher.

That's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market. The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes. That's 152 more than a year ago.

U.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report.

""This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output,"" said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index.

Uber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers. The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia.

In India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival. Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities.

Ola also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015.

Universal Biopack makes packaging that it sells to restaurants and manufacturers. But rather than plastic, it uses a mixture of bamboo and cassava, crops that are widely found across the country.

After growing rapidly in recent decades, Thailand has become one of Asia's biggest economies. But like many other countries in the region, it's been slow to try to combat the millions of tons of trash produced each year.

""Waste management is a big problem everywhere,"" said Universal Biopack's managing director, Vara-Anong Vichakyothin.

The company is using a technology devised at a Bangkok university to make its zero-waste packaging. It hopes it will eventually replace many of the Styrofoam boxes and plastic bags that end up in huge garbage dumps across Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.

Its eco-friendly formula took five years to develop and is so adaptable it could end up being used to package things like furniture and even phones. The bamboo it uses comes from leftover scraps from the chopstick manufacturing process.

In the cities of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, where takeout drink containers and noodle packets line the sidewalks, the company supplies restaurants, organic farmers and other businesses in the food and drink industry.

But finding new clients can be tricky.

Takeout food vendors in Thailand want to keep costs down in a competitive business with thin margins. Asking them to spend more on packaging for environmental reasons is a tough sell.

""The local economy still does not support [this technology]"" said Universal Biopack's founder, Suthep Vichakyothin.

But that hasn't stopping other companies from entering the sustainable packaging market in Thailand. Like Universal Biopack, they're betting on growing environmental awareness eventually leading to an increase in demand.

To become more competitive, Suthep's company is investing. It's aiming to ramp up production by building a partially automated assembly line at its factory near Bangkok and doubling its staffing from 50 people to 100.

The goal is to increase monthly capacity from 300,000 units to one million.

['Aj Willingham'],Here's how to outsmart fake news in your Facebook feed,"(CNN) Just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true . It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn't have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn't breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit.

It doesn't have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot -- if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.

NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars , an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis , the head of theat the Poynter Institute.

This one is tough, because satire doesn't pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate.

The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information -- which may or may not live up to what was promised.

A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda.

These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren't supported by the information in the article.

These are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real.

First, know the different types of misleading and false news

""People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,"" she told CNN. ""I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn't necessarily mean you're internet savvy.""

Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren't immune to fake content.

""If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we'd go a good way towards combating flasehoods,"" he told CNN.

Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it's important to have a ""healthy amount of skepticism"" and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news.

For starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:

1. Does the story come from a strange URL?

Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like "".co"" or "".su,"" or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales.

2. Does the headline match the information in the article?

Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don't bother to click through.

Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. ""Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to 'Take Their Business Elsewhere',"" trumpeted one such headline.

However, the articles themselves didn't contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi's stock saw a significant drop (it didn't). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump's election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to ""take their business elsewhere.""

3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?

Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney.

A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump's election win. The story quickly caught fire online -- after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry.

It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio -- in 2015 . It had nothing to do with the election results at all.

4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?

Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. ""IT BEGINS,"" read the headline.

However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the ""bathroom bill"" was to be passed.

In fact, according to Snopes , the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy.

5. Does the article cite primary sources?

It's not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral.

One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a ""clear parasite"" was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel

Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found -- because the story is 100% fake.

6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?

A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:

""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""

quote is nowhere to be found in them. This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it : People.com has extensive archives, and thisin them.

7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story?

During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as ""reported"" by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as ""reported"" by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!

In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It's always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop -- or if they all lead back to the same dubious site -- you have reason to doubt.

8. Is your own bias getting in the way?

Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook's algorithm -- the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.

Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence.

""We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,"" says Zimdars. ""If we come into contact with information we don't agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.""

So if you find an outrageous article that feels ""too good to be true,"" use caution: It just might be.

9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization?

you're getting the real deal. View the whole list here. Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know

10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites?

things can get tricky. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. This is where. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars' now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list

While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as ""fake"" is not accurate. ""I want to make sure this list doesn't do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,"" she says. ""It's interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/g8ESQjzCp_Y/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

['Sarah Sekula'],Flying a sports car with wings,"Tampa, Florida (CNN) — When it comes to piloting a plane, I have zero experience.

In fact, I've never even considered attempting it.

Nevertheless, as we swoop over Florida's Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.

At 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it's known as a sea light-sport aircraft.

Designed to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there's nothing else quite like it on the market.

Now that I'm in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I'm not entirely sure.

However, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car.

Plus, the fact that Icon's CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn't hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.

So far, so good.

We glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I'm comfortable enough to take in the sights. Lovely Fort De Soto Park doesn't disappoint.

l e v a r t

Squiggles of dreamy white dunes are surrounded by water that looks like it should be in the Caribbean.

The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, with its series of long-spanning cables, is equally impressive.

The adrenaline is still racing. And as most surreal experiences go, it just keeps getting better.

For starters, there's another ICON A5 to my left, which is thrilling in itself. We are flying in formation, and my job is to mimic its movements. You'd think this would be intimidating, but it's not.

It's just plain fun.

That's music to Hawkins' ears. He's the brains behind this newfangled plane, an idea 10 years in the making.

As a former Air Force F-16 pilot and a Stanford Business School grad, he has focused most of his adult life on making sport flying available to the masses.

""The idea for us was to create an airplane where the average human being can go out and experience the world without having the burden of becoming a professional pilot,"" he says.

So it makes sense that the dashboard looks like what you see in your car. There are only a few gauges that I don't recognize.

""It's the Apple approach to things,"" he says. ""You humanize it, and make it intuitive and easy and cool.""

He's so confident people will want to fly (and buy) his planes that he just opened a flight-training facility at Peter O. Knight Airport.

Located on Davis Island, five minutes from downtown Tampa, it's a place where both beauty and sailboats abound.

The company's other training center is in Vacaville, California, where ICON is headquartered.

Wide eyes and open windows

By 9 a.m., it's time for a brief water-landing pitstop.

Hawkins takes over the controls. I've been too busy learning to fly in formation (not something non-pilots get to try very often) and interviewing Hawkins to even think about learning to do a water landing myself. It's something Hawkins tells me most people can master in about 30 minutes.

A few negative-Gs and 360-degree turns later and it becomes a fun roller-coaster ride in the sky. Plus, it's an open-air flight, so I occasionally flop my arms out. Just because I can.

At a few hundred feet above the water, it's easy to spot a boater waving at us, a flock of pelicans and even stingrays.

""We're gonna pull over here and stop and get out for a second,"" he says.

Surely he's kidding, right? But after landing the plane on the water, he takes off his seatbelt, and I realize he's not.

Seconds later, he pops the roof and we climb onto the wings, which could easily double as diving boards. Suddenly, this feels less like a plane outing and more like I'm on a boat sunbathing.

Everything is drenched in a mesmerizing golden hue. I can imagine picnicking on the beach nearby. Or taking the plane somewhere for a remote weekend camping trip.

Because the plane has a range of about 430 miles on a full tank, it's made for short getaways.

""This entire thing is about inspiring people,"" he explains. ""Once you learn to fly, you will never be the same. You will look at the sky different, you will look at the planet different.""

Designed to make flying simple

""The primary motor skills for operating a plane are pretty easy,"" Hawkins tells me. ""We have people landing by themselves with an instructor on their very first day, within 30 minutes.""

That said, they've painstakingly taken the time to design it for safety. The goal of the spin-resistant airframe feature is that if the pilot makes mistakes, the airplane doesn't lose control.

As a backup, there's a complete airplane parachute.

""The spin resistance feature is a big deal as it's the first airplane that the FAA has deemed spin-resistant,"" says Chris Dupin, a flight instructor and US Air Force officer. ""A significant number of general aviation fatalities are from loss of control accidents that involve an unrecovered spin on the base to final turn.""

Plus, there's the angle of attack indicator, something you don't typically see in a light aircraft. It shows you where the wing is happy (in the green) or where it could stall (in the red).

The pilot's job is to keep the wing within the green or yellow section of the gauge. This is part of what makes water takeoffs and landings so easy to learn.

Becoming a barnstormer

""Kirk Hawkins has an extremely creative and innovative idea for pilot training that is more intuitive; teaching the feel of flight first and the principals and structure later, not unlike how people learn to drive,"" says Christine Negroni, veteran aviation journalist and author of ""The Crash Detectives.""

""The world is facing a pilot shortage, so the idea of teaching differently, so that different learning styles can be accommodated could very well expand the pool of pilot candidates.""

On that note, about 40% of the folks who've put down deposits for the ICON A5 are not pilots, which means this plane is drawing aviation newbies.

After an hour and a half of flying time, Hawkins lands us on the airport runway, a maneuver that you can tackle after you've mastered several water landings. It's a bit trickier since it requires more precision and knowledge about crosswinds.

At this point, if I owned this plane, I'd hook it up to a trailer, fold the wings up, drive it home, and park it in the garage.

Get some air time

If you want your own ICON A5, get in line. More than 1,800 customers have put deposits down.

For those who aren't ready to shell out $207,000 to buy one, there's the option of stopping by ICON's training facility in Tampa, or the facility in Vacaville, California, to fly for the day.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/TmUmdkaEi9k/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

['Ashley Strickland'],Going to space is a real pain in the back,"(CNN) A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study .

Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission.

Things don't improve when they return to Earth's gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc.

""It's sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,"" said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. ""So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts' backs.""

Like being in a body cast

Much attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang's team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling.

What they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury.

In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren't using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren't bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months.

MRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. ""Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,"" Chang explained.

Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts' potential time spent in Martian gravity -- 38% of the surface gravity on Earth -- creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.

The team's future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.

Yoga in space?

Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine.

In addition to the ""fetal tuck"" position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done.

""A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit.""

Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station.

Scott Parazynski, who walked in space seven times, assisted with construction on the space station in 2007.

Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.

One of Chang's teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity.

Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.

""When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,"" he said. ""Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.

Their quest -- the latest craze in Moscow -- is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general.

It's complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.

But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.

A mad Russian general has pushed the nuclear button - and gamers must stop missiles launching

""I'm worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,"" said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.

""I know that normal people all over the world don't want any war,"" he added.

A nation preparing for conflict

But Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia's old Cold War rival.

Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack.

The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill

The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.

Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.

Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction -- or MAD -- still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War.

But with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real.

""I don't think nuclear war is likely,"" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs , a prominent foreign policy journal.

""But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don't have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,"" he told CNN.

Kremlin playing up fears

It is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.

In its flagship current affairs show, Russia's top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev -- dubbed the Kremlin's propagandist-in-chief by critics -- recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.

""Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,"" he declared.

The Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal.

The Satan 2 , as it's known, will be the world's most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia's place as a top nuclear power.

It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow.

""I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,"" said Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer.

""But it sounds ridiculous to me and I'm totally sure that war is impossible,"" she adds.

The quest game players - pretending to be a special ops team - are the only ones who can avert war

Back in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch. The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack.

Hopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/wBGZxsDnWMU/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

['Kate Springer'],Want to read your dog's mind? Japan's boom in weird wearable tech,"(CNN) What do Discman, Tamagotchi, and Game Boy have in common?

They're all landmark Japanese inventions from the 80s and 90s, symbols of an era when the Asian nation was a world leader in tech innovation.

But with the rise of Silicon Valley, and American tech giants such as Google and Apple, has seen Japan produce less era-defining tech over the past two decades.

That, says Professor Masahiko Tsukamoto, of Kobe University's Graduate School of Engineering , is about to change thanks to a new generation of young entrepreneurs, an uptick in international collaborations, and new partnerships with university scientists.

Japan's focus this time around is not on smart phones or gaming, but wearable chairs, smart glasses and dog communication devices.

In short, wacky wearable tech.

Wearable tech in Japan

In 2013, Japan sold 530,000 units of wearable tech devices, according to Yano Research Institute

That figure is predicted to leapfrog to 13.1 million units in 2017.

-- at launch, it was the largest wearable tech fair in the world with 103 exhibitors. Perhaps the best indication of the boom in this industry was the introduction of Tokyo's first Wearable Expo in 2015-- at launch, it was the largest wearable tech fair in the world with 103 exhibitors.

It has featured electronic kimonos, cat communication devices, and electronic gloves to record a pianist's finger work.

At the next show, from January 18 to 20, 2017, the organizers expect more than 200 exhibitors and 19,000 visitors.

""With better functionality, lighter components and smaller designs, wearing devices is now no longer a fantasy,"" says show director Yuhi Maezono. ""Wearables are gathering attention as the next big growth market.""

The dog whisperer

Inupathy is a dog harness slated to launch at the end of this year that will allow pet owners to communicate with their dogs.

As well as a heart monitor, the harness features noise-canceling technology which can isolate the animal's heartbeat and track its reactions to stimulus, such as food, games, people and toys.

With this data, the harness assesses a dog's mood and changes color to inform the owners.

Equipped with six LED lights, the collar glows blue to show calm, red for excitement, and displays a rainbow theme for happiness.

Joji Yamaguchi, CEO of Inupathy, was inspired by his Corgi, Akane, who was a nervous puppy. To better understand the dog's anxiety, the biologist developed Inupathy to monitor his heart rate.

""I always felt like I couldn't understand Akane very well and I wanted to get be closer to him,"" says Yamaguchi.

""Buddhism and old Japanese religion says every animals, plants, and even rocks have spirit inside. It's stressful when you can't solve problems that are upsetting them.""

Yamaguchi expects wearable wellness tracking will have applications for humans, too.

""Personalization, of artificial intelligence will be a game-changer,"" says Yamaguchi.

""For instance, if you show a certain behavior before you start feeling depressed, predicting your depression from that behavior is extremely valuable for an individual. An AI that works personally for you will eventually make this possible.""

A real life-saver

Archelis -- a wearable chair launched in Japan this year -- is also creating a buzz internationally.

A collaboration between Nitto mold factory, Chiba University, Japan Polymer Technology and Hiroaki Nishimura Design, in Japan, it was initially intended for surgeons, who need to rest their legs during long operations.

The chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.

The Archelis chair.

""The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus' egg,"" says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. ""Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain -- especially for surgeons who are older.""

Made of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries.

The innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.

The system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.

Though the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet.

Get to the point

Other wearables are on the smaller side.

Measuring about 3 inches long, BIRD is essentially a modern thimble that turns your fingertip into a magic wand.

BIRD can control up to 10 devices at a time.

Using algorithms to decode a user's intent, the device also features precise sensors that track direction, speed, and gestures.

The technology enables users to turn any surface into a smart screen, as well as interact with other smart devices.

Walking around at home, users can project a laptop screen onto a wall, switch on a coffee machine, read on any surface, and make online purchases with the point or swipe of a finger.

The developers -- Israel-based MUV Interactive and Japan-based Silicon Technology -- expect BIRD to be embraced by the education and corporate sectors, thanks to its ability to create collaborative presentations.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/0NxvfyXXT1k/index.html,CNN,Tech,True
['Susan Scutti'],Cell phones and screens are keeping your kid awake,"For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don't use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.

The analysis found ""a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,"" said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King's College London.

Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.

Few parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a ""strong and consistent association"" between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Surprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.

Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was ""how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,"" many of us will probably recognize our own families' habits reflected in the statistics.

Electronic bedroom

A large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.

According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children's sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game.

Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.

Carter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.

""Sleep is vital for children,"" said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. ""We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more.""

Kansagra, author of "" My Child Won't Sleep ,"" noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. ""It's hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.""

Kansagra said it's possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. ""For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,"" he said.

Practicing good sleep hygiene

Dr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child's healthy development, even though ""we don't know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.""

In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. ""Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,"" said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own ""personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.""

Sleep hygiene -- tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep -- include having a room that is quiet. ""And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,"" Kline said.

One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation , which recommends at least 30 minutes of ""gadget-free transition time"" before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.

Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/grZ2k7Zm__0/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

['Aimee Lewis'],With society shutting down will Tokyo 2020 go ahead?,"(CNN) As Covid-19 spreads with alacrity around the world, billion-dollar sports leagues have been brought to a halt.

Thursday in the US was one of the most extraordinary in the country's sports history as the NBA, the WNBA and the much-anticipated NCAA's men's and women's basketball tournaments were among the major events suspended or postponed.

Competitions once regarded as shatterproof have been affected. The English Premier League, often described as the world's richest soccer league, on Friday announced a suspension.

But the Olympic Games , the biggest sporting spectacle of all, is still set to go ahead, which begs the question: with society shutting down as a result of a worldwide pandemic, will the Olympics really be held in Tokyo this summer?

What has been said?

On Friday, Japan's Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto dismissed suggestions that Tokyo 2020 should be postponed.

Responding to comments made by US President Donald Trump, who had suggested the Games should be rescheduled, Hashimoto said neither the local organizing committee or the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had considered postponing or canceling the Games.

""We continue to proceed preparations to hold a safe and secure Games that will open on July 24,"" said Hashimoto.

On March 12, the day the Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia without spectators because of ongoing concerns over COVID-19, the IOC said it was ""fully committed"" to holding the Games, set to run from July 24 to August 9, in Tokyo.

""Nineteen weeks before the opening ceremony of the Games we are strengthened in our commitment by many organizations around the world taking significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus,"" Thomas Bach, the IOC president, said.

Much is still unknown

The coronavirus has infected more than 132,500 people and killed nearly 5,000 globally, according to the World Health Organization.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients, compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza, but much remains unknown about it.

Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared with neighboring South Korea and China. However, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.

The country experienced an uptick in numbers on Tuesday, with 54 more cases reported -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.

And Japan has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak, specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay.

A woman wearing a face mask walks past the Olympic rings in front of the new National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020.

Health experts have also previously raised concerns over the country's approach to testing, which has seen only small numbers screened for the virus.

Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the ""tip of the iceberg.""

This week the country canceled the annual public service in Tokyo which marks the Fukushima disaster.

The start of the baseball, football and rugby sevens seasons have already been delayed, while a major sumo tournament that opened in Osaka last weekend was held without spectators for the first time in its history.

With the Games still scheduled to go ahead, the outbreak in Japan and the government's handling of it will continue to be under heightened scrutiny.

What are the options for Tokyo 2020?

If the Games were being held now, it would be difficult to imagine how organizers could go ahead as planned. Thousands of people converging in Tokyo during a pandemic would surely not be countenanced.

But Tokyo 2020 has time. Experts hope warmer weather will help fight the virus, though it is yet unclear whether that theory is true.

The Olympic movement essentially has two opportunities to make money, at the Summer Games and the Winter Olympics, so with billions of dollars at stake, in ticket sales, hospitality and sponsorship especially, organizers are as yet unwilling to contemplate a delay or cancellation.

With the authority to cancel the Games, it is the IOC which is in control. Earlier this month, IOC member Dick Pound admitted a decision to cancel could be made as late as May.

The situation remains fluid and talk of holding the Games elsewhere has been widely quashed. As Professor Victor Matheson, a sports economist who has written on the economics of the Olympics, told CNN Sport: ""Any world where Japan is too unsafe to hold the Olympics, London is also too unsafe to hold the Olympics.""

It is widely regarded that the options available are: to hope the outbreak eases and go ahead as planned, to hold the Games without spectators, to postpone or cancel completely.

The economic costs of Tokyo 2020

Canceling the Games would be unprecedented in peacetime.

The cost of hosting, organizers said in December, was some 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion) but, according to Reuters, that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat.

According to Reuters, Japan's Board of Audit put government spending on the Games between 2013 and 2018 at 1.06 trillion yen ($9.81billion). Sponsors, insurers and broadcasters have also committed billions to the Games.

Professor Matheson believes the truer sum is likely to be $25 billion, a vast majority of which has already been spent on large-scale infrastructure projects such as transportation networks, hotels and new venues.

""Whether the Games go on or not, most of this investment is a sunk cost at this point,"" Professor Matheson said.

""If you were to cancel the Olympics, you would be able to avoid some of the costs, such as billion dollars of security, if Tokyo's security costs were similar to London, but the biggest cost is all of the infrastructure and most of that spending has already taken place.""

If the Tokyo 2020 was canceled, who'd be the losers?

Professor Matheson points to the IOC and the local organizing committee as being among the biggest losers in the event of cancellation, though both organizations will be insured.

""This isn't Delta Airlines, where we cancel a bunch of flights but once we solve the problem things are back to normal,"" he said, describing the Olympics as ""totally non-diversified.""

Another big loser would be Tokyo's hospitality industry.

""If we look at other host cities, the total number of international tourists was likely to increase by 100,000 visitors and those visitors were paying much higher room rental rates than the people they would have been replacing,"" said Matheson.

""That's potentially at least hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in lost revenue for the hospitality industry and that's probably not insurable.""

And then there are the sponsors, Matheson adds: ""If the Games don't go on at all, there are $3 billion worth of sponsorships that have been purchased and it's hard to know where that money goes if the Games don't all go on.

""That is a loss to someone, that's either a loss to broadcasters or it's a loss to the IOC, because they don't get the revenue from the contract, or it's a loss to an insurer.

""Somewhere along the line you have this valuable product that was going to produce all this TV entertainment and someone's going to lose that revenue somewhere.""

Japan's GDP, however, would not take a significant hit, said Matheson.

""In any scenario where the Olympic Games are canceled, the other costs associated with coronavirus are going to make the Olympic costs seem like a drop in the bucket.""

What is the least costly alternative for the IOC?

Postponing the Games by a few months has been mentioned as an option for the IOC should it be deemed unsafe for the Games to go ahead as scheduled.

But TV rights holders would be unhappy with having to schedule the Olympics during the NFL season in the US and the European soccer season.

After all, the Games are being held in August, despite the potential dangers the scorching weather could pose to athletes, because the wants of rights holders far outweighs that of the athletes.

If the show was unable to go on as planned, holding the Games this summer without spectators would be the least costly, according to Matheson.

Sponsors, athletes, and TV rightsholders would still have an Olympics, he said, with Japan's tourism sector being the biggest loser.

""You still need the athletes and production officials, which may still be too many people in one place during a severe outbreak. It would cost you all your tourism money and about a billion dollars in ticket revenue,"" said Matheson.

""But you still get to keep your $3-4 billion of TV rights. The athletes are still on the world stage and you get to keep the majority of your sponsorship money.

""It keeps a lot of your revenue intact and there's no scheduling issues. Postponing it by a year would be massively costly, this would be multibillions of dollars, but at least you would have all your revenue streams intact that year later.""

The National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (C-R).

What about the athletes?

Competing at the Olympics is the pinnacle for the majority of athletes taking part. Sacrifices have been made, lives put on hold, training sessions meticulously planned for a career-defining moment.

If the Games were to be canceled, so too would an athlete's shot at glory. Gone would be the opportunity to become an Olympic champion and the sponsorship opportunities that come with that. Then, there are the older athletes, those who have one final chance at greatness. There is an economic cost, and a human one too.

There are also the athletes who have yet to secure qualification. Athletes needing to improve their rankings may miss out completely because qualification events have been rescheduled. Baseball's final qualifying event, for example, has been moved from April to June.

Simone Biles is expected to be one of the star athletes at Tokyo 2020

Dave Hembrough, Sheffield Hallam University's lead for strength and conditioning, told CNN Sport said that while athletes were resilient the uncertainty would be disruptive, especially to those attempting to qualify and attending training camps.

""Those who are the best in the world will be so driven for the purpose of being the best, it won't disturb them much,"" he said.

""But if athletes don't qualify, they don't compete and it might lead to organizations not having the best athletes qualifying and, therefore, reducing the chance of winning medals.

""I'm involved with British weightlifting ... one of the things people are concerned with is the financial commitment of signing up for camps for competition, travel for hotels that are then going to be subsequently canceled. A lot of organizations cannot afford that.""

With a host of sporting events impacted by COVID-19's spread, F1 has remained resolute in its intention to start the 2020 season in Melbourne, despite having already postponed the Chinese GP.

""I am really very, very surprised that we're here,"" six-time world champion Hamilton told reporters.

""I think motorsport, I think it's great that we have races but for me, it's shocking that we're all sitting in this room. So many fans here already today and it seems like the rest of the world is reacting -- probably a little bit late.""

Hamilton also revealed he had been conscious to take preventive health measures as he traveled to Australia.

""Naturally being on a flight with god knows how many people and then stopping in an airport full of so many people, I didn't really think too hard on it,"" said the 35-year-old.

"['David Close', 'Amanda Jackson', 'Jason Hanna']",NBA suspends season after Jazz center Rudy Gobert tests positive for coronavirus,"(CNN) The NBA has suspended its season after a player preliminarily tested positive for coronavirus , stunning fans and players who heard the plan at stadiums Wednesday night, and adding to a list of daily events and activities altered by the virus' spread nationwide.

Utah Jazz all-star center Rudy Gobert tested positive, according to ESPN and other media outlets, shortly before his team's game Wednesday night against the host Oklahoma City Thunder.

The NBA postponed that game right before tip-off after it learned the diagnosis, surprising thousands of fans already in their seats at Chesapeake Energy Arena. Not long afterward, the league announced it would suspend the season ""until further notice"" after the night's slate of games around the country.

""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,"" the NBA, which announced a Jazz player had tested positive but didn't identify him, said in a statement

The affected player was not in the arena, the league said. The player is in the care of health officials in Oklahoma City, according to the Jazz, which also did not name the player.

Four other NBA games were played Wednesday night -- but one other, a tilt between the New Orleans Pelicans and the Sacramento Kings in California, was called off because a referee assigned to work the game had previously worked a Jazz game, the NBA said.

The NBA's suspension is an outlier for professional sports in the United States, a country more used to seeing leagues stop or shrink seasons because of labor issues or, more rarely, war

The coronavirus pandemic has forced many US sports organizations to consider adjustments, including canceling events and holding games without fans. The National Hockey League said Wednesday night it is still evaluating the options and will have an update on Thursday.

In Oklahoma City, players for both teams were on the court for warm-ups but were abruptly called back to the locker rooms.

""And then boom, a guy in a suit started a joint conversation with all the referees, then both head coaches -- next thing you knew the Jazz went into the locker room and then the Thunder,"" he said.

The public address announcer first told the crowd the game was delayed and awaiting league approval to go forward, offering no other details.

Eventually, the announcer told fans the game was called off, that they were safe, and to please leave the arena. Fans shouted in surprise.

In Dallas, the Denver Nuggets' contest against the Dallas Mavericks continued, and finished with a Mavericks win. But as news of the NBA's decision to suspend the season after Wednesday night spread during that game, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was seen in the stadium reacting with shock as he and others learned of the decisions on their phones.

""This is people's lives at stake, this isn't about basketball, this isn't about the Mavericks,"" Cuban said after the game. ""This is a global pandemic, where people's lives are at stake.""

Jazz's statement

In a statement, the Utah Jazz said a player on the team tested negative for influenza, strep throat and an upper respiratory infection Wednesday morning.

""The individual's symptoms diminished over the course of today, however, in a precautionary measure, and in consultation and cooperation with NBA medical staff and Oklahoma health officials, the decision was made to test for COVID-19,"" the team said.

""We wish this player a full and speedy recovery, and appreciate the work of health officials in Oklahoma to test a member of the Utah Jazz for COVID-19, as well as their prudent decision to test the entire team at this time,"" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said in a joint statement.

They added that they are working to identify people who have had close enough contact with the player as to have been potentially exposed.

Evan Fournier, a guard with the Orlando Magic and a friend of Gobert, tweeted that he has been in touch with Gobert.

""Was just on the phone with Rudy. He is doing good man. Lets not panick everyone. Love you all,"" Fournier tweeted

Reaction around the league

That close contact makes coronavirus a concern for the rest of the league, Detroit Pistons head coach Dwane Casey said following the announcement.

Casey and other figures in the league said the suspension was the right move until officials have a better grasp on the situation.

""We are not going to speculate on what we are going to do. We are going to regroup. We just heard about this five minutes ago. It's the utmost importance that our fans, our players, and our staff we feel safe and are safe,"" Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand said.

Atlanta Hawks head coach Lloyd Pierce said that the virus affecting the league happened despite preventative efforts, and the decision to suspend is the right move.

['George Ramsay'],How an open water swimmer braved freezing water to uncover Antarctica's 'dark secret',"(CNN) Once he had overcome the aching, agonizing cold of the water -- and while he continued to negotiate a tunnel cluttered with enormous stalactites -- Lewis Pugh was struck by the colors.

This was like nothing he had seen before, a kaleidoscope that twisted between turquoise, electric blue, royal blue, indigo and violet, before darkness took over.

Pugh had risked his life by plunging into Antarctic water in just a pair of skin-tight swimming trunks; the rewards were as mesmerizing as they were unsettling.

""I don't think I've ever seen anything as beautiful as that, just the sheer colors,"" Pugh, who has swum in some of the world's most remote waters as UN Patron of the Oceans, tells CNN Sport.

""But it was also incredibly terrifying ... The colors were magnificent, but they hid a dark secret. And I say it's a secret because people seem to be ignoring it.""

Pugh swam down a sub-glacial river underneath the Antarctic ice sheet in January, and in doing so experienced firsthand the level of melting that is taking place in East Antarctica.

Over the course of the 10-minute swim, he braved water temperatures of 0.1 degrees centigrade and air temperatures of minus 15.

The feat is part of a foolhardy initiative dubbed ""Speedo diplomacy,"" in which Pugh takes himself and his swimming trunks to the frontline line of climate change.

He has swum at the North Pole, Everest, and the Ross Sea, but the circumstances surrounding the most recent expedition in Antarctica proved unique.

""I could barely breathe, I was gasping for air,"" says Pugh, recalling the moment he first entered the water.

""The cold initially, it's burning all over my skin. My hands and my feet were in absolute agony. My body is saying get out, get out, get out. My mind is saying focus, focus, focus.

""It's not about bravado, it's about sending the right message. I don't think swimming in a wetsuit or a drysuit sends the right message.""

When Pugh reached the end of his swim, he was hauled out of the water by Russian ice hockey great and close friend Slava Fetisov.

""His skin felt so fragile, like (it could have) broken up into little pieces in a second,"" Fetisov, an Olympic gold medalist in 1984 and 1988, tells CNN Sport.

""I've never seen a man be cold like that ... But in his eyes there was so much life and so much hope.""

Pugh is helped out of the water by close friend and ice hockey great Slava Fetisov.

The temperature of the water was just one hurdle Pugh had to overcome.

He was forced to take slow, deliberate strokes as the tunnel he was swimming down started to narrow. Huge stalactites hung from the tunnel roof; knocking one could have been catastrophic.

Then there was the threat of falling ice and of being sucked down a moulin -- a giant sinkhole in the ice sheet that plummets hundreds of meters to the bedrock.

It became so dark at one point on his swim that Pugh was forced to remove his goggles and swim careful breaststroke to find his way.

""I had to be 100% focused,"" he says.

""I focused on every single stroke, trying to make it as powerful and as forward-moving as possible. It's important when you're swimming in those environments to be psyched up, but not psyched out.""

Pugh examines a glacial tunnel where stalactites hang from the roof.

The aim of the expedition was to convince policy makers to introduce a marine protected area in East Antarctica.

Similar to national parks, these protect certain parts of the world from extractive and destructive activities -- in the case of Antarctica, industrial overfishing -- and make them more resilient to climate change.

Having already negotiated a marine protection area in the Ross Sea in 2016, this year Pugh hopes to agree to three more, one in East Antarctica, one in the Weddell Sea and one on the Antarctic Peninsula.

Collectively, this would cover four million square kilometers -- roughly double the size of Western Europe, according to Pugh -- with China and Russia still needed to agree to the proposal.

Upon returning from Antarctica, Pugh traveled to the Kremlin to meet with Vladimir Putin's team, where he says he had ""very warm and constructive discussions."" He hopes to travel to Beijing later this year.

Pugh (right) met with President Putin's team alongside Fetisov (second right) earlier this year.

""It all just reaffirms my view that we now need to join the dots,"" says Pugh.

""Because I've seen the Arctic sea ice melt, we've all seen these horrific fires in California and in Australia , and I've seen glaciers retreat all over the world -- in the Himalayas, in the Arctic and in the Antarctic.

""But now to see an enormous ice sheet and just to see so much water flowing off an enormous ice sheet. It is very, very, very concerning.""

Pugh has witnessed accelerated melting of ice in Antarctica.

Earlier this year, scientists at the University of Durham revealed that there were 65,000 supraglacial lakes -- that is, lakes on top of a glacier -- in East Antarctica.

In November, world leaders will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26 , the main United Nations climate change negotiations for the year.

""We need world leaders now to step up, to be courageous, or to step aside,"" says Pugh.

""They need to come prepared, they must come with ambition, they must come with focus, they must come with concrete measures which can turn this crisis around ... Time has now run out.""

Fetisov, who supported Pugh throughout the Antarctica expedition, introduced the Briton to the Russian ministers needed to sign the Ross Sea agreement in 2016.

Fetisov (left) and Pugh speak in Moscow following their Antarctica expedition.

The pair are long-time friends, bound by the shared belief that, in Fetisov's words, we are ""a step away from a huge ecological catastrophe.""

It's what has motivated the former ice hockey star, who won his seven world championship and two Olympic titles in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, to raise awareness of the climate crisis. In 2018, he was appointed UN Environment Patron for Polar Regions.

""I played defense all my life and I feel it,"" says Fetisov. ""It's time to defend.

""I can't look in the eyes of children and young people and say no, it's probably not going to happen -- it is going to happen.""

His latest project, ""The Last Game,"" involves traveling the world -- they've been to Israel, the UAE, Finland, Singapore, Moscow and New York -- to raise awareness of climate change.

The next stop, weather permitting, is to take the initiative to the North Pole.

Fetisov, a fearsome defenseman in his playing days, believes sport can be a powerful player when it comes to the environment.

""Athletes are the most popular people on the planet,"" he says.

""They can gain trust from citizens because they work hard, they know about results and know how to get everybody in a team on the same page.

""Every day around the world we've got big sport competitions. We can use sport more and more to promote ecological problems, that's my belief.""

Fetisov participates in a ""Last Game"" event in New York.

Growing up in Moscow, Fetisov used to skate outside from October until April. By February this year, he says, there was no snow on the ground in the Russian capital.

You don't always need to swim in freezing Antarctic waters to witness the impact of climate change, but Pugh and Fetisov hope the ripples of their latest expedition will be felt around the world.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/ZVyK7XFyP1g/index.html,CNN,Sports,True
"['Ben Church', 'Cnn Video Produced Noura Abou Zeinab']",The 'Queen' of Cheer reveals how Netflix mega-hit changed her life,"(CNN) Inspirational, but tough as nails, Monica Aldama is a coach you don't want to mess about with or disappoint.

Aldama is very much the star of Netflix's latest mega-hit Cheer -- the six-part series which reveals the world of cheerleading at its mesmerizing, bone-crunching and jaw-dropping best.

Mapping the season of Navarro College's dominant cheer squad, the viral sensation has changed the way thousands of people view the sport.

Dedication, sacrifice and hours of practice are laid bare as young athletes from across the US find sanctuary in the most unlikely of places.

""I'm very competitive and I want to be successful but I also want to be that person that leads by example. I really set a high standard for myself,"" Aldama, who has become known as the ""Queen of Cheer,"" told CNN Sport.

""If I expect something from my kids, I should expect it from myself too. I shouldn't even have to say anything but my actions will lead the kids and they'll do the things I'm doing.""

Cheer coach Monica Aldama spoke to CNN Sport about life after the Netflix show.

Ellen and Oprah

Aldama had already established herself as one of the best cheer coaches in the sport, but not even she could have prepared herself for what happened next.

Appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Oprah's live tour catapulted the entire team to stardom and shone a bright light on Aldama's unrivaled success and methods.

Her glittering career has included 14 National Championships as a coach and her style has been compared to some of sports' most revered leaders.

""It's very strange, because I've had so many people view me in different ways after watching this show,"" Aldama said. ""Some people love me, some people don't.

""I know where my heart is and I know what happened the other four months that were not in those six hours. I would not change anything.""

The kids Aldama continually refers to throughout the show are the young adults who manage to secure a place on her acclaimed team.

It's an elite squad made up of students from a variety of backgrounds from all over the US, uniting together in a remote corner of Texas as they are rigorously drilled to compete at the very top of their game.

For many of the teenagers, a place in Aldama's team is a ticket out of trouble and a chance to make a better life for themselves.

The series, directed by Greg Whiteley, highlights the often harrowing back stories of some of the cheerleaders and Aldama is acutely aware that her role stretches way beyond coaching complex acrobatic moves.

She is as much a mother figure to her students as she is a coach, soaking up their anxieties and pushing them to succeed in both their personal and professional lives.

The docuseries follows the Navarro College cheer team in their pursuit of success.

Aldama helps create mind-blowing routines.

'I don't have to prove myself'

One of the young people to flourish under Aldama's wing is Morgan Simianer

The talented gymnast has become one of the breakout stars from the show, with her complicated history providing the series with one of its most emotional moments.

We learn how Simianer was forced to raise herself in a trailer after her biological parents abandoned her at an early age, but how that turbulent childhood gave her an unwavering drive to succeed.

It's an attitude that comes across crystal clear in a series where her loyalty to Aldama, who seems to provide a pillar of stability in Simianer's life, is resolute.

""I've really tried to work over the years on being better at that and just learning what I could do to fill those roles for those kids,"" added Aldama as she reflected on the complexity of coaching the team.

""I think that's really why I'm still here, it's not cheerleading. I've won plenty of titles, I don't have to prove myself there. It's the relationship with the kids and the feeling of watching them succeed.

""I feel like it's God's purpose for me and that's why I haven't left the job yet.""

Make no mistake, as much as Navarro College is a sanctuary for many, corners are never cut in the constant search for success.

Aldama demands nothing but 100% dedication to the cause with eyes firmly set on the annual National Championship in Daytona, scene of the thrilling finale to the series.

Her mantra is to ""keep going until you get it right, and then you keep going until you can't get it wrong,"" though that level of expectation pushes her charges to the very edge of their physical and emotional capabilities.

Morgan Simianer is one of the young cheerleaders who features in the show.

Injury heavy

Aldama's trademark moves -- breathtaking somersaults, tumbles, and stunning pyramids -- combine to deliver an explosive two minutes and 15 seconds routine which can occasionally go wrong.

""They showed every time we fell but they didn't show the one thousand times that we did it right or the progressions that we did to build up to the harder skills,"" said Aldama when asked whether the series gave an accurate depiction of the program she runs.

""We definitely are very safe, but it is cheerleading. It's a risky sport that we're doing but we do take precautions and I think that it was just a little heavy on the injuries.""

What's not in doubt is that the special culture forged at the college seems to encourage its stars to push through blood, sweat, and tears for the sake of the team ethic.

Notably former squad members return to help mentor the latest crop, a feature of the program that Monica takes immense pride in.

However, her coaching style is not just with competition in mind. Preparing these young adults for life in the real world is equally important to her.

""Self-accountability is just such a big thing for me, because so many people in this day and age, want to shift the blame to others and just not take responsibility for their own actions,"" Aldama said.

""If you've made a commitment to be somewhere, then you should show up. If it's class, then you should show up. If it's practice, you should show up. If it's a job, you should show up.""

Aldama said the training is very safe despite the show focusing on injuries.

True athletes

As well as enhancing the Navarro College cheer team's reputation, Aldama hopes the hit show can also help the sport establish itself in the mainstream.

So often viewed through the lens of tired stereotypes, the show has given the sport a platform to show just how athletic it can be when done properly.

""These kids are honestly some of the toughest kids I know. The work ethic that these kids have is top notch, they will come in and work, work, work. Work through the pain,"" Aldama added.

""The commitment is unreal. I just didn't feel like people who aren't a part of this world really knew that these kids are that athletic and that they have that grit and that determination.

""I was hoping that the world would see them as the true athletes that they are.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/WRJHX_wI8qU/index.html,CNN,Sports,True

['Matias Grez'],Atletico Madrid stuns Liverpool at Anfield to dump holder out of the Champions League,"(CNN) Atletico Madrid stunned Liverpool with three goals in extra time to knock the holders out of the Champions League.

With the tie level at the end of the 90 minutes thanks to Georginio Wijnaldum's header, Roberto Firmino looked to have scored the tie-winning goal just four minutes into extra time.

But two goals from substitute Marcos Llorente in the space of eight minutes, the first courtesy of a howler from stand-in keeper Adrian, drew the sides level on the night and gave Atletico the lead on aggregate.

Anfield was stunned into total silence as coach Jurgen Klopp looked bemused on the touchline, arms held out disbelievingly.

Alvaro Morata scored the third in the final few seconds to secure a memorable 4-2 aggregate win for Atletico.

This stadium had been the site of one of the greatest ever Champions League comebacks last season, as Liverpool overturned a 3-0 first-leg deficit against Barcelona to reach the final.

Tonight, it's the site of one of Liverpool's most painful European defeats.

Atletico Madrid celebrate Marcos Llorente's second goal.

Pantomime villain

There would have been more than a few hearts in mouths inside the opening 20 seconds at Anfield, as Joao Felix's slick turn and pass set Diego Costa through on goal.

The Spanish striker, a familiar foe for Liverpool from his time at Chelsea, could only skew his shot into the side netting but it was an early reminder for Liverpool of the quality that Atletico Madrid possesses going forward.

Costa was soon slipping into his preferred role of pantomime villain, petulantly throwing the ball away as Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian attempted to take a quick free-kick.

It was a tactic Atletico had been expected to employ in an attempt to frustrate both the Liverpool fans and players into submission and reduce the game to a scrappy affair.

They succeeded in doing exactly that but Liverpool was giving as good as it was getting, ferociously snapping into tackles with

From the outset, Anfield wasn't quite at its famous levels of noise -- perhaps the torrential rain had dampened the atmosphere somewhat -- but Wijnaldum's stinging strike, palmed away brilliantly by Jan Oblak, was enough to spark the crowd into life.

Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates his opening goal.

As had been expected, Liverpool dominated possession inside the opening 30 minutes but, Wijnaldum's effort aside, hadn't troubled Atletico's back line.

Diego Simeone's side is widely considered the best defensive unit in European football and as Liverpool's attacks were repelled again and again, it sometimes felt as though it was crossing balls into a brick wall.

But Liverpool's pressure eventually started to tell and a few of those bricks started coming loose; Wijnaldum once again tested Oblak before he eventually found a way through.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found the Dutchman totally unmarked in the middle of the penalty area and he directed his header down into the wet turf and into the top corner.

Wijnaldum is making a habit of scoring big goals for Liverpool in the Champions League; last season, he scored a brace to haul Liverpool level in that famous semifinal comeback win against Barcelona.

Anfield roared into life and Atletico's players spent the remaining two minutes of the first half desperately waiting for the half-time whistle to blow.

Backs to the wall

Those 15 minutes respite changed very little and Atleti's players were back out in the second half and immediately had their backs to the wall.

Again they had Oblak to thank for keeping them level in the tie, as the Slovenian stopper did brilliantly to save efforts from Oxlande-Chamberlain and Roberto Firmino.

But midway through the second half, Liverpool was given a sharp warning of how quickly this tie could change.

Felix, Atletico's $142 million star signing, managed to wriggle free on the edge of the area and his deflected effort brought an awkward save out of Adrian.

Liverpool's stand-in keeper should have dealt with the effort comfortably but presented Angel Correa with an opportunity from his weak parry, though he did eventually manage to smother the ball.

With little more than 20 minutes remaining, the whole of Anfield thought Liverpool had found the tie-winning goal.

Marcos Llorente celebrates his second goal in extra time.

After ricocheting around in the box, the ball found its way to Andy Robertson at the far post but Kieran Trippier did brilliantly to get a slight touch on the header and deflect it onto the crossbar.

In the dying seconds, totally against the run of play, Atleti thought it had found the winner.

Renan Lodi's free-kick into the box was met by Saul Niguez's thumping header into the top corner. The 3,000 Atletico fans behind that goal went wild, as did the entire Atleti bench, but their celebrations were cut short by the linesman's flag for an obvious offside.

30 minutes of madness

Extra time started at a blistering pace and Firmino, with his first Anfield goal all season, looked to have secured passage through to the quarterfinals, reacting fastest after his header had hit the post to stab the rebound home.

But then it was the turn of Adrian to take center stage, the player called upon the least throughout the 90 minutes and as much of a spectator as the 60,000 fans inside Anfield.

The Spaniard's scuffed clearance gifted the ball to substitute Llorente, who did brilliantly to bend the ball into the vacant far corner of the goal.

Then, just like that, it was two.

Some lazy defending from both Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk gifted Llorente with space on the edge of the area and he curled another unerring strike into the bottom corner.

Anfield was silent, save for the small pocket of delirious Atletico fans at the opposite end of the stadium.

With seconds remaining, Alvaro Morata popped up to score Atelti's third and emphatically seal passage through to the quarterfinals.

['Matias Grez'],"Historic women's deal 'reward for all the hard work we've been putting in for years,' says Spain star","(CNN) The Spanish league that Marta Corredera made her debut in more than a decade ago is almost unrecognizable to the one she plays in today.

In the 12 years since she first appeared for Espanyol, attendances have increased, a television deal has been agreed and a major title sponsor has been signed.

However, last month saw the biggest and most important change of them all as the female players in Spain's top division secured an historic league-wide agreement that will guarantee every footballer an annual salary.

The minimum full-time player wage agreed for a 40-hour week is €16,000 ($18,000) and for a part-time 30-hour week is €12,000 ($13,600), with both including maternity leave, injury pay and paid holiday.

""It's the reward for all the hard work we've been putting in for years,"" Corredera, who now plays for Levante, tells CNN.

""In the end, not only as female footballers but any female workers we have the rights to have laws and rules that shelter us and protect us -- until now we were totally unprotected.

Marta Corredera playing for Spain's history making team at the 2019 Women's World Cup.

""In any situation of unemployment, injury, including maternity, Spanish female footballers didn't have that law that protected them. Now with this new agreement we've taken a step forward in that regard, that players feel secure and, above all, valued for what they are doing as their job.""

The association of clubs (ACFF) and several players' unions had been locked in negotiations over the league's collective bargaining agreement for almost 18 months, until an agreement was finally reached at the end of February.

Much of the delay was down to the ACFF refusing to meet the wage demands for part-time players, which it proposed should have been €8,000 ($9,000) instead of the €12,000 ($13,600) that was eventually agreed on.

The stall in negotiations forced the players to take drastic action.

In November, the footballers boycotted all eight first division matches during one gameweek, after 189 representatives from the league's 16 clubs voted 93% in favor of taking strike action.

""We all know well that when the population mobilizes is when people realize that things need to change,"" Corredera says. ""We had been asking for this agreement for some time, for them to confirm it and come to an agreement.

""I think clubs as well as the association didn't think that the players would come together and strike. We showed that strength of everyone together and being united was what helped open people's eyes and show that we were serious, that really wanted this agreement and would do everything we possibly could to achieve it.""

The strike convinced the clubs to reopen negotiations as they successfully sought funding from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) -- which pays clubs €350,000 ($397,000) per season -- and through a television rights deal to meet the players' demands.

Closing the gap

For Corredera, the new deal caps off a startling rise for Spanish women's football, both domestically and internationally.

The versatile winger left Spain in 2015 to play for Arsenal in the Women's Super League and won both the FA Cup and WSL Cup during her time in England.

France's top tier is widely considered the best in Europe, though arguably the talent is far more concentrated at the top of the division compared to larger spread in England's WSL.

Lyon has dominated the Champions League in recent seasons, winning the last four editions, while French clubs have made up five of the last eight finalists.

However, Spain had its breakthrough year in the competition last season as Barcelona became the first Spanish club in Champions League history to reach either the semifinals or the final.

Barcelona became the first Spanish team to reach either the semifinal or final or the Champions League.

Though Barcelona eventually lost 4-1 to Lyon, Correrdera believes it's evidence that the gap is closing between Spain and its rival European leagues; indeed, the country is guaranteed another semifinalist with Barca and Atletico Madrid facing off in this season's quarterfinals.

""It's completely different now than it was before,"" she says of the league's quality. ""Above all, the level of the players, the level of the matches have increased a lot.

""The matches are a lot more difficult to win because the level of the players has grown. This is down to the fact they are training a lot better, there are trainers, fitness coaches that are more prepared, that understand and work with the female body because we are different (to men).

""Thanks to the clubs, the federation, our whole environment, we're improving. Television is supporting us a lot more and people see us more in their homes, people go to games more. We're more visible and started to have more significance in society.

""We all know that those leagues have been working for many years on a good trajectory and that gives them an advantage over us, but I think we're getting closer to those countries and leagues because here in Spain we're working really well.

""That's cut the distance, we need to carry on like this and the generations that are coming up are also making their mark and I think that will help us achieve success in the present or near future.""

Corredera has lofty ambitions this season both at club and international level.

Her Levante side, which she says has the perfect blend of youth and experience, sits in third place in the league -- just five points behind Atletico Madrid in second -- and is dreaming of qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2009.

Marta Corredera goes past the USWNT's Megan Rapinoe during the She Believes Cup clash.

Corredera was part of the Spain squad at last summer's Women's World Cup that made history with the country's first ever appearance in the knockout stages.

The national team has since gone from strength to strength and earned an invitation to this year's She Believes Cup, the annual four-team tournament held in the United States.

Spain secured an impressive 3-1 against Japan in the opening match, totally dominating the 2011 World Cup winner, before narrowly losing 1-0 to reigning world champion the USWNT.

Corredera and her teammates go into Wednesday's deciding matches with an outside chance of winning the title; they'll need to secure victory against a strong England team and hope that Japan can upset the US.

""The She Believes Cup is a tournament we've always watched from a distance and now we have the luck to be able to enjoy it ourselves,"" she says.

""We need to try to learn and above all enjoy the experience, compete at our maximum and achieve good results because I think this team is capable of doing that.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_football/~3/biZ9RdrZr8U/index.html,CNN,Sports,True

['Matias Grez'],Thrilling RB Leipzig runs riot to dump Jose Mourinho and Tottenham out of the Champions League,"(CNN) Outplayed, outgunned and outcoached, Jose Mourinho was powerless to stop his Totttenham side suffering a Champions League exit at the hands of RB Leipzig.

Mourinho lamented his injury crisis after the first leg , describing the defeat as going into ""a gunfight without bullets.""

On Tuesday, Mourinho didn't even have the luxury of turning up to the second leg with an empty gun.

Leipzig was again totally dominant for 90 minutes, only this time it took advantage with two early goals to seal a 3-0 win courtesy of captain Marcel Sabitzer's brace and Emil Forsberg late strike.

With just two draws and four defeats from his last six matches, Mourinho is currently suffering the longest winless streak of his 935-match managerial career and is without a win in the Champions League knockout stages for six years.

""I was very positive yesterday and that's the way I have to be all the time, if I'm not positive it's better not to come to the game,"" a philosophical Mourinho told BT Sport after the match. ""Yes I'm positive, I motivate the players and yes we all believed but we know that in this moment (with injuries) it's all very difficult.

Jose Mourinho was powerless to prevent his Tottenham side crashing out of Europe.

""They are a very, very strong side ... and after our first couple of mistakes they score and the game of course is very, very difficult. They deserved to go through, they were the best team. If I can be critical, I keep it for us. Sometimes difficult moments are moments that can prepare the future in a better way.

""Of course there is nobody to blame when it looks like we have a traumatic injury and every traumatic injury ends with months and months (out). It's very hard and the players they gave everything. People can say 'excuses' but I'm pretty sure it's bad for anyone and I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation.""

Tottenham was lucky to come away from that first leg just one goal behind after RB Leipzig dominated for the vast majority of the match.

Aside from a late flurry of attacks in the closing stages, Spurs spent most of the game on the back foot -- but the opening 10 minutes of the second leg very much reflected the closing 10 minutes of the first.

Mourinho appeared to set out his side in far more attacking fashion; the forward trio of Erik Lamelo, Dele Alli and Lucas Moura were snapping at the heels of Leipzig's defenders and looked lively every time they streamed forward.

However, Julian Nagelsmann's Leipzig is a sight to behold when attacking at full tilt, and in the blink of an eye had turned defense into attack to double its advantage on aggregate.

On a trademark blistering counterattack, Leipzig's first of the match, star striker Timo Werner reacted quickest to his blocked shot and laid the loose ball off to Sabitzer on the edge of the area.

The captain hit a low first time shot that Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris got a hand to but couldn't keep out.

Marcel Sabitzer celebrates after scoring his opening goal.

And if there were question marks over Lloris failed attempt at a save for the first goal, alarm bells were ringing for the second.

It was Sabitzer again with the goal, turning Angelino's cross in at the near post with his head. Lloris was once again well positioned and got a strong hand to the ball, but once again failed to prevent the goal.

Deja vu?

Given the Spurs now needed three away goals to progress to the next round, it would seem remiss to not talk about last season's comeback from the same position against Ajax in the semifinals.

On that famous night in Amsterdam, Tottenham did indeed find the three second-half goals it needed to progress to the final, though any lingering hopes of deja vu in Leipzig were quickly dispelled in the second half.

The host was utterly dominant, sucking the life out of what were now weary Tottenham legs and tired heads.

Leipzig did eventually put the Spurs out of its misery with just three minutes remaining, as Forsberg reacted first to a loose ball and poked home with his first touch since coming on as a substitute just seconds earlier.

For a club playing in the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in its history, Leipzig already looks well and truly at home.

Seven goals, no fans

In the night's other match, Valencia and Atalanta shared seven goals between them -- and 12 overall on aggregate -- but sadly there were no fans to witness it.

Last week, it was announced that the match would be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak, as Spain's health ministry said it wanted to avoid ""large gatherings of fans.""

Valencia and Atalanta played their match in front of empty stands.

Leading 4-1 from the first leg, Atalanta -- appearing in the Champions League for the first time in its history -- scored an early opening goal through Josip Ilicic's penalty to end the game as a contest, but it certainly didn't end it as a spectacle.

When Kevin Gameiro equalized on the night for the host, there was an audible roar from the Valencia fans that were gathered outside the stadium to watch the match.

In fairness to the stadium announcer, he lacked no enthusiasm when announcing Gameiro as the goalscorer over the speaker system.

Another five goals were scored, including a hat-trick for Ilicic, as Atalanta ran out 4-3 winner on the night and 8-4 on aggregate.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_football/~3/caMEBTiVUZg/index.html,CNN,Sports,True

Juve's 2-0 win over Inter Milan was one of the biggest matches in Serie A this season and a potentially defining result in the race for the Scudetto, but nobody was at the Allianz Stadium in Turin to witness it.

Italy is the European country hardest hit by the novel coronavirus and is still struggling to get the outbreak under control; there are now more than 7,300 cases in the country and 366 deaths.

Authorities took extraordinary measures this weekend by locking down much of the north of the country in an attempt to stop the virus spreading, restricting travel for more than 15 million people.

Inter Milan and Juventus players compete in an empty stadium due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

While the large-scale quarantine only affects the north, other restrictions have been placed on the rest of the country -- schools, university classes, theaters and cinemas, bars, nightclubs and sports events have all been suspended.

['Analysis Brian Lowry'],The movies that predicted an outbreak like coronavirus,"(CNN) Amid fears stoked by the coronavirus, ""Contagion"" -- a 2011 movie about a pandemic with potentially eerie similarities to recent events -- has been climbing up the iTunes rental charts, reflecting how people often use fiction as a means to process reality.

Yet that film is only one example of a recurring theme in movies associated with such an outbreak, a longtime staple of science fiction that has always been informed by science fact.

Not surprisingly, the Hollywood version of global pandemics has frequently spiraled off in fantastic directions, birthing armies of zombies in movies like ""The Omega Man,"" ""World War Z"" and ""Pandemic.""

Adapted from a comic book, the movie casts the heavily muscled star as a zombie killing machine, in what amounts to a superhero origin story with more twists than expected, but ultimately a simple-minded excuse for lots and lots of action.

Diesel plays Ray Garrison, a soldier introduced on a perilous mission before getting kidnapped and killed -- and that's all before the opening titles.

Ray's resurrection comes courtesy of RST corporation, just your average shadowy research facility that turns wounded warriors into super-soldiers with Robocop-like enhancements.

Ray, however, is its masterpiece, with the company having borrowed bodies from the military before perfecting nanotechnology that not only brought him back but turns him into a a near-unstoppable force, capable of almost instantly regenerating when damaged. Think Wolverine, minus the claws.

He's described as a multi-billion-dollar prototype (take that, ""Six Million Dollar Man""), under the stewardship of tech visionary Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce, kind of slumming it).

['Review Brian Lowry'],Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much in 'Big Time Adolescence',"(CNN) Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much as a performer playing a 20-something slacker in ""Big Time Adolescence,"" a Hulu-bound movie that's most surprising for what it isn't. Somewhat ironically, the main flaw with this earnest film built around a directionless character is its lack of a clear objective.

Buying into the premise requires a bit of leeway to get started: During high school, Davidson's Zeke dated the older sister of Mo (Griffin Gluck), and remained his pal after they broke up. Now Mo's a 16-year-old high school student -- with all the attendant insecurities -- and Zeke, at 23, mostly enjoys getting high and playing video games.

That the two remain near-inseparable seems odd to, well, pretty much everyone, perhaps especially Mo's dad (Jon Cryer). Yet the family tolerates the situation, which will gradually have pretty significant consequences (foreshadowed in a pre-credit sequence) as Mo's budding adolescence runs into Zeke's Peter Pan-like case of arrested development.

For Davidson, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star whose off-screen life is generally more interesting than his on-screen contributions, Zeke certainly offers an easy transition to movies, though the central focus is actually Gluck, whose struggles with all the usual teen troubles are complicated by Zeke's been-there advice and generally bad influence.

Mo insists Zeke is ""a nice guy once you get to know him,"" but his cavalier attitude -- toward everything from his retail job to relationships -- doesn't always make him the most sterling counselor. That includes his suggestion that Mo become the source of booze and pot for a circle of ""friends"" that not surprisingly mushrooms after learning that he can supply them.

What happened

According to Hanks, he and his wife were alerted to something being wrong after they ""felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches.""

""Rita had some chills that came and went,"" he wrote on his Instagram post. ""Slight fevers too.""

The couple were tested for the coronavirus, he wrote, and found to be positive.

How it happened

Neither Hanks nor Wilson have said how they may have contracted the virus.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, they are two of seven new cases that were reported in Queensland on Thursday.

An official with Queensland Health, the Australian government department which is overseeing efforts to control the outbreak of the disease in that area, did not name the couple but said all of the new cases ""contracted the illness outside Australia and traveled to Queensland with the virus,"" the publication reported.

Their ages

Both Hanks and Wilson are 63 years old, which puts them in the category of ""older adults"" who, according to experts, are the most susceptible to becoming seriously ill from the virus.

How they are doing

Chet Hanks posted a video on Instagram, saying he had just talked with them and ""They both are fine.""

""They're not even that sick. They're not worried about it,"" the younger Hanks said. ""They're not trippin' but they're going through the necessary health precautions obviously.""

Colin Hanks tweeted his gratitude for the support his family has received.

""My parents are receiving excellent care in Australia and doing well (and in good spirits) given the circumstances,"" he wrote. ""Despite the fact I'm in LA and haven't seen them in over three weeks, we have been in constant contact and am confident that they will make a full recovery.""

What's next

According to Hanks, he and his wife are taking it one day at a time.

""The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?""

['Marianne Garvey'],Kate Beckinsale posts powerful response to Harvey Weinstein's prison sentence,"(CNN) Kate Beckinsale posted a powerful response to Harvey Weinstein's 23-year prison sentence, calling it a ""huge relief.""

Beckinsale shared her own allegations of harassment by Weinstein in 2017. In an Instagram post Wednesday, she recalled the premiere of her Weinstein-produced film ""Serendipity"" in 2001, when the mood following 9/11 was somber.

""These photos were taken at the premiere of Serendipity on October 5, 2001. We all refused to go because holding a premiere mere weeks after 9/11 with the city still smoking felt like the most insensitive, tone deaf, disrespectful idea possible. But Harvey insisted. We flew into New York and somehow got through it,"" Beckinsale explained.

Weinstein verbally abused, Becksinsale said, for wearing a pantsuit to the premiere.

""The next morning Harvey called me and asked if I would like to bring my less than two year old daughter to his house for a playdate with his similar aged daughter I said ok. I turned up and he immediately called for his nanny to take the babies to another room to play,"" Beckinsale wrote. ""I went to go with them and he said 'No, you wait here.'""

['Karla Cripps'],New 'Jungle Bubbles' invite travelers to sleep next to elephants in Thailand's Golden Triangle,"Chiang Rai, Thailand (CNN) — Elephants don't sleep much. They eat loudly. They pass gas loudly, too.

The two transparent domes sit next to a large enclosure inhabited by three rescued elephants, which are cared for by the resort's Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation

Related content 20 stunning new Asia Pacific luxury hotels to check into in 2020

Guests can sit back and watch as these female elephants play with the strategically placed ""toys"" that hang from large trees, their powerful trunks occasionally ripping off huge chunks of bark and branches, sending loud cracks through the evening air.

But really, they mainly just want to eat.

Thankfully, a hefty supply of sugar cane is placed within eyesight of the bubbles, meaning the elephants are almost always just a few steps away.

Once-in-a-lifetime experience

l e v a r t

The bubbles are booked as an ""experience"" in addition to your reserved resort room, for 17,700 baht (US$563) per night per couple. This means you can just pack an overnight bag and leave the rest of your belongings in your suite.

Guests are picked up from the lobby just before sunset, then driven down a dirt road in an open-air jeep before taking a short walk through the resort's rice paddy to get to the bubbles.

Shortly after arrival, staff deliver an evening picnic basket, filled with pre-selected sandwiches and other cold dishes, allowing you to eat alongside the animals. There's a strict ""no hands"" policy when it comes to the elephants though -- bubble guests are not allowed to touch or feed them.

So how comfortable are the bubbles?

Each air-conditioned, pressurized 22-square-meter space is a mini slice of luxury, furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. There's a small washroom with a toilet and shower, along with a couple of chairs and a small table near the bed. No TVs here -- the elephants are the star of this show.

Sensitive sleepers will find It particularly surreal. As night passed during a recent visit, the moon made its way over the bubble, offering various levels of illumination. (Eye masks are provided as it can be surprisingly bright.)

Given these ladies don't nod off much -- elephants in captivity sleep only 4-6 hours a day -- you'll hear all sorts of delightful sounds throughout the night and might find yourself crawling out of bed for a late-night peek.

The bed features wrap-around curtains, offering privacy for those who worry they won't wake up before the caretakers arrive with the elephants' breakfast.

Trial and error

The idea for the ""Jungle Bubbles"" came from General Manager Gaudéric Harang, who has been with the resort for about a year and a half. He says they were born of a desire to push the boundaries and offer a unique guest experience in line with modern luxury expectations.

In addition to safety concerns -- ""making sure our bubbles would be elephant proof"" -- he says they had to meet very high standards.

""As a top notch resort, we had to ensure the experience would be very luxurious and to the level of what is expected by our guests,"" he explains.

Once the bubbles were set up, Harang was the first to trial them.

""Being in the north of Thailand, we are lucky to have a climate that's more varied than in the rest of the country,"" he says. ""Though short, we go through a winter season that is very cold. When the bubbles were finally ready [in December] it was 6 degrees Celsius in the morning and...well I froze!

""There was no heater. Also, being located in the jungle there is a lot of humidity so the bubbles were very wet at night due to all the condensation. So, I woke up at 3 a.m., soaked and cold.""

As a result, the bubbles are now equipped with an air conditioner, space heater and dehumidifier to ensure a comfortable climate for all seasons.

""When I finally saw the bubbles in place I was so happy it all worked out, but I think I was only really impressed when I slept in it the second time [after the climate issues were sorted],"" he recalls, telling CNN Travel it was truly a ""wow"" moment.

""When you finally live it, you see it's really a fantastic experience. We couldn't have planned it better.""

The right elephants for the job

Picking the right elephants for the Jungle Bubbles experience was another logistical issue that needed to be sorted, says John Roberts, Anantara's Director of Elephants.

Besides size considerations -- how many elephants could comfortably live on the available plot of land? -- they also had to decide which of the camp's elephants would enjoy being together in the enclosure. Turns out, even elephants can get into tiffs with their friends -- just like humans but with an additional 3.5 tonnes of weight to throw around.

The three elephants in the Jungle Bubbles enclosure all arrived at the resort between 2006-2010, so Roberts and his team already had ample time to get familiar with their temperaments.

""We watched them for a long time,"" says Roberts. ""We know that they like being together -- actually [two of them] are pretty much inseparable at this stage and if you try and separate them they get pretty stressed.""

Offering a better life to captive elephants

The resort, located in Chiang Saen, overlooks Myanmar and Laos. Etienne de Villiers

Anantara's nonprofit Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation (GTAEF), founded in 2006 and overseen by Roberts, cares for about two dozen elephants.

Most of the animals have led hard lives -- some spent their days walking the streets of Bangkok with their owners, making money begging from tourists. Others came from tourist trekking camps.

The way the program works is the foundation invites mahouts (elephant trainers/owners) and their families to move to Chiang Rai with their elephants and live in the foundation's camp.

The foundation offers them a wage, which includes the cost of care for their elephants. This amounts to about $18,000 per elephant per year.

Roberts acknowledges that in a perfect world all elephants would be roaming free in the wild but the situation is incredibly complex.

""Unfortunately, you can't release elephants in Thailand,"" he says, rattling off a long list of complications including fears of disease transmission, potential conflict in a fragile wild herd and an inability for domesticated elephants to fend for themselves given they've spent most if not all of their lives in captivity. And then there are Thailand's laws, which would also need to be changed.

Thailand's domesticated elephants are all registered under the Draft Animals Act, so ""if you put a captive elephant in a national park you're officially illegally grazing your livestock and that's the law as it is,"" says Roberts.

As an alternative, the GTAEF aims to improve the welfare of captive elephants through various programs not just at its resort but throughout the region -- including mahout training -- while also taking part in conservation and wild elephant programs.

At the resort's elephant camp, this means figuring out the elephants' personalities though science and observation and matching them with activities that suit them -- an essential part of their well-being. For instance, elephants that are comfortable around strangers take part in the peaceful ""Walking with Giants"" experience.

""In the wild their entire lives are based around walking long distances and finding food,"" says Roberts. ""They have big brains, you have to keep them stimulated doing different things. You could just put them out there in a field, but they'll stand in one spot all day.""

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

A Chilean island resident was arrested on March 1 after his truck -- a private vehicle, not a commercial one -- crashed into one of the stone figures and badly damaged both it and the ahu, or platform, it was perched on.

Local authorities believe that the accident was caused by brake failure that caused his truck to slide downhill.

On the island, which is known as Hanga Roa by its native Rapa Nui people, the enormous stone heads called moai have long been a source of intrigue and wonder.

""The damage is incalculable,"" Camilo Rapu, president of Easter Island's indigenous Rapa Nui community, told CNN in a statement.

The island's mayor, Pedro Pablo Petero Edmunds Paoa, is calling for stricter regulations that will prohibit vehicles from driving near the 1,000-odd moai on the UNESCO World Heritage-listed island.

Edmunds Paoa tried to pass an anti-driving measure eight years ago, he told Chilean newspaper El Mercurio de Valparaíso , with no effect. He believes that this week's accident could be the motivating factor to consider re-introducing the proposal.

""The Moai are sacred structures of religious value for the Rapa Nui people,"" Rapu said. ""Furthermore, [the damage of the moai] is an offense to a culture that has lived many years struggling to recover its heritage and archaeology.""

Easter Island, a Polynesian island that is a territory of Chile, has long struggled to balance its status as a bucket list travel destination with the local Rapa Nui people's desire to protect their heritage.

If it weren't for the mask on his face, Gennaro Arma, striding purposefully along the dockside in full uniform with hat under arm, might easily have been stepping down from an uneventful trip shuttling passengers from one vacation destination to another.

But those who know him best say the steadfast calm Arma exhibited throughout the ordeal in which more than 700 people on board the ship tested positive for COVID-19 was typical.

It's why, they say, the experienced Italian sailor is now being hailed as a hero at home and abroad.

""He emerged to be exactly how people have renamed him -- 'Fearless',"" Arma's wife, Mariana Gargiulo, tells CNN Travel from her home in Sant'Agnello, a beautiful coastal town south of Naples, where the captain is due to return soon.

""He never had any problems, and I never worried because we were constantly in contact.""

The quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess has been widely criticized for intensifying the risk of infection for those stuck aboard. Many passengers were eventually airlifted out, but not before at least five people had contracted fatal infections.

Nevertheless, Arma apparently proved himself a tireless rock for his passengers and crew during their ordeal and he's been widely praised for helping lift spirits and for setting a noble example of how a captain should deal with adversity.

His support for his crew was on display right to the end when he disembarked on March 2, having overseen the final transfer of all passengers either to hospital or a quarantine facility.

He called them ""my gladiators.""

Throughout the quarantine, he also regularly thanked all passengers on board for their patience and perseverance, leaving them notes of encouragement.

Back in Sant'Agnello his friends, family, townsfolk and local authorities are waiting for Arma's return, preparing to throw him a huge homecoming party. The captain tested negative for the virus and is currently in quarantine in Japan.

His wife says the captain's calm and control during the emergency made it easier for passengers to endure being confined to their cabins. It also gave his family a sense of peace and reassurance.

""We talked each day, both by phone and video chat,"" she says. ""I could hear he was calm, that everything was fine, and I could see that he was fine. He never had any problems.

""I could see him on the ship, he was doing well, working. We had the chance to talk a bit about everything, even our family, and not just about the situation on board.""

Arma, according to Gargiulo, is a real sea dog with decades of expertise that led him to travel around the world after he graduated at a prestigious local maritime school.

""He is a man with great sea skills and know-how,"" she adds. ""His main worry has always been the well-being of his passengers. It was a good test.""

As the wife of a cruise liner captain, Gargiulo has come to share and support her husband's job. She says she's ""always been very serene"" even during the past critical weeks.

She added that Arma was ""courageous, sympathetic and carried himself with dignity and optimism for what was an unprecedented and unique situation.

Passengers were thankful for the Valentine gifts and food, posting photos online of what Arma's crew provided them with.

At one point, Arma recited a quote from the Bible to guests on the power of love, taken from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians, to lift spirits and send out a message of faith and resilience.

It's not just those who endured the drama on board who have praised the captain.

His actions have resonated worldwide, especially in Italy where many people have seen him as embodying Italian endurance and the spirit of sacrifice. They've turned to social media to express gratitude and feelings in phrases such as "" proud to be Italian . Grazie!""

Another admirer says he should be ""a mandatory case history for talkative, braggart and cowardly politicians.""

Some closures are more memorable than others, such as Pan Am's fall from grace and the recent collapse of Thomas Cook, but each of these 17 airlines managed to make an impression on the industry, and on their passengers, before flying their final flights.

Flybe

UK airline Flybe went into administration March 4 , after a slump in bookings due to the novel coronavirus outbreak proved the nail in the coffin for the struggling carrier.

The low-budget airline celebrated its 40th anniversary last year and was Europe's largest independent regional airline, at one point operating more than 200 routes.

The UK government announced in January that it was in talks with the ailing carrier ""to set Flybe on a recovery path.""

However, the coronavirus outbreak in Europe meant the airline fell victim to a drop in demand for plane travel which has thrown the industry into crisis worldwide, with flights being canceled, planes grounded and airline staff across the globe forced to take unpaid leave.

British tour operator Thomas Cook, a venerable institution of 178 years' standing, collapsed in September 2019, stranding hundreds of thousands of travelers and triggering a huge repatriation effort.

Cook's increasingly old-fashioned model of selling package deals of flights on its own airlines, along with hotel rooms, from brick-and-mortar stores meant it had been struggling to compete with online rivals and low-budget upstarts.

Uncertainty over Brexit and a weak pound were also cited as contributor factors to the operator's struggles.

The airline section of the business operated with more than 100 aircraft, based in the UK, Denmark and Germany.

In March 2019, Iceland-based Wow Air, known for its wow-ingly low-priced flights between Europe and North America, abruptly shuttered and announced it was bankrupt.

""Wow had been in financial trouble, they had attempted to merge with Icelandair which failed,"" says CNN's Richard Quest. ""The writing was on the wall but Wow just continued to let people book.""

When the hoped-for merger with Icelandair fell apart at the last minute, it resulted in stranded passengers throughout Europe.

Although Wow's bright purple liveries and charismatic CEO Skuli Mogensen got plenty of buzz during its eight-year tenure, the airline might be best remembered for its spectacular demise.

US Airways

Founded in 1937 as ""All American Aviation,"" the airline rebranded to ""Allegheny Airlines"" in 1953, to ""USAir"" in 1979, when it was considered among the world's largest airlines, and finally to ""US Airways"" in 1997.

As US Airways, the carrier flew a wide domestic and international network from its hubs at Charlotte, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Washington D.C.-National airports, and bought up Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), Piedmont Airlines, and the failing Trump Shuttle.

On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 landed on the Hudson River following engine failure from multiple bird strikes. All passengers and crew survived in the event, now termed the ""Miracle on the Hudson.""

US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2013, forming the world's largest airline, with the final US Airways-branded flight landed in April 2015.

Continental's long history began in 1937 when ""Varney Speed Lines"" rebranded and refocused, from flying airmail to carrying passengers.

The airline was responsible for many historic ""firsts,"" such as hiring the first African-American pilot to work for any major US carrier (1963), inaugurating the first regular jet routes connecting islands across the Pacific (1968), flying the first non-stop route over 16 hours (Newark to Hong Kong, 2001) and offering 24-hour online support (2009).

Headquartered in Houston and with other hubs in Cleveland, Newark and Guam, Continental flew until it merged with United Airlines in 2012.

Midwest Airlines

This airline, founded in 1984 and with routes across the country chiefly from its Milwaukee and Kansas City hubs, ceased to exist in late 2010 when it merged into Frontier Airlines.

From the 1990s into the early 2000s, Midwest set itself apart from competitors by continuing to offer generous, complimentary hot meals when other airlines were cutting back on amenities.

Midwest's famous warm chocolate chip cookies, baked and served onboard every flight, outlasted the Midwest brand and continued on Frontier flights until that airline discontinued the cookie service in 2012.

ATA Airlines

Initially launching as charter company in 1973, ATA began scheduled operations in 1986 with flights from the Midwest to Florida, serving vacation routes that would ultimately become the airline's specialty despite a brief experiment with international flights.

Indianapolis and Chicago-Midway Airports served as ATA hubs. Following the economic effects of September 11, 2001, the airline suffered financial setback after setback, until declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations on April 2, 2008, with flights still in the air.

During the bankruptcy, Southwest Airlines scooped up the ATA brand, its access at LaGuardia Airport, and the operating certificate for $7.5 million.

TWA

A remnant of the glory days of Trans World Airlines remains at New York's JFK Airport, the airline's transatlantic hub, where passengers departed and arrived through the Eero Saarinen-designed ""TWA Flight Center"" terminal.

Aloha Airlines

The end of World War II and the purchase of a military surplus plane led to the 1946 creation of Aloha Airlines, which operated flights between the US mainland and Hawaii, and to other Pacific islands.

Aloha was the main competitor to Hawaiian Airlines, but it was a fare war with the now-defunct island-hopper airline ""go!"" that drove Aloha to declare bankruptcy and cease operations in 2008.

Transcend Air has plans for a jet-fast plane that takes off and lands vertically, allowing it to skip the crowded runway and land in city waterways.

Kingfisher Airlines

Travelers to India may be familiar with the Kingfisher brand of beer, but the name (and the beer's parent company) also entered the airline business, with Kingfisher Airlines commencing flights around India in 2005.

Its international service, to London, featured a bar in first class, and top-of-the-line entertainment systems and full-size pillows even in economy.

Consistent heavy financial losses drove Kingfisher to the brink of cessation several times, before the airline was forced to end operations in 2012 when India suspended its license and froze its accounts for non-payment of taxes.

Eos Airlines

The short-lived Eos Airlines, which existed only from 2004 to 2008, was an all-business-class carrier flying 48-seat Boeing 757s between New York-JFK and London's Stansted Airport.

It was a trend leader, heralding the slew of all-premium transatlantic airlines that also started up in the mid-2000s, like L'Avion, MAXJet and Silverjet. Before Eos could see through its plans to expand all-business-class flights to other US, European, and even South American destinations, the airline suddenly collapsed into bankruptcy.

Primera Air

Primera may have hit the headlines for its spectacularly terrible failure and stranding thousands of passengers (and even its own crew) when it ceased operations in October 2018 without warning, but the airline had been around since 2003 and was a successful charter operation before it pivoted to ultra-low-cost scheduled flights primarily on European holiday routes.

Primera's attempt to offer long-haul, transatlantic flights between the United States and Europe then literally got off the ground in April 2018, only to last a few months before the entire operation collapsed two years ago.

Monarch Airlines

Primera's failure came on the one-year anniversary of Monarch Airlines' own demise, which occurred on October 2, 2017.

The budget British airline, founded in 1967, flew vacationers to tourism hotspots around Europe, as well as to Israel.

Financial difficulties drove Monarch to desperately seek funding and, despite scoring some investment from Boeing in 2016, the airline shut down and stranded some 110,000 passengers who were later repatriated on other airlines in an operation costing £60 million ($78 million).

Air Berlin

Founded by Americans in 1978, Air Berlin initially operated holiday charter flights from West Berlin to Mediterranean vacation destinations. German reunification saw the airline rapidly expand, and Air Berlin became one of the largest European carriers.

Future plans and expansion hinged on eventually basing operations at Berlin's new Brandenburg Airport, which was originally due to open in 2011 but suffered rolling delays and is now not expected to open, if at all, until 2020.

Air Berlin scaled back on operations over several years and, with sustained financial losses, finally flew its final flight in October 2017. Nearly immediately Lufthansa swooped in and purchased 81 of its aircraft and employed more than 3,000 former Air Berlin employees, with Easyjet also taking a smaller piece of the Air Berlin pie.

Pan Am

The Pan Am Experience restaurant takes ""passengers"" back to the airline's '70s heyday complete with a four-course meal.

Pan Am, short for Pan American World Airways, is the story of a tiny, airmail carrier that hopped from Florida to Cuba and back beginning in 1927, to become the world's largest airline and an industry innovator until its demise in 1991.

Graduating from floatplanes to Boeing 747s, the airline pioneered flight routes, opened hotels (starting the InterContinental hotel chain), and symbolized the glamor of the jet age.

Oil crises, hijackings and attacks, and other operational setbacks forced Pan Am into dire financial straits, and the carrier ceased on December 4, 1991. Delta paid $1.39 billion to acquire Pan Am's assets, also honoring passenger tickets on the bankrupt carrier.

Ted

When low-cost airline literally and figuratively took off in the United States in the mid-2000s, United felt the pressure to try its own hand and thus formed Ted. The airline began flying all-economy Airbus A320s in 2004, with a hub at Denver International Airport.

In-flight entertainment on Ted flights was limited to ""Tedevision"" and ""TedTunes,"" and the airline sold teddy bears onboard. Ted's main competitors were Frontier Airlines and Delta's similar low-cost experiment, Song, and it lasted until 2009 when operations were folded back into United.

['Francesca Street'],What airlines are doing to sanitize planes,"But airplanes are still flying, and travelers still traveling, albeit with extra bottles of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in carry-ons.

Still, as you board the aircraft and sit in your seat, you might find yourself reconsidering inflight hygiene -- and wondering just how thoroughly the aircraft's actually been cleaned before you boarded.

CNN Travel spoke to airlines, airplane companies and medical experts to find out what's been done to ensure you're flying in as hygienic an environment as possible, and what passengers can do for extra reassurance.

Normal cleaning procedure

Christian Rooney is the manager of JetWash Aero, a specialist aviation cleaning company based in the UK that's tasked with turning around aircraft between flights.

Rooney tells CNN Travel that the cleaning process varies depending on the schedule of the aircraft in question.

When aircraft downtime is very limited, some of what Rooney calls the ""very straightforward cleaning,"" such as removing old newspapers and passenger trash, will be done by the cabin crew at the end of the previous flight.

""A basic but more thorough cabin clean is usually carried out at night -- or when there is more downtime -- and it includes the cleaning of toilets, wiping down and disinfecting of trays, cleaning galleys, [overhead bins], seats etc. This may take up to an hour or longer,"" explains Rooney.

""An airline will also always schedule a 'deep interior clean' every month or six weeks. This clean takes several hours and is extremely thorough.""

Cleaning products and disinfectants are approved by aircraft manufacturers, says Rooney.

""Some of the disinfectants we use are effective against a wide range of pathogens and are known to inactivate complex viruses with similar properties to SARS, E. coli, avian flu, MRSA etc,"" he adds.

These offer antimicrobial protection for up to 10 days, he says.

Stephanie Biron, a recently retired flight attendant who used to work for American Airlines, tells CNN Travel that, in her experience, standards of aircraft cleaning would vary.

""A lot of times you come on and it's not terribly satisfactory, but you have to rely on the individuals doing their jobs, because that's what they've been paid to do,"" she says.

""Sometimes you come on and you have to go out and tell the agent, 'look, the plane looks terrible. We need somebody to come on and redo it.' It just varies all the time. Sometimes you come on in the morning and they deep cleaned the whole thing, or at least they told you they have.""

Passenger personal hygiene

Some airlines have requested additional measures due to the current climate, says Rooney.

""We have seen an uptick in the requirements and levels of disinfection, spraying and fumigation of the cabin, as the airlines look to address concerns over the coronavirus,"" he explains.

But Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, says that he doesn't think there's much more carriers can do to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Because transmission most often occurs person to person, the inanimate environment of the airplane isn't really the problem, says Schaffner.

It's still wise, he says, to wipe down surfaces -- but ultimately it's handwashing that is the most important preventative step.

""Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle. You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth,"" Schaffner explains.

""So it's those hands we have that are the important intermediary -- and that's where I would put the emphasis. Use those wipes on your hands. That's the important thing.""

Dr Paulo Alves, who is currently attending IATA's Aviation Resilience Health workshop in Singapore -- which is working to address the overall impact of COVID-19 -- agrees with Schaffner.

""The most effective, simple measure vacationers should implement is to wash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer should be used,"" says Alves.

""It seems reasonable to wipe the tray table surface, where it is more likely for droplets to land after someone coughs or sneezes. Travelers should maintain good personal hygiene on board flights, before flights and after flights and avoid touching their face.""

Travel medicine specialist Richard Dawood agrees, and says this advice stretches to navigating airports too. ""Remain aware of where your hands have been,"" he says.

Former flight attendant Biron also expresses concern not just for passengers -- but for air crew. They're just as likely to get sick, she points out, or feel pressured to still fly while unwell.

Airlines for America, the aviation group that represents North American carriers, says airlines are working closely with federal authorities -- and tells CNN Travel that the safety and security of passengers and crew ""is -- and always will be -- the top priority of US carriers.""

""I really don't think [airlines] can do very much. They might make the wipes more available to individuals,"" says Schaffner.

Airline response

Aircraft are cleaned on the ground, between flights. Spencer Platt/Getty Images

So what are airlines doing differently right now?

Brian Parrish, spokesman for Southwest Airlines, tells CNN Travel that Southwest aircraft undergo ""regular cleanings between flights and a comprehensive cleaning when aircraft are parked overnight.""

""Our cleaning program includes the disinfecting of all hard surfaces within the cabin, as well as seat and carpet cleaning,"" he says. ""Southwest will continue to monitor and follow all guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization regarding the coronavirus and make any adjustments to our procedures, as necessary.""

Curtis Blessing, an American Airlines spokesperson, echos Parrish.

""Our aircraft, including lavatories, are cleaned on a regular basis, and the depth of the cleaning varies depending on turn times and type of flying,"" he says. ""Lavatories are cleaned, floors are spot cleaned and visible trash is removed from seat pockets on all flights.""

Transcontinental, Hawaii and international flights see a deeper level of cleaning, Blessing adds.

Meanwhile, a Qantas spokesperson tells CNN Travel that the airline adopts ""the highest standard in cleaning and disinfecting our cabins, seats, galleys and washrooms.""

The spokesperson also highlights the HEPA filters which are part of the air conditioning system. ""These filters are used in hospital operating theaters, with air in the cabin replaced every three to five minutes. This provides much cleaner air than other public spaces like trains, restaurants, shopping centers and offices.""

This echoes the official advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that, due to the way air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, ""most viruses and other germs do not spread easily,"" but that travelers are still advised to ""avoid contact with sick passengers and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol.""

Delta says on its website that it's been deploying a ""fogging technique"" since February, using ""a highly effective, EPA-registered disinfectant.""

Fogging is being used on all trans-Pacific Delta flights arriving into the US, with plans to expand those procedures to more inbound international flights, focusing on flights coming from places with reported coronavirus cases. Fogging has been taking place on all inbound Delta flights from Italy to New York-JFK and Atlanta since February 29.

Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific tells CNN Travel that aircraft cabin cleaning is always carried out to ""high standards"" -- but some extra precautions are currently in place.

""Out of an abundance of caution, aircraft will be taken out of service to perform extensive additional deep cleaning and supplementary disinfection when a confirmed case of coronavirus has been identified,"" says a Cathay Pacific spokesperson.

""This includes the replacement of all seat covers, disinfection of all surfaces and galley equipment, detailed cleaning of the lavatories, disinfection of carpets, sterilization of the water system and replacement of air filters in addition to standard cleaning procedures.""

Cathay Pacific has also temporarily suspended hot towels, pillows, blankets, magazines and in-flight duty-free on flights to and from destinations in mainland China.

Still, Schaffner says panicked passengers shouldn't feel they need to avoid using in-flight blankets or pillows if they are provided on their flight. There's ""no good data"" to support the idea they're responsible for transmission, he says.

""It's a consideration that comes logically to the mind, but it's difficult to convince people that they're really low risk. I always come back to the intermediate vehicle [which is] your hands. Do a lot of good hand-sanitizing.""

Alves agrees, pointing out that viruses will be eliminated when blankets and pillows are washed. However, he does clarify that there are ""knowledge gaps"" about the COVID-19 virus and research is ongoing, so recommendations may change.

Staying vigilant

So if you're boarding a flight soon, stocking up on hand sanitizer is the best move. Is there anything else to be done?

Schaffner notes that, from the passengers' point of view, the ultimate way to avoid infections on aircraft is to stay home.

""And there will come a time perhaps -- and some of that is happening already -- where we are being urged to social distance ourselves,"" he says. ""People are reconsidering whether they wish to fly at the moment.""

Grinning vacantly, he leans against a wall emblazoned with a quote from Franz Kafka: ""There is an infinite amount of hope in the universe ... but not for us.""

The quirky addition to Taipei's bar scene serves up creative cocktails, black humor and a dislike of humankind.

Its cocktails sound bleak: ""Ghost Island Tea"" has Taiwanese Spring Vodka and Kavalan Whisky, plus dashes of tequila, kahlua, vermouth and lemon juice; ""Kafkaesque"" blends together ""Kaffe und Wodka"" and other spirits with root beer.

A mix of Midori, sake-based Mikanshu, cherry brandy and Absolut Vodka comes up with ""No Longer Human.""

The cocktails have names like ""Ghost Island Tea"" and ""Last Words."" courtesy The Misanthrope Society

If you order the gin-based ""Last Words,"" you are politely asked to write down what you will say on your deathbed to add to a pile of cards in the bar. ""Stay ridiculous,"" reads one.

The bar itself is characterized by dark humor and dark décor: black walls, a black menu, black plates -- even the fried chicken is black, after being marinated in traditional Taiwanese fermented bean curd, splashed with alcohol and set alight.

Diners are left to watch flames shooting out of what looks like black remains, a fried chicken dish that evokes the image of hell.

As if you didn't get the message, ""Hell is other people,"" the famous quote from Jean-Paul Sartre, is painted on a wall.

""You can hate this world as much as you want""

The anti-social theme of the bar belies its inclusiveness; the owner, who has suffered from severe depression, wanted to provide a space that was welcoming to others in need.

""We call it 'The Misanthrope Society,' which literally means you can hate this world as much as you want here,"" says Chen Xiaoguai.

""I want to attract people with the dark side,"" so they can then help each other and experience ""the warmth from different people,"" he adds.

""The Misanthrope Society"" is located in one of Taipei's most happening districts, bang in the middle of a bustling night market selling clothes and snacks, and less than a minute's walk from the Gongguan metro station.

But owner Chen has managed to find a space that is perfect for a bar that professes to hate human society, in a dark corner of a road that leads nowhere, where no sunshine reaches.

Inside, though, is some hidden human warmth.

Chen was inspired to open the bar after spending a month in a mental health hospital.

There he received specialist care from psychologists and other health professionals, but felt like the system stopped providing support after he was discharged.

""I think the most important thing in my case in stepping out from the dark side is the help from people, the friends I met in hospital,"" says Chen, who used to be an engineer.

""I want to replicate this peer support group.""

However, many people with depression choose not to drink alcohol because it makes their symptoms worse or mixes badly with their medication.

At The Misanthrope Society, you can get that sense of community without the booze, as the bar is also a coffee shop and bookstore, offering psychology books, autobiographies and novels about dark episodes in people's lives. Books lined up on a coffee bar include ""The Museum of Broken Relationships"" and ""Poetry About How Much I Hate My Life.""

Since opening the space in February last year, Chen says people ""came here to cry, to talk to me, to just stay, read my books.""

More than a dozen regulars who experience similar mental health issues have got to know each other and formed their own support network.

In Taiwan, mental health is not talked about much and is often still misunderstood and stigmatized.

""Before, these people probably can only talk to their family, their friends, who can't really understand them, especially our parents, the older generations, who have no idea or knowledge of mental health problems,"" says Chen, 28.

Older generations might suggest problems can be solved by talking to a temple official, or through superstition.

""The Misanthrope Society"" offers an outlet for all drinkers and diners to express their mood, and that starts with what you order.

The ""furiously stewed"" duck may appeal to those feeling angry, while the Scotch egg's Chinese name translates as ""withdraw into one's shell.""

Chen was once asked to create a cocktail for ""the feeling of being enslaved by society."" He created one ""opaque in color, strong in flavor.""

['Andrea Lo'],Luxembourg makes all public transport free,"(CNN) — With a population of 602,000 , Luxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries -- yet it suffers from major traffic jams.

But that could be about to change. As of March 1, 2020 all public transport -- trains, trams and buses -- in the country is now free.

The government hopes the move will alleviate heavy congestion and bring environmental benefits, according to Dany Frank, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mobility and Public Works.

Tiny country, big traffic

Landlocked Luxembourg is one of the richest countries in Europe, with the highest per capita GDP in the European Union

High housing costs, especially in Luxembourg City, mean more than 180,000 of its workforce commute from those neighboring countries every day.

""Luxembourg is a very attractive place for jobs,"" explains Geoffrey Caruso, a professor at the University of Luxembourg and the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research specializing in land use and transportation.

Park and rides around Luxembourg's borders in the three neighboring countries, however, will encourage commuters to use free mass transit, according to Frank.

Free transport for all

Luxembourg's public transport system covers the whole country and costs $562 million (€508 million) per year to run. Each year, it generates around $46 million in ticket sales, according to the ministry.

The government is putting up the cost of making it free, Frank says. ""The country at this very moment is in really good shape. We, the government, want the people to benefit from the good economy.""

Caruso is concerned that making transport free may unintentionally deter people who would normally walk or cycle in urban areas. ""Rather than walking 500 meters, you see a bus coming and you say, 'I (can) get on and travel 500 meters because it's free,'"" he says.

['Alec Snyder'],National Museum of American Jewish History files for bankruptcy,"(CNN) The National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to court documents.

The museum -- which was founded in 1976 and is a Smithsonian affiliate -- announced it will continue operating while undergoing reorganization, according to a news release issued Monday.

""The future is only likely to get better and brighter,"" interim CEO Misha Galperin told CNN on Monday. ""It's a very important, historic place where the nation was born and we're here to tell the nation what American Jews are grateful for, what was done for us in America and what we in turn contributed to the United States.""

Galperin said most of the museum's $30 million in debt stems from loans the museum took out to fund the construction of its new building on Independence Mall between 2008 -- at the height of the economic recession -- and 2010, when the building was completed. Outside funding levels declined sharply due to the recession, necessitating the loans, officials said.

""[Funding] didn't return until the levels of pre-2008 until about a year ago,"" Galperin said. ""In order to finish construction, the museum had to borrow money and we were hopeful we could repay the money. We never could.""

['Lilit Marcus'],Are fat fliers being discriminated against by airlines?,"(CNN) — Earlier this year, a family of three women from New Zealand -- a mom and her two adult daughters -- made headlines around the world when they were denied the business class seats they'd paid for on a Thai Airways flight because they were too big to fit into them.

Ironically, the family -- Huhana Iripa and daughters Tere and Renell -- had purchased business class seats because they'd assumed those would be bigger and more comfortable.

But because Thai Airways' plane seat models made it impossible to put seatbelt extenders onto business class seats, the three women were moved into coach class and given seatbelt extenders.

While the Iripas' story went viral and resulted in a refund from the airline for the difference in cost between the business seats they'd paid for and the coach ones they ended up flying in, stories like these are not anomalies.

As airplane seats continue to shrink, more and more people around the world find themselves unable to fit -- or else subject to invasive comments, touches and other humiliations by both airline employees and their fellow passengers.

Adding to the challenges, there is no universal standard in seat sizing for the airline industry. Every airline has different guidelines, meaning that even the best-informed consumers have trouble keeping up.

But there are ways to make flying -- which can be anxiety-producing for even the most mainstream traveler -- more humane for everyone on board, no matter what their body looks like.

The goalposts are moving

Annette Richmond is a body-positive activist and the founder of Fat Girls Traveling , a digital community that provides women with support, advice and resources about traveling with different body types.

As a self-described ""digital nomad"" with no official address, she has clocked thousands of hours in the sky and has dealt with a range of situations on board. She's also plus size herself.

Though her own number-one piece of advice is to do as much research as possible about your flight, carrier and seat ahead of time, she admits this can be challenging. The rules are frequently changing and not always posted in an easy-to-find place.

Related content What we resolve not to do on a plane in 2020

""(Airlines) intentionally make it difficult and make sure it takes time and money and effort for you to travel comfortably as a fat person, because they're there to make a profit,"" Richmond says.

Some countries have specific regulations about body size and air travel rights. For example, travelers flying on domestic flights within Canada who need two seats can get the cost of the second seat refunded if they have a doctor's note.

In Australia, the Australian Consumer Law prohibits airlines from charging passengers different amounts based on their body sizes.

Colorado-based startup Molon Labe Seating is developing a staggered seating design for commercial airlines which they claim provides passengers with more room and larger seats.

But in the United States, it's a gray area.

AirHelp.com is a US-based website that helps consumers take action against airlines in situations like these.

The company's chief legal officer, Christian Nielsen, says that passengers who have had negative interactions with airlines regarding seat size have to deal with regulations that change constantly or are difficult to articulate.

""There are not many laws to protect people who do not fit into shrinking airline seats,"" Nielsen tells CNN. ""There is no law currently in place (in the United States) to protect passengers who are bumped from their flight due to their size.""

When Lauren Haber Jonas founded Part + Parcel , a community platform and online retailer for plus size women, she was determined to make sure her company's values for her employees matched the ones they were instilling for their customers.

She vowed that any Part + Parcel employee on a work trip would be accommodated in their seat and travel preferences -- whether that means two seats, using extenders or anything else that a person of size would prefer to make flying more comfortable.

But she found that it was hard to know what the guidelines were in order to follow them.

""It's a disaster,"" she admits. ""Every airline has different configurations and policies, but every airplane has different seats. The age and the model of the plane, and if the model has been remodeled, and and and. I have found myself spending many hours looking at widths and dimensions of first class versus business class versus coach on every plane you can possibly imagine.""

It's not just about the seat

One thing is for sure: conversations around body size and airplane seat sizes aren't going away.

In December 2019, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine predicted that half of Americans will be obese by the year 2030, with one in four having a body mass index (BMI) of over 35.

But while bigger bodies are everywhere, that doesn't mean that social attitudes have changed.

""I feel like when you live your life in a marginalized body, a fat body or a disabled body or an older body, something that's outside of the generalized norm, you get used to being othered all the time and you have to walk through the world with an additional armor,"" says Richmond.

The term ""microaggressions"" is used to explain how little slights that might otherwise not seem like a big deal accumulate over time to turn into an issue.

For plus-size people, it's not just about one particular seat on one particular airplane.

Despite being an activist, Richmond can often get so worn down by the nonstop questions and comments -- from cabin crew, from fellow passengers, and even from total strangers -- that she just gives in.

Related content 9 things that will make flying on an airplane better

In one case, when she says was asked by a crew member to move out of an exit row seat despite being able to fit safely into the seatbelt, she just said yes to avoid a conflict and because she didn't want to have to ""prove"" her body was an acceptable size.

Richmond feels that the reason there hasn't been a significant movement to make travel more comfortable for people with larger bodies is because we live in a society that considers fatness a moral failing and something that doesn't deserve sympathy.

On the other side, for example, it's considered a positive trait to be tall -- so tall passengers who complain about lack of leg room are seen as having a more valid complaint.

""There are statistics all the time that say that 80 percent of people (in the United States) hate plus size people,"" says Haber Jonas. ""In being a plus size person, it's the sense that you did this to yourself. You made yourself fat, you created this body, it's imposing on me and it's your job to make yourself smaller.""

And tensions that could be resolved easily on the ground become urgent issues in the air, when there's no way for people to get away from each other and avoid sharing space.

Being stuck in a flying tube together often can turn a mildly uncomfortable situation into a crisis.

l e v a r t

""The fact that [air travel] gets worse and worse over time means that people are more and more pissed off. You enter the experience unhappy -- there are no plugs at the gate, the boarding experience is miserable, it's no wonder that you get upset. If you get upset about a person of size, it's about how it affects you and your life and your day, you don't think outside of yourself.""

Ultimately, it's much easier to get annoyed at a fellow passenger instead of pulling back and thinking about the structural issues in the aviation industry affect all travelers.

After all, you can't yell at a structural issue.

What happens next?

Unless there's a huge transformation of the airline industry, seat sizes and configurations aren't likely to change soon.

The time and cost involved in building aircraft mean that changes happen gradually, sometimes over years. And in-flight comfort is often sacrificed at the altar of the lowest fare.

For those in cattle class, enlisting a high-profile ally can often be a support.

In 2010, ""Clerks"" director Kevin Smith was removed from a Southwest Airways flight to Burbank because a crew member said he needed an additional seat.

Smith went on a rant against the airline, which he posted in a series of tweets.

""Dude, I know I'm fat,"" he said at the time. ""That's not why I was truly thrown off that plane, because I fit perfectly in the seat ... I am not fat enough to eject off a Southwest flight.""

Later, Southwest changed its policy, citing Smith's experience as part of their reason why. And, six years later, he flew the airline again with no issues.

Richmond also advocates for the power of community. Often, if a member of Fat Girls Traveling has had an issue with a specific airline or travel company, members will back each other up online.

NORTH ISLAND

Cape Reinga

Cape Reinga is the end of the road when it comes to the North Island -- the only place further north is North Cape, which isn't open to the public.

Stand beside the iconic Te Rerenga Wairua lighthouse on this rocky, windswept point and you'll see where the Tasman Sea (between New Zealand and Australia) and the Pacific Ocean meet.

You'll also be bearing witness to a sacred place in Maori culture. An 800-year-old pohutukawa tree at Cape Reinga is believed to be the last leaving place for spirits of dead Maori.

Legend has it that they leap from this tree into the ocean to begin their journey back to their ancestral homeland of Hawaiki.

Auckland

Auckland: New Zealand's biggest and most culturally diverse city. Chris McLennan/Tourism New Zealand

There's lots to see and do in New Zealand's biggest and most culturally diverse city.

The 'City of Sails' sprawls around more than 40 volcanic cones and is surrounded by the island-strewn Hauraki Gulf.

Auckland has a metropolitan vibe, but it's also blessed with bountiful beaches, parks and places to get away from it all.

When you need a break from the hustle and bustle, walk to the top of Maungakiekie (Mt Eden). Here, just 5km from the CBD, you will enjoy panoramic views from the city's highest volcanic cone while sheep graze peacefully nearby.

Bonus trip: Make sure you include a trip to Waiheke Island -- just 40 minutes from the terminal in Auckland -l- for a complete change of pace. Waiheke is home to idyllic beaches, bushwalking trails and 20-odd vineyards.

Lake Taupo + Tongariro National Park

A lake the size of Singapore? Check. Volcanoes? Check. Bubbling mud and steaming hot water pools? Check. Bleak, barren desert landscapes? Check.

Lake Taupo and its surrounding landscapes read like they've been purpose-built for a tourism brochure. The freshwater lake, which is the biggest in Australasia, is a vast caldera formed by a super-volcanic eruption some 26,000 years ago.

At the southern end, three mighty volcanoes (Mounts Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngaruahoe) loom large. It's no wonder that nearby Tongariro National Park (a World Heritage Area) was used as the backdrop for some of the most stunning scenes in the Lord of the Rings films.

Many visitors choose to base themselves in Taupo, the town on the lake's northern shores. There's no shortage of outdoor experiences on offer here, including fishing, mountain biking, skydiving, jet-boating and bungee jumping.

In winter months, all eyes are on the mountains. There are two fields on Mount Ruapehu (Whakapapa and Turoa) and plenty of apres-ski fun to be had in the small town of Ohakune.

Bonus trip: Get up close (okay, not too close!) with steaming mineral pools and bubbling mud at the Tokaanu Thermal Walk (near Turangi, 40 minutes from Taupo), then take a dip in the healing waters of the nearby geothermal hot pools to soothe away any travel-induced aches and pains.

Lake Waikaremoana + Te Urewera

Remote and rugged Te Urewera is the largest protected tract of native forest in the North Island: Think dense, rugged bush, vast Lake Waikaremoana (formed more than 2000 years ago by a monumental landslide) and lots of potential for fishing, tramping, camping and hunting.

It's home to the Ngati Tuhoe tribe (nicknamed 'the Children of the Mist') and most species of New Zealand's native birds. If you're looking for somewhere to completely switch off, this is it.

To exercise body as well as mind, consider hiking the complete Lake Waikaremoana Track.

This trail, one of New Zealand's 'Great Walks,' traces the western side of the lake and takes around four days. Expect giant podocarp forests, remote beaches and incredible views. There are plenty of shorter hikes if you're pressed for time.

If you're keen on 'kai moana' (seafood), Kaikoura also has a reputation for the island's best crayfish (local lobster) and other fresh fish.

A huge stretch of the eastern coastline of the upper south island around Kaikoura was uplifted in a 2018 earthquake, but the town recovered despite disruption to transport links and infrastructure.

It remains an unforgettable place to visit, with the mountains looming over long, deserted pebble beaches.

Punakaiki Pancake Rocks + Paparoa National Park

The Great Coast Road between Greymouth and Westport on the West Coast of the South Island was recently named one of the world's greatest drives by Lonely Planet.

This wild, practically uninhabited stretch of coastline has near-mythical status in New Zealand, thanks mostly to its varied and unspoiled geography, down-to-earth locals and rich history.

With the pounding waves of the Tasman Sea on one side and the tropical rainforest of the Paparoa National Park on the other, the drive between Greymouth and Westport is punctuated by the famous limestone formations and blowholes at Punakaiki.

['Hollie Silverman'],Travelers will face new restrictions and cancellations as coronavirus cases grow in the US,"(CNN) — Travelers entering the United States will face new protocols as cases of novel coronavirus grow around the world.

The US is expanding travel restrictions from Iran and heightening a travel advisory for certain regions of South Korea and Italy, Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday. Meantime, President Trump in a tweet on Sunday announced new screening procedures for people traveling from ""high-risk countries.""

New screening methods

There was already a ban on travel related to Iran, but the administration said Saturday that it is being expanded ""to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days."" As of Monday morning, there have been 978 cases of coronavirus in Iran and 54 deaths.

The US is also increasing the travel advisory for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level -- advising Americans not to travel to specific regions in those countries hit hardest by the virus, Pence announced through the State Department.

""Additionally we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy , and other European Nations as needed,"" Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence, told CNN Sunday when asked to clarify what Trump meant by ""high risk.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the goal is to lower the travel to and from the most impacted areas in an attempt to control the spread of the virus.

Screening is already in place for those traveling from China. Anyone who has been in China within the last 14 days requires screening.

Trump on Saturday warned Americans that although more cases are ""likely,"" most healthy people who contract the illness will recover and the risk to the average American remains low. And Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that while the administration knows there will be more cases and that it's possible Americans could die from the disease, ""the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low.""

Additional restrictive measures were announced in January and are scheduled to take effect starting at 5 p.m. ET on Monday. Those include that US citizens and permanent residents returning to the United States who have traveled to Iran within the previous 14 days must enter trough an approved airport. Foreign nationals who have traveled to Iran within the last 14 days will be denied permission to travel to the US.

['Joshua Mellin'],Japan's snow monkeys de-stress in hot springs,"(CNN) — The Japanese macaques in Jigokudani Monkey Park begin most days with a relaxing dip in their own private hot tub.

Located in Joshinetsu Kogen National Park in Japan's Nagano prefecture, the primate-only onsen is world-famous as the preferred simian hot spring.

But life hasn't always been so simple for the snow monkeys of Jigokudani (""The Valley of Hell,"" named for its natural hot springs). They were initially forced from their habitat in the 1950s by the development of nearby ski resorts.

As a result, they moved into nearby towns and quickly found trouble, raiding fruit from local farmers' orchards. The farmers petitioned the government and were granted the right to hunt the animals.

Legend has it, the manager of Kourakukan, a nearby ryokan (a traditional Japanese inn), began feeding the animals in 1957. Enlisting the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University, the inn's manager put the monkeys on the radar of researchers as well as a Nagano Railway Company worker and local nature enthusiast, Sogo Hara.

Hara and his group visited the ryokan, which included outdoor onsen for guests' enjoyment. One day in 1961, so the story goes, an errant apple fell into the human's onsen. A young monkey tested the steamy water and emerged with the apple. He didn't exit the waters immediately, though, and many of the monkeys looked on as their buddy quietly enjoyed the water.

l e v a r t

It wasn't long before other young monkeys began mimicking the water-loving monkey's behavior.

Within months, all of the female monkeys had taken to bathing in the hot springs.

This soon led to the establishment of the Jigokudani Monkey Park in 1964, thanks to the efforts of many invested parties. Today, this is where the snow monkeys live, freely soaking in their dedicated hot springs peacefully.

Damage resulting from Typhoon No. 19 had impacted the spring's water levels and temperature but restoration work is now underway and the park is open to tourists.

The Jigokudani Facebook page offers daily updates on the restoration work and presence of the monkeys.

A relaxing soak

The snow monkeys' onsen practice isn't solely about warming their bodies or bobbing for apples -- like the Japanese and visitors to Japan, they seem to appreciate onsen for its stress-reducing properties.

Since the macaque's thick coats keep them warm, and they take a dip even when there are no apples in sight, researchers' studying the monkeys at Jigokudani believe hot springs function primarily to ease their tension.

Staff encourage the macaques to keep the park's onsen in their daily routine, offering a steady diet of soybeans, barley and, of course, apples.

Researchers also discovered the monkeys' indifference to the nearly 500 daily visitors to the park. In other words, their stress hormones did not increase as the number of park visitors increased.

Even during the busy tourist season, the monkeys meander nonchalantly about the park, climbing in and out of the hot spring as humans snap photos and ooh and ahh in delight.

Unlike some of Japan's other open animal experiences, such as Nara Deer Park, touching or feeding the monkeys is strictly prohibited. But this rule doesn't detract from the joy of sitting poolside as the macaque play leapfrog.

Since the monkeys don't swim every day (in spite of their warm fur coats, they seem to prefer the hot springs on colder days), visitors will want to plan accordingly before heading north to the park.

A flexible itinerary is best, and January and February are prime visiting months. Fresh snow is ideal -- the monkeys are at home and perhaps at their playful best in the snowy climate. If you're lucky, you might even catch baby monkeys wrestling and making snowballs.

Time of day is a critical piece of planning, too: Jigokudani Monkey Park requires an overnight stay to catch the monkey's early morning soak. While it is possible to do it as a day trip from Tokyo, even catching the earliest train will make for a later arrival, when crowds are at their greatest, and that's if everything goes off without a hitch. If you miss seeing the monkeys, you'll wish you had allowed for more time.

The park opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. daily, with extended hours from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. seasonally.

You're better off arriving the night before you plan to visit. Stay at a ryokan, delight in its onsen and take off for the park first thing in the morning. If you can, leave time for onsen exploration beyond your ryokan, for at the base of the mountain leading to the park is a main street packed with nine unique onsens for weary travelers.

Each meant to aid a particular ailment, the onsen encourage visitors to walk the charming street in a yukata (light kimono) and wooden sandals to collect stamps on a towel passport from all the onsens. Doing so is believed to ward off evil spirits and bring divine favor. The thin strip contains no shortage of mom-and-pop restaurants eager to share their house-made versions of Japanese staples.

Getting there

Most of these inns offer complimentary morning shuttles to the Jigokudani Monkey Park's information center. To best even these crowds, early risers can trek up the scenic path themselves for a chance at some private time with the monkeys.

From the information center, the monkey's onsen is only accessible via a one-mile path through the forest, about 30 minutes each way. Unfortunately, Jigokudani Monkey Park is not accessible to wheelchairs as the final ascent consists of tight winding paths and steep steps.

Jigokudani Monkey Park's pool-side views offers visitors a delightful insight into this unique behavior. Relaxing with the chilled-out macaques is a quintessential excursion from Japan's mega-cities.

Getting to Jigokudani Monkey Park from Tokyo requires an hour and a half ride on the shinkansen (high speed train) to Nagano, then a 50-minute trip on a local train to Yudanaka station in Yamanouchi, the town the park is located in. The Jigokudani Monkey Park information center is two miles from the train station.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/QzlxoCHggi4/index.html,CNN,Travel,True

['Rob Picheta'],"Climate activists just blocked plans to expand Heathrow, one of the world's biggest airports","London (CNN) — The British government's contentious plans to build a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport have been blocked by an appeals court on environmental grounds, in a landmark victory for climate campaigners.

Judges in the closely-watched case at London's Court of Appeal said the UK government, which threw its support behind the proposal, had failed to take into account what impact the move would have on Britain's commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The decision could scupper plans to expand one of the world's busiest airports, and was celebrated on the court's steps on Thursday by a number of climate groups that had brought the legal action against the UK's Transport Secretary.

The court did not rule on the legality of a third runway itself, and Heathrow said it would appeal at the Supreme Court -- but the British government said it would not contest the verdict.

The ultimate decision over whether to fight for a third runway lies with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has long opposed the idea and once said he would ""lie down in front of the bulldozers"" to stop it going ahead.

""We have not found that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the United Kingdom's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change under the Paris Agreement, or with any other policy the Government may adopt or international obligation it may undertake,"" the judges wrote in their ruling.

""The Paris Agreement ought to have been taken into account by the Secretary of State... and an explanation given as to how it was taken into account, but it was not,"" they added.

The accord pushes signatories to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2C by the end of the century.

London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, had supported the legal action and welcomed the decision on Thursday. ""We won!"" Khan tweeted after the ruling. ""A new runway at Heathrow would have serious consequences on climate change, on air quality, on noise pollution, on road and rail networks and on the quality of life in our city,"" he added in a statement.

The move marks a new period of uncertainty in the lengthy and controversial debate over whether to build a third runway at the site -- which would have made Heathrow the world's busiest airport by current statistics.

After the verdict, the UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government will look elsewhere in exploring expansion and would not fight the decision.

""Airport expansion is core to boosting global connectivity. We also take seriously our commitment to the environment. This Govt won't appeal today's judgement given our manifesto makes clear any #Heathrow expansion will be industry led,"" he wrote on Twitter.

However, a statement from Heathrow Airport said the issue identified by the court is ""eminently fixable.""

""We will appeal to the Supreme Court on this one issue and are confident that we will be successful. In the meantime, we are ready to work with the Government to fix the issue that the court has raised,"" the airport's spokesperson said in a statement.

Lawmakers approved the proposal in 2018, but strong resistance from climate campaigners and those living near the site has loomed over the project.

The new airstrip would cross over the M25 motorway, London's busy and regularly congested outer ring road. About 750 homes in the villages of Longford, Sipson and Harmondsworth could be flattened to make way.

Johnson opposed the runway while he was Mayor of London -- should he decide to accept the court's judgment now, plans to build the airstrip would likely be doomed.

'This has wider implications'

Thursday's case was brought to the court by groups including Friends of the Earth, which described Thursday's ruling as ""an absolutely ground-breaking result for climate justice"" -- and climate groups seized on the decision as a sign of rapidly shifting attitudes towards the climate.

""This judgment has exciting wider implications for keeping climate change at the heart of all planning decisions,"" Will Rundle, head of legal at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. ""It's time for developers and public authorities to be held to account when it comes to the climate impact of their damaging developments.""

""It would have been hard to imagine this outcome even a couple of years ago,"" added Tim Crosland, director of the Plan B. Earth, which was involved in the case. ""But as the scale and impacts of the ecological crisis become clearer, with people dying and being displaced in the UK and around the world, it's vital we reject the politics of division and unite amidst adversity.""

The move was also hailed by Extinction Rebellion, whose frequent protests in London and around the world have become a notable feature of the growing climate movement.

And legal experts said the decision could be replicated around the world, as governments battle tensions between economic agendas with concerns over man-made damage to the climate.

""The last year has seen a surge in litigation across the globe associated with the effects and risks of climate change,"" Mary Anne Roff, a partner at the London law firm Clyde & Company, said in remarks sent to CNN.

""The Court of Appeal made clear that they have not decided that there will be no third runway at Heathrow. Nor have they decided that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the UK's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change,"" she added.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/_KXYEa0sEAA/index.html,CNN,Travel,True
['Karla Cripps'],Air New Zealand unveils economy-class sleeping pods,"(CNN) — There are people who can sleep anywhere, any time, in any position -- including upright in an economy-class airplane seat.

And then there are the rest of us. Neck pillows just don't cut it. Reclining a few inches does nothing. We need to lie flat, which is what makes Air New Zealand's prototype sleep pods so exciting.

On February 26, the airline filed patent and trademark applications for the ""Economy Skynest"" -- the result of three years of research, development and testing based on input from more than 200 customers at a hanger in Auckland.

Air New Zealand's ""Economy Skynest"" will feature six full length lie-flat sleep pods. Air New Zealand

First, the specs.

According to Air New Zealand's announcement, the Skynest will consist of six full-length lie-flat sleep pods in the Economy cabin. The exact location within the aircraft is yet to be confirmed.

Each pod will be about 200 centimeters (6.5 feet) long and 58 centimeters (22 inches) wide, and come with a pillow, sheets, blanket, ear plugs and privacy curtains. The airline is reportedly also exploring additional features such as reading lights and USB outlets.

""A clear pain point for economy travelers on long-haul flights is the inability to stretch out,"" says Air New Zealand chief marketing and customer officer Mike Tod in a statement from the airline. ""The development of the Economy Skynest is a direct response to that challenge.""

So will the Skynest actually take flight?

There's reason to be hopeful. After all, this is the airline that's already proved its commitment to making economy class more comfortable, given so many of its flights are long-haul. It launched the ""Economy Skycouch"" in 2011, allowing passengers traveling together to transform their seats into a bed.

Staff from Air New Zealand tell CNN Travel no formal certification application is in process yet, ""however we have designed the concept to meet all regulatory requirements.""

Each Skynest pod will come with a pillow, sheets and blanket. Air New Zealand

As for pricing, the airline is yet to determine the costs and is still assessing the commercial proposition and product viability.

But given there are only six pods on one aircraft, they will likely be in high demand.

""We see a future flying experience where an economy-class customer on long-haul flights would be able to book the Economy Skynest in addition to their Economy seat, get some quality rest and arrive at their destination ready to go,"" says Nikki Goodman, general manager of Air New Zealand's Customer Experience.

['Marnie Hunter'],Petition to airlines: Kids should sit with their parents,"(CNN) — Basic economy is fine if you're a solo airline passenger willing to roll the dice on a middle seat. For families, the lowest airfare class can be problematic.

Without seat assignments -- which increasingly come with a fee attached -- children may end up separated from their parents.

That's unacceptable, says Consumer Reports' advocacy arm.

Thursday, the non-profit research, media and advocacy organization posted an online petition ""demanding airlines put safety over profits.""

""Children 13 or under should sit with their families while flying, and should not be charged extra fees to do so,"" the petition reads. USA Today first reported on the petition.

By late Monday afternoon, the petition was approaching 50,000 signatures.

""Children need a responsible adult around and whether it's just so they can go to the bathroom in the middle of the flight or if there's an emergency, it's not safe to have a child without somebody there to take care of them,"" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports' advocacy arm.

""And no business traveler or solo traveler wants to be put in charge of a 3-year-old they don't know, and no parent wants to be seated, strapped in unable to move, that far from their child,"" she said.

If there's an emergency evacuation and a child is seated 10 rows behind their parent, ""no one believes that parent is going to calmly move forward and get off the plane"" without their child, Laitin said.

Seating issues

In 2016, the family seating issue aboard airlines was addressed in a Federal Aviation Administration bill passed by Congress that called upon airlines to look at seating children 13 and younger next to an accompanying family member at no additional cost.

The bill left some wiggle room, calling for such a policy ""if appropriate.""

Laitin says a couple of years went by with no word from the Department of Transportation on the issue.

So in September 2018, Consumer Reports filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out what action had been taken.

About a year later, the DOT responded with information it had gathered from airlines and enclosed 136 complaints it had collected from consumers over a period of about two and a half years.

""While that's not enormous in numbers compared to what they get on other things, (the complaints) were very striking,"" Laitin said. ""We're talking about 1- and 2-year-olds, we're talking about children with autism, families just having an enormous amount of problems getting seated with their children.""

The DOT decided not to direct airlines to establish family seating policies ""based on the low number of complaints received and review of airline family seating policies,"" the agency said on its website in a posting from September 2019.

Consumer Reports set up a portal in November 2019 letting consumers know they could complain about family seating issues to the DOT, copying Consumer Reports. Since that went live, about 450 complaints have been logged, Laitin said.

Airline policies

Consumer Reports' petition specifically calls out American, Delta and United.

The airlines offer basic economy fares that don't include seat assignments. The airlines have pop-up alerts around those fares to ensure that passengers are aware of those restrictions.

United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart said the carrier has adjusted its family seating procedures and policies.

In the summer of 2019, modifications were made to its seating engine ""to ensure that whenever possible that we assign children to a seat adjacent to an adult traveling on the same PNR, which is the passenger name record,"" Hobart said.

""We've essentially rolled out automatically seating families together. So we automatically scan for families who do not have seats assigned next to each other and we work to seat them together,"" Hobart said.

In cases where seats are not already assigned, the airline can make adjustments at the gate or on board the aircraft, he said.

""It's in our interest to have families sit next to each other, and it's clearly something that families care about. And we want to ensure that when they do travel with us they have a safe, friendly, enjoyable experience and this is one of ways that we can help make that happen,"" Hobart said.

Delta Air Lines encourages customers with seating questions to contact the airline ""as soon as possible to allow for the opportunity to address their concerns.""

""Regardless of the type of ticket purchased, Delta works with customers on a case-by-case basis to ensure their travel needs are met,"" the airline said in a statement.

American Airlines has been developing a process to ensure children younger than 15 are seated with an adult family member, the airline said in a statement.

""For families traveling with a child under the age of 15 who don't have a seat assignment, our system will work to seat the child with an adult in the reservation starting 48 hours after the reservation is ticketed. This ensures the child will not be assigned a seat alone,"" the statement said.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/1Dd3EfLkmHM/index.html,CNN,Travel,True
['Katia Hetter'],"United Airlines gives $90,000 in travel vouchers for downgrading passengers","(CNN) — United Airlines had to swap out Boeing 777 aircraft for a Saturday flight from Newark to Hawaii, resulting in a reduction of business class seats.

These aren't the passengers an airline wants to annoy.

So the airline offered miles to passengers willing to sit in a lower class of seating on the Boeing 767-300 for the 11-hour plus direct flight.

Lots of miles.

Nine passengers accepted $10,000 in travel voucher compensation each for a total of $90,000.

""Occasionally we have to change aircraft at the last minute and when that happens, we try to do the right thing and make the impact to customers as minimal as possible,"" United spokeswoman Maddie King told CNN Travel.

King confirmed that nine business class passengers volunteered to sit in a ""Premium Plus"" cabin, which offers passengers more legroom and other benefits not found in a regular coach cabin.

But she declined to confirm the compensation amount, which the ""View from the Wing"" travel blog reported as $10,000 worth of travel vouchers per passenger.

( The exact qualifications for this program aren't published, but it's given to some of the airline's most profitable customers.)

""It is probably better to get the pax (passengers) to their destination at any cost rather than bump them and risk the cost of food, lodging, a rebook and bad PR, given how full flights are this time of year.""

Travelers involuntarily bumped from US flights can be entitled to compensation if they have confirmed reservations, check in to their flights online, arrive at the departure gate on time -- if their airline can't get them to their destination within one hour of the original flight's arrival time, according to the US Department of Transportation.

Passengers on US domestic flights experiencing a one to two hour delay in their arrival times can receive compensation equal to double the one-way price of their bumped flight -- up to $675.

Domestic passengers experiencing more than a two-hour delay on flights will receive payments of four times the one-way value of their flight -- up to $1,350.

Murphy', 'Hollie Silverman']",US citizens returning from overseas say they are waiting hours for coronavirus screening at airports,"(CNN) — As Americans are being urged to keep their distance from one another, travelers returning on flights from Europe say they are being made to wait for hours in close quarters at US airports to get screened for coronavirus.

When they arrived at airports in Dallas, Chicago and New York, they faced long lines and confusion, several travelers told CNN.

President Donald Trump has announced foreign nationals in 26 European countries will face restrictions entering the US, while Ireland and the United Kingdom will be added to the list at midnight Monday.

The ban went into effect at midnight Friday, but only after the original announcement sparked chaos at European airports as Americans sought ways to return home before it went into place.

Director of National Institute of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci tells CNN's Brianna Keilar that he would like to see people avoid crowds and says those trying to return to the US from overseas should not all return immediately.

American citizens and permanent residents are allowed to fly into the US but must to go through one of 13 transit airports for screening, which caused backups at some of the airports.

Karen Rogers, a passenger returning from Paris by way of London, had been waiting in line for at least five hours to be screened at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and was told she would have at least another hour to go, she said Saturday night.

CNN has reached out to O'Hare International Airport but did not receive an immediate response.

US Customs and Border Protection is aware of the long lines and is already seeing success addressing the delays at some airports, acting commissioner Mark Morgan said in a statement.

""We're continuing to balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than the safety, health and security of our citizens.""

'Very close quarters'

The process in place at O'Hare has passengers ""essentially go(ing) through customs twice,"" said Ann Lewis Schmidt, a passenger returning from Iceland.

Passengers first wait in line to have their passports checked and to turn in a declaration form and medical forms for those returning from Europe, South Korea, Iran and China, Schmidt said.

Then they are taken to a separate line to undergo a screening and temperature check.

Passengers are grouped together for hours during the process, Schmidt said.

""Seems backwards, as if someone had a fever they should have been never allowed in these lines for four hours,"" Schmidt told CNN.

She described folks being in ""very close quarters ... so if we didn't have the virus before, we have a great chance of getting it now!""

Travelers who pass the screening are instructed to immediately self-quarantine at home and monitor their health as outlined in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's best practices, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Illinois governor calls on federal government to take action

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker reacted to the news of long lines by tweeting to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, ""The crowds & lines O'Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately. @realDonaldTrump @VP since this is the only communication medium you pay attention to -- you need to do something NOW. These crowds are waiting to get through customs which is under federal jurisdiction.""

Prtizker has spoken with local officials and is working to get the federal government to resolve the issue, he said.

""The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW,"" he tweeted.

In a tweet, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf acknowledged the long lines and the stress passengers were experiencing.

""DHS is aware of the long lines for passengers who are undergoing increased medical screening requirements. Right now we are working to add additional screening capacity and working with the airlines to expedite the process,"" he said.

""I understand this is very stressful. In these unprecedented times, we ask for your patience. It currently takes ~60 seconds for medical professionals to screen each passenger. We will be increasing capacity but the health and safety of the American public is first & foremost.""

Passengers told to share pens

At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, passengers are also facing long wait times.

Katelyn Deibler landed at JFK from Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday afternoon and it took more than two hours to complete customs, she said.

She was given two forms to fill out when she arrived, she said.

""One was just name, passport number, flight number, seat, address, emergency contact, and details about your trip,"" Deibler said.

CNN's Kristen Holmes describes what it was like in the White House briefing room when reporters had their temperatures checked ahead of a press conference with President Trump.

The second form asked specific questions about symptoms and travel to coronavirus hot zones, she said.

The form instructs passengers to circle countries they visited in the last 14 days and asks if they've had any symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing, Deibler said.

There were not enough copies for all the passengers on the flight, and many had to wait for more forms to be handed out.

""They didn't have pens and told us to share,"" she said. ""Which sounds like a great thing in the middle of the pandemic.""

Three taken to the hospital after screenings at JFK

Another traveler, Nick Carlin, also expressed concern passengers were told to share pens, and there was no hand sanitizer at JFK, he said.

""It definitely was a little scattered and disorganized,"" said Chris Nadolne, a passenger who arrived to JFK. ""I can see how people would start to get frustrated as the line got longer. ... No bathrooms nearby and no antibacterial around for people to use -- unlike in the UK and Paris where it is everywhere.""

At least three passengers who underwent screenings at JFK were sent to hospitals because of their symptoms, a source with knowledge of the JFK screenings said.

The average wait time for a health screening has been two hours, said Frank Russo, the JFK port director for US Customs and Border Control. There are more than 50 emergency medical technicians on duty supplementing CDC staff, he said.

Asked about passengers' complaints of the airport lacking hand sanitizer, he said the terminals have hand sanitizer and officers are instructing people how to find it. He has asked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the airport -- to install more dispensers in the areas where passengers are waiting, he said.

Passengers were intermingling while waiting in lines

Upon landing at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport , Kimberly Harris witnessed passengers who were in line for CDC screening skip the queue and join international passengers who did not need to be screened, she said. Harris returned from Johannesburg, South Africa, via London.

She watched the customs line grow and wrap around the entire floor, she said. ""It was difficult to tell where the line began and ended,"" Harris said. ""It almost (was) immediately evident that people who had to stay behind on the plane due to visiting a listed country were integrated into the line of the people who did not require additional screening.""

It took her three hours to make it through passport control and customs, she said. Another passenger who arrived at DFW on Sunday from Thailand by way of Doha, Qatar, described a similar scene. The coronavirus screening line was not separated from the other international arrivals, Matthew Thomas said.

""(They were) right next to us,"" he says. ""We were crowded and there for hours.""

According to reports, Ms Sitharaman's outburst came over the lapses in KYC or Know Your Customer processes for bank accounts of tea garden workers that prevented them from receiving funds transferred by the government under its direct benefit transfer scheme.

After the audio clip of the meeting emerged, the All India Bank Officers Confederation condemned the incident in a statement but later withdrew it.

""Through this communique, we once again convey our deep anguish and resentment to the Union Finance Minister for treating the Chairman of State Bank of India in such an unfair manner,"" a statement by the organisation had said.

""We are of the view that representatives of the people should abstain from indulging in such misdemeanour with any top level executive of the public sector banks,"" it added.

Amid growing controversy over Ms Sitharaman's outburst, Himanta Biswa Sarma defended the Finance Minister, saying, ""It appears that the All India Bank Officers' Confederation has not understood the context.""

,Suspense Over Madhya Pradesh Floor Test For Kamal Nath: 10 Points,"The Congress has asserted that it is the Speaker's prerogative to decide about the proceedings of the House -- a claim seen as reluctance to hold the trust vote. But a buoyed BJP maintained that the Speaker was bound by the Governor's direction.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath has claimed that he has the numbers to win the trust vote. After a state cabinet meeting this morning, minister and independent MLA Pradeep Jaiswal said, ""We have the numbers. The Chief Minister is confident. Wait and watch"".

Ahead of tomorrow's floor test, Jyotiraditya Scindia today met Union Minister and BJP leader Narendra Singh Tomar. Later, along with the BJP's former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, they met the Solicitor General to discuss the possibility of disqualification of the 22 rebel MLAs, and their right to contest elections in future.

The Congress has moved all its MLAs to Bhopal ahead of Monday's floor test mandated by the Governor. The MLAs were lodged at a resort in Jaipur.

After a cabinet meeting called by Chief Minister Kamal Nath today, the Congress said the rebel MLAs in Bengaluru were ""kidnapped"" and they were not being allowed to meet their families. .

""Many of them want to come but they are not being allowed to come back. They are being terrorized. Mobile phones have been taken away,"" a minister said. Alleging that two of its ministers were assaulted by police when they went to meet the MLAs, the Congress said the matter is a national issue and that it would approach the Supreme Court.

After the Congress allegations, many of the rebel MLAs had sent videos on which they are seen professing loyalty to Mr Scindia and reiterating their reason for resigning.

Asked about this, state cabinet minister PC Sharma said, ""They (the BJP) have hypnotized our MLAs"". The minister had performed a tantra pooja at a local temple yesterday.

The Congress has 108 MLAs in the House, and the support of seven allied legislators. If the resignations of all 22 MLAs are accepted, the Congress's strength will come way below the new majority mark of 104, and the BJP, with 107 MLAs, can form government.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/kamal-naths-cabinet-asks-him-to-decide-on-trust-vote-in-madhya-pradesh-10-points-2195194,NDTV,Top Stories,True
,"Over Petrol Price, Rahul Gandhi's ""Genius"" Jibe At PM, Finance Minister","The government on Saturday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep Rs 3 per litre (File)

Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday took a sharp jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over the recent hike in petrol and diesel prices despite a major global oil prices crash. Mr Gandhi said his advice to pass on the benefits of global price slump to the masses was ignored.

""Just 3 days ago I had requested PMO India to pass on the benefit of the global oil price crash to Indian consumers, by slashing the prices of petrol and diesel in India. Instead of heeding this advice, our genius has gone and hiked excise duty on fuel!"" Mr Gandhi tweeted today.

The government on Saturday hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep Rs 3 per litre to garner about Rs 39,000 crore additional revenue as it repeated its 2014-15 move of not passing on the gains arising from the slump in international oil prices.

According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, special excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2 to Rs 8 per litre, and to Rs 4 a litre from Rs 2 in case of diesel. Additionally, road cess was raised by Re 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10.

Petrol and diesel prices were reduced in the metros on Sunday, March 15, by 12-14 paise as oil companies moderated rate reduction.

Referring to the Madhya Pradesh political crisis, Mr Gandhi had last week attacked PM Modi in a tweet.

""Hey @PMOIndia, while you were busy destabilising an elected Congress government, you may have missed noticing the 35 per cent crash in global oil prices.

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad -- one of the most prominent faces of countrywide protests against the citizenship law -- today launched his political group, which he called the ""Azad Samaj Party"". The launch took place on the birth anniversary of BSP founder and Dalit icon Kanshi Ram. The Bhim Army, Mr Azad said, will run parallel to the party and continue to fight for Dalit rights and enrol new members.

The party flag is a white band between two blue strips, with Azad Samaj Party written in the middle.

News agency Press Trust of India reported that earlier today, the Bhim Army members claimed the police locked the gates of the venue and pasted a notice, which read, ""Event cannot be held as large gatherings are prohibited in view of coronavirus"". The gate, however, was opened later.

Mr Azad rose to political prominence during the clashes between Thakurs and Dalits in Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur three years ago. Last year, he filed nomination against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi, but later, withdrew from the contest.

Since December, as the protests against the contentious citizenship law started, he has been one of the most vocal leaders against it.

Late last year, he was arrested by the Delhi police after violence at an anti-CAA march that started in the Walled City of Delhi. Mr Azad – who addressed the protesters at the Jama Masjid just before the march started – was charged with arson, rioting and inciting violence. He was also barred from entering Delhi for four weeks.

The advocate-turned-politician has been critical of Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, accusing her of ""not doing enough for the Dalits"". Mayawati had earlier termed Azad a ""BJP agent"" and cautioned her supporters not to ""fall prey to his designs"".",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-launches-political-group-azad-samaj-party-2195262,NDTV,Top Stories,True

Some unidentified people allegedly fled with a BMW car after the man driving it pulled up to urinate on a roadside, police said on Sunday.

According to officials, the incident happened on Saturday night in Sector 90 under Phase 2 police station limits, when Rishabh Arora, a stock broker, was returning in the car from a party in an inebriated condition.

The luxury car is owned by Mr Arora's brother-in-law and there is a Rs 40 lakh loan pending on the vehicle, they said.

Mr Arora had stopped the car midway to urinate. Meanwhile, some unidentified men reached the spot and fled with the vehicle, Mr Chander added.

Prime facie, it appears the robbery was planned by someone who is known to the car's owner, Mr Chander said.

An FIR has been registered against unidentified people and the police are probing the matter and will ensure the recovery of the vehicle soon, the officer said.

Asked if the stock broker would be charged for drunken driving, Mr Chander told news agency PTI: ""The priority is to recover the BMW and ensure arrest of the culprits. It's a serious concern that somebody's car gets stolen like this on city roads.""

Mr Arora has alleged in his complaint that the men, who had arrived on a motorcycle, had put a gun on his back while he was relieving himself but that claim is yet to be verified since he was ""highly drunk"", according to officials.

,Worn-Out Nurse's Photo Shows Italy Health Workers' Fatigue In Virus Fight,"Elena Pagliarini, a nurse in the northern region of Lombardy.

A worn-out nurse slumps over her keyboard in a widely shared image symbolic of the extreme fatigue that Italian healthcare workers are facing as they battle Europe's worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The picture is of Elena Pagliarini, a nurse in the northern region of Lombardy which has been worst hit by the disease.

Nationwide Italy has more than 1,400 deaths from the virus and 21,000 infections, with a quarter of the country's intensive care beds taken up by those with the illness.

In normal times Lombardy is the economic heart of Italy, equipped with one of the world's best health systems.

But those who staff it -- like Pagliarini -- have been put under enormous strain.

""On one hand I was annoyed to see my photo everywhere, I was ashamed of showing my weakness,"" Pagliarini told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.

""But then I was happy because I got beautiful messages from people who empathised with my story,"" she said.

""I actually don't feel physically tired, I can work for 24 hours straight if it's necessary but I won't hide the fact that right now I'm anxious because I'm fighting an enemy that I don't know,"" she added.

She's just one of many healthcare workers who have expressed their concern at the toll that the outbreak is taking, on facilities and personnel alike.

""It's almost two weeks since I've seen my son or my family because I'm worried about infecting them,"" Daniele Macchini, a hospital doctor in the northern city of Bergamo, (also in Lombardy) wrote in a widely-shared Facebook post.

""I settle for some photos of my son which I look at through my tears, and a few video calls,"" he says.

""Psychologically tired""

Further south in Tuscany, the health system is also starting to feel the pressure.

A nurse in the Tuscan town of Grossetto, Alessia Bonari, posted an image on Instagram of her face bearing marks from a long day of wearing a surgical mask.

""I'm worried because the mask might not be fitting right on my face, I might touch myself accidentally with dirty gloves, the glasses might not totally cover my eyes,"" she wrote in the caption.

She said that the protective gear staff had to wear meant that she couldn't drink or go to the toilet for six hours at a time.

To add to the physical fatigue she said she and all her colleagues had been ""psychologically tired"" for weeks from the workload.

The San Giovanni Bosco hospital in the northern city of Turin this week put a mental health team in place to help its staff counter the stress of the current situation, above all for those working in emergency departments and in intensive care.

""All those who need it can come forward, we're there for everyone,"" Monica Agnesone, one of the 20 psychologists in the team, told the La Stampa newspaper.

She explained that other doctors and hospital staff were suffering from the ""fear of making mistakes, of being infected, of not being able to carry on in these conditions"".

On Thursday Italian media reported that in the northern town of Bergamo alone around 50 doctors had tested positive for the virus.

Further south in a hospital in the Puglia region,local media reported that 76 employees had to go into quarantine after being in contact with patients who tested positive for the virus.

Six of them had to be admitted to hospital, with one needing intensive care.

Agnesone's strategies for coping with the stress will no doubt be increasingly called on in the weeks to come.

She recommends ""carving out moments where you can detach, re-centre yourself, lowering the level of tension by using breathing exercises and focusing on other things.""

Otherwise, she warns, ""stress ends up wearing out your energy"".

With just five days left for the execution of the death sentence in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, the Tihar Jail authorities on Sunday said they have asked the hangman to report three days ahead of the scheduled hanging.

The four convicts in the case are scheduled to hang together at 5.30 am on March 20, according to an order by a Delhi court earlier this month.

The death row convicts are Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

The execution of their death warrants has been deferred thrice so far due to delays caused by the convicts trying to exhaust all legal remedies available to them.

After the fresh death warrant was issued, the Tihar Jail authorities wrote to their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh requesting for the service of hangman Pawan Jallad, a senior jail official said.

""Pawan Jallad, a hangman from Meerut, has been asked to report at Tihar Jail on March 17, three days ahead of the scheduled date of hanging,"" said Sandeep Goel, DG (Prisons).

According to the jail authorities, dummy executions will be conducted again after the arrival of Pawan Jallad.

Health checks-up of the convicts is being done once in a day. They are also being counselled on a regular basis, they said.

Out of the four convicts, Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay have already had their last face-to-face meetings with their respective families. The authorities have written to the family of Akshay about the date of the final meeting before the scheduled date of execution.

The jail authorities have also not stopped the convicts' weekly meetings with their families yet.

,Four Gujarat Congress MLAs Resign Ahead Of Rajya Saba Polls,"The Congress shifted around two dozen of its MLAs to Jaipur fearing poaching (Representational)

Four Congress MLAs in Gujarat have tendered their resignation to Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi ahead of the election to the four Rajya Sabha seats in the state to be held on March 26, prompting the opposition party to shift at least 24 MLAs to Jaipur on Sunday.

While the Congress said not a single ""honest"" MLA has resigned, state BJP president Jitu Vaghani said if the four legislators have indeed quit, the saffron party will win three seats in the Rajya Sabha elections.

Later, the Congress shifted around two dozen of its MLAs to Jaipur fearing poaching.

These moves come as Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi confirmed on Sunday that four Congress MLAs had tendered their resignations on Saturday, all of which had been accepted.

Mr Trivedi said he would disclose the names of the four MLAs during the Assembly session on Monday.

""Four Congress MLAs tendered their resignation to me on Saturday, and I will announce their names in the Assembly tomorrow,"" the speaker told PTI.

Mr Vaghani said he was informed about the development by the speaker.

""Trivedi said that the names of the MLAs who have resigned will be announced in the Assembly on Monday which is in session. MLAs of the Congress have resigned it seems. It means the BJP is winning three seats (in the upcoming Rajya Sabha election),"" Mr Vaghani told reporters.

He said the Congress can withdraw its candidates form the Rajya Sabha election fray till Monday.

BJP Minister in the state government, Kunvarji Bavaliya, claimed that several Congress MLAs who are not happy with their party are in touch with the BJP. He said several such MLAs are likely to join the ruling party in coming days.

""After the announcement of the Rajya Sabha election, several Congress MLAs who have been in touch with us say they are not happy (with their party). Even the MLAs whom the Congress high command could not contact (for shifting them outside Gujarat) are also preparing to join the BJP,"" he said.

In a tweet in Gujarati, Congress leader Paresh Dhanani said not a single ""honest"" Congress MLAs has resigned so far.

With the resignation of four MLAs, the strength of the Congress party in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly has come down to 69 from 73.

The Congress had on Saturday shifted its 14 MLAs to Jaipur fearing horse-trading by the ruling BJP ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls.

The BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramila Bara and Narhari Amin for the RS election.

Given its number in the Assembly, the ruling party can only win two seats unless it manages cross-voting from the opposition camp or ensure defection of Congress MLAs to win the third seat.

The Congress has fielded senior leaders Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki.

,Coronavirus: Liverpool Left To Wait And Wonder With Premier League In Limbo,"Liverpool could have been crowned Premier League champions on Monday for the first time in a generation. Instead the stadium will be silent and the streets empty. Jurgen Klopp's team needed Manchester City to lose to Burnley on Saturday to give them a chance to seal the deal at their local rivals Everton two days later. Regardless of whether it would have happened at Goodison Park or over the coming weeks, their first top-flight title for 30 years was a mere formality. But now fans are wondering when, or even if, they will be crowned champions after the coronavirus laid waste to the global sporting calendar .

The message coming from Liverpool is that there are more important issues than football to talk about, even with the club tantalisingly close to glory.

""I've said before that football always seems the most important of the least important things,"" Klopp said in a statement on Friday.

""Today, football and football matches really aren't important at all.

""If it's a choice between football and the good of the wider society, it's no contest. Really, it isn't.""

Klopp's stance won him the support of World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who thanked him for his ""powerful message"".

Liverpool supporters, desperate to reclaim their position at the pinnacle of the English game, agree with their German manager, saying the pandemic overshadows football.

Supporters' union Spirit of Shankly is focusing on the damaging fallout from the COVID-19 virus.

""In talks with @lfc we asked for assurances that non-playing staff will not lose their pay as a consequence of shifts being cancelled,"" it said in a statement.

""We also need to keep in mind those most vulnerable. Cancelling football games means (foodbanks) will be hit hard.""

Deserving winners

Liverpool have stumbled in recent weeks, knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid and dumped out of the FA Cup by Chelsea.

But they have been peerless in the Premier League, leaving their rivals in their wake to race 25 points clear of defending champions Manchester City.

With Alisson Becker in goal, Virgil van Dijk marshalling the defence and their devastating front three of Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, Klopp's men have been irresistible.

Paul Hayward, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said Liverpool should be crowned champions for the 19th time even if no more games are played.

""If a season ends too soon, its natural winning line is the point it reached before the halt was called: emphatically so, 29 games into a 38-match campaign, which is a respectable distance,"" he wrote.

""'Voiding' the 2019/20 football season would be nonsense,"" he added. ""Handing over the trophy at any point where clubs were forced to give up would feel morally correct.""

Brighton and Hove Albion chief executive Paul Barber said if the season were to be ""frozen"" it would be unjust on Liverpool.

""Everybody in the game appreciates what a fantastic season they've had and what a wonderful team they are,"" he told the BBC.

""But equally it would be unjust for teams to be relegated when there are still eight, nine, ten games to play of the Premier League.""

But West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said if the fixtures could not be completed, the only fair solution would be to declare the season ""null and void"".

Writing in the Sun, Brady, whose club are just two places above the relegation zone, said: ""Who knows who would have gone down or come up if the games have not actually been played in full?

""A huge blow to Liverpool, who might be robbed of their first title in 30 years.""

Nobody knows when football will return but, when it finally does, many in the game hope Liverpool are given the chance to complete their long journey back to the top.",https://sports.ndtv.com/football/coronavirus-liverpool-left-to-wait-and-wonder-2195172,NDTV,Sports,True

But at Eden Gardens, something surreal happened.

Australia had scored 445 in their first innings on the back of captain Steve Waugh's 110 and 97 from Matthew Hayden, however it was Harbhajan Singh who stole the show, claiming 7/123 including the first hat-trick in India's Test history.

Australia continued their surge despite Harbhajan's heroics, bundling out the home side for 171 in reply, with Glenn McGrath taking 4/18.

Waugh's men looked good to be marching to a 17th straight Test win after enforcing the follow-on. India were reduced to 3/115 and then 4/232 in their second innings - still trailing by 42 with just six wickets in hand when VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid joined hands.

The pair famously shared a 376-run stand for the fifth wicket, and put their team 334 runs in front.

VVS Laxman scored a career-best 281, while Dravid added 180.

Set an improbable 384 to win in little more than two sessions on day five, Australia were outfoxed by Harbhajan, who added six wickets to his seven from the first dig and rounded out one of Test cricket's most famous victories.",https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/on-this-day-in-2001-indias-historic-win-over-australia-at-eden-gardens-2195168,NDTV,Sports,True

,"""How About You Amaze Me"": Simone Biles' Dig At USA Gymnastics In Birthday Tweet","Four-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles wants more than good wishes from USA Gymnastics. The US federation wished Biles a happy 23rd birthday on social media on Saturday. Biles -- who also owns 19 world titles and is expected to be among the stars of the Tokyo Olympics -- used their tweet as a chance to demand an independent investigation into the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal. ""how about you amaze me and do the right thing ... have an independent investigation,"" Biles snapped on Twitter after the federation's birthday tweet.

""HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most decorated gymnast of all time, @simonebiles!"" USA Gymnastics wrote, posting a video of Biles in action in a floor exercise. ""We know you will only continue to amaze us and make history!""

how about you amaze me and do the right thing... have an independent investigation https://t.co/58Gc9QUk76 — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) March 14, 2020

Former national gymnastics team doctor Nassar was jailed for life for abusing more than 250 athletes, including stars of the United States' 2012 and 2016 gold medal-winning Olympic teams.

A US Senate investigation found that ""multiple institutions"" failed to adequately respond to credible allegations against Nassar, but Biles has said that USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee still owe his victims, including herself, more answers and a framework to ensure such abuses won't occur again.

""Wish they BOTH wanted an independent investigation as much as the survivors & I do,"" she tweeted earlier this month.

As Biles and other elite gymnasts ramp up their preparations for Tokyo, USA Gymnastics in January offered a $215 million (194 million euros) settlement to victims of Nassar to settle legal claims -- a plan a lawyer for more than 200 women called ""unconscionable.""

Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who is now retired, called the settlement offer ""offensive"" and accused the federation of attempting to prevent release of details which would show how Nassar was able to abuse athletes for years.

Attorney John Manley, who represents more than 180 clients with active claims against USA Gymnastics, said the settlement offer releases too many people from further claims, including the USOPC, former USA Gymnastics chief Steve Penny and former national team directors Bela and Marta Karolyi.",https://sports.ndtv.com/gymnastics/how-about-you-amaze-me-simone-biles-dig-at-usa-gymnastics-in-birthday-tweet-2195147,NDTV,Sports,True

,David Beckham Visits Empty Stadium As MLS Club's Home Debut Delayed,"David Beckham's six-year wait to watch his Major League Soccer club make its home debut, which was to have ended Saturday, has been extended by the league's coronavirus shutdown . But that didn't stop him and his family from visiting Inter Miami's empty stadium on Saturday. Beckham's club was to have hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy, the MLS club where the former England and Manchester United star played from 2007 through 2012, in its first match at its temporary home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Instead, the entire league has joined all major North American sports leagues and shut down its season for 30 days due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

That left Inter Miami owner and president David Beckham and his wife, Victoria, to take their four children to the empty venue and post a video on Instagram.

""Special day showing the family what we've built,"" Beckham posted as the camera made a 360-degree tour of empty Inter Miami Stadium while music of Spice Girls -- his wife's former group -- blared through the loudspeakers.

Beckham also posted messages Friday on Instagram with photos taken from the field in the empty 20,000-seat stadium.

""It's times like these when we are reminded of the things that are truly important in life,"" Beckham posted on Instagram. ""Our health. Our loved ones and looking after those that need support in our communities.

""In these moments, sports take a back seat. We must all listen to expert advice and do the right thing. Stay safe and look out for yourselves and your families.""

Inter Miami still seeks a first-ever MLS triumph, having lost 1-0 at Los Angeles FC on March 1 and 2-1 at DC United six days later.

Those matches culminated a wild six-year effort filled with setbacks and frustrations.

Beckham, 44, came to the United States in 2007, the global icon leaving Real Madrid for a deal with the Galaxy that included the option to buy an MLS expansion club at a discounted price.

Over six seasons with the Galaxy, Beckham helped raise the sport's US profile and was a major contributor to the club's 2011 and 2012 MLS Cup titles.

After retiring in 2013, Beckham decided to exercise his option for an MLS expansion team in 2014 and sought to build a soccer-specific stadium in Miami.

Struggles with city leaders and civic groups followed, location after location foiled by one problem after another, and MLS hesitated to award a franchise to a group without a stadium plan set in place.

Beckham joined with Miami-based construction magnates Jorge and Jose Mas in 2017 and that represented a turning point in his quest.

In 2018, city officials approved construction of the Miami Freedom Park complex near Miami International Airport, its centrepiece being a new 25,000-seat stadium that is expected to be ready for Inter Miami to move into in 2022.

""Everything we've tried to do to get this franchise up and running was a challenge,"" Beckham said last month.

""There wasn't one (easy) thing -- from finding the land, thinking what kind of stadium we want, what kind of players we want, what kind of manager we want, even down to what tiles we had in the showers -- everything was a challenge.

,Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Pledges Olympics To Go Ahead Despite Coronavirus Havoc,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday resisted pressure for changes to the Tokyo Olympics schedule even as sporting events worldwide fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic. Abe pledged Japan would host the Games as planned in July and said he had no immediate intention to declare a state of emergency over the virus outbreak, which has now seen more than 140,000 people infected across the globe and over 5,400 killed.

His comments come two days after US President Donald Trump suggested the Japanese capital postpone the Games for a year as the spread of the virus wreaks havoc on the sporting calendar.

""We will respond by closely coordinating with officials concerned, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee). There is no change in this,"" Abe told a news conference.

""We want to hold the Olympics as planned without any trouble by overcoming the spread of infections,"" he said.

Organisers, Japanese government officials and the IOC have insisted preparations are on track and there will be no postponement or cancellation.

England's football Premier League, America's NBA basketball season and the Augusta Masters golf major are just some of the competitions suspended because of the pandemic.

On Friday, Abe and Trump spoke on the phone about the outbreak and Olympics after Trump proposed a delay.

""We agreed that Japan and the US will cooperate and closely coordinate for success in the Olympics,"" Abe said, adding they had not discussed any postponement.

The Japanese parliament on Friday approved legislation that gives Abe the power to declare a state of emergency to combat COVID-19 but Abe insisted such a declaration was not yet necessary.

The coronavirus has infected more than 700 people across Japan and been linked to 21 deaths. Separately, 700 people on board a cruise ship that docked near Tokyo last month were also infected.

A state of emergency would allow local governments to require that people stay indoors, schools close and public facilities limit use.

Land and buildings could be requisitioned for makeshift hospitals.

IOC chief Thomas Bach told German television broadcaster ARD on Thursday that the body would follow recommendations by the World Health Organization but that work continued for a successful Games.

,"ATK Win Record Third ISL Title, Beat Chennaiyin 3-1 In Final","A rampaging ATK claimed an unprecedented third Indian Super League (ISL) title triumph with a 3-1 victory over arch-rival Chennaiyin FC in a summit showdown that was played behind closed doors in Margao on Saturday. Javier Hernandez (10th) and Edu Garcia (48th) put ATK in the driving seat but Nerijus Valskis (69th) reduced their advantage to set up a tense end to the contest. Hernandez scored another in injury time (90+4th) to confirm a record third title. The final was held without spectators owing to the COVID-19 pandemic .

The match was off to a blistering start as Andre Schembri made a good run to the byline on the right in the first minute and found Rafael Crivellaro in the centre with a good cross, but the Brazilian mishit his effort. Schembri threatened again minutes later, this time with a pass to Valskis whose shot hit the crossbar.

ATK drew first blood with their first major sight of goal in the 10th minute.

John Johnson's cross-field ball found Roy Krishna on the left flank who delivered a good cross towards the edge of the box. Javier Hernandez, who was left unmarked, smashed a half-volley into the ground and beat goalkeeper Vishal Kaith to give ATK the lead.

The contest remained open but Chennaiyin suffered an injury setback midway through the first half. Midfielder Germanpreet Singh had to be replaced and Edwin Vanspaul took his place.

ATK went close to doubling their lead in the 23rd minute out of utter chaos inside the box which produced three back-to-back attempts.

Krishna cut in from the right and unleashed a powerful strike which was saved by Kaith. Javier Hernandez then had the ball at his feet twice, but on both occasions, his shot was blocked. Chennaiyin put pressure on the ATK defence and carved out a golden chance from a free-kick after the 30-minute-mark.

Schembri met Crivellaro's delivery into the box but Arindam Bhattacharya pulled off an excellent save to keep ATK's lead intact.

The scoreline remained 1-0 in favour of ATK at the break, but the Kolkata side had a concern of their own as Krishna had to be replaced by Mandi Sosa due to an injury.



ATK scored the all-important second goal and doubled their advantage two minutes into the second half.

Williams picked up the ball in midfield and fed Edu Garcia into the box. The Spanish midfielder beat Kaith with a neat finish from an acute angle to make it 2-0.

The Chennaiyin attack struggled to create clear-cut chances and their opponents restricted them to long-range efforts.

Lallianzuala Chhangte attempted a piledriver from outside the box before the hour mark but sent the ball wide.

Chennaiyin finally found a way past the ATK defence in the 69th minute.

Laldinliana Renthlei played a neat one-two with Anirudh Thapa on the right before sending a cross into the centre of the box.

Pritam Kotal's headed clearance fell to Jerry Lalrinzuala who passed the ball to Valskis in the centre.

The Lithuanian striker found the net with a powerful strike to score his 15th goal of the season and give Chennaiyin a lifeline.

Chennaiyin built one attack after another as the game neared full-time but the balls into the box were well dealt by ATK.

ATK got their third goal of the night and struck the final blow in the last minute of injury time.

,"Mobile Phone Sales to Be Hit, Say Industry Experts, as GST Hike Makes Them More Costly","With the GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, increasing the GST on mobile phones from 12 percent to 18 percent on Saturday, industry experts feel it would hit the industry and the consumers hard.

Brands are in no position to absorb this impact. ""They will, most certainly, decide to pass it on to the consumer, at least in case of high-selling models,"" said Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) stressed that the move would stymie consumption.

""The 6 percent GST increase will be detrimental to the vision of 'digital India'. Consumption will be stymied and our domestic consumption target of $80 billion (Rs. 6,00,000 crores) by 2025 will not be achieved. We will fall short by at least Rs. 2,00,000 crores,"" said Pankaj Mohindroo, ICEA Chairman.

In a letter to the Finance Minister on March 12, the ICEA had said the mobile handsets sector was in deep stress because of the supply chain disruption due to coronavirus outbreak. It was the most inappropriate time to consider GST hike on mobile phones, the industry body said.

It also said the GST hike on mobile phone might adversely affect localisation of manufacturing as well as popularisation of the country's digital payments objectives.

According to ICEA, 31-32 crore Indians who buy phones in the country will be impacted by the move.

Terming the move counter-intuitive and detrimental to the 'digital India' vision, the IDC India Research Director said, ""This is a textbook case of missing the wood for the trees. This will stunt any hope of growth in the near-term, which anyway looks challenging now due to coronavirus issue at both supply and demand ends,"" Singh told IANS.

,Coronavirus: Indian Firms Struggling to Deal With Work From Home Scenario Amid COVID-19 Pandemic,"While it makes perfect sense for IT employees to work from remote locations via video conferencing and collaboration tools seamlessly - especially in the case of tech giants like Google or Microsoft -- workers from the non-IT companies and small and medium enterprises (SMBs) are the worst-hit in India as most of them have little or no clue about how these messaging and collaboration tools work amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Small companies -- from corporate to education verticals -- are scrambling to get their act together as new coronavirus threat has reached their premises, prompting them to send employees home who have age-old laptops, poor network and connectivity with no UPS backups and little knowledge about how to handle group chat and collaboration software like Zoom, Google Hangouts Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Flock etc.

Coronavirus Impact: Google Hangouts Meet, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex Made Free to Encourage Work From Home

Instead of halting operations, however, businesses can choose to shift towards remote working methods with teaching non-IT staff on how to use the latest digital software to connect and work, say industry experts.

The training will take some time and may hamper productivity in the short run but is a win-win situation for the non-tech companies in the long run, in case any such global emergency arises in the future.

According to a latest report by Gartner, 54 percent of HR leaders have cited that poor technology and/or infrastructure for remote working is the biggest barrier to effective remote working.

Sandy Shen, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, says that with COVID-19 disrupting the business landscape, CIOs should relook at the digital fulfilment of market demand.

""The value of digital channels, products and operations is immediately obvious to companies everywhere right now. This is a wake-up call for organisations that have placed too much focus on daily operational needs at the expense of investing in digital business and long-term resilience,"" warned Shen.

Businesses that can shift technology capacity and investments to digital platforms will mitigate the impact of the outbreak and keep their companies running smoothly now, and over the long term.

""Videoconferencing, messaging, collaboration tools and document sharing are just a few examples of technologies that facilitate remote work. Additional bandwidth and network capacity may also be needed, given the increasing number of users and volume of communications,"" informed Shen.

The IT industry's apex body Nasscom has asked the government to relax norms for a month to allow work-from-home for technology and back-office employees as a measure to deal with the spread of COVID-19 in India.

Networking giant Cisco said that it has seen ""significant growth"" in the usage of its web conferencing and video-conferencing service Webex in India.

According to Muneer Ahmad, Business Head, ViewSonic India, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the corporate and educational sector is severely getting affected in the country.

""ViewSonic IFP has a cloud-based software which help teachers and corporates to connect through video conferencing to multiple people at the same time and can split the screen into six screens. It can also connect with various tools like Skype, Cisco WebEx, Zoom, Google Hangouts and GoToMeeting,"" Ahmad told IANS.

Co-working sector has also taken a hit and the industry is looking at several measures to tackle it -- from ensuring supply of juices rich in Vitamin C to supply of disinfectants and giving work from home facilities.

""The scheduled visits of the clients at our co-working offices have been postponed. Few of our clients have cancelled their outstation meetings and have now started audio/video conferencing for virtual meetings,"" said Nakul Mathur, MD, Avanta India.

""Facebook is matching up to $10 million in donations, and 100 percent of funds will directly support the work to prevent, detect and respond to the outbreak around the world,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on the social media platform on Friday.

""We'll also match $10 million for the CDC Foundation, which will launch a fundraiser in the next few weeks focused on combating the outbreak here in the US,"" he added.

Facebook said on Friday that it is committing to match $20 million (roughly Rs. 147 crores) in donations, a fraction of its quarterly profit, to support global relief efforts for COVID-19 pandemic.

Mark Zuckerberg, the social juggernaut's chief executive, said Facebook was committing $10 million for the United Nations Foundation (UNF) and World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund and an additional $10 million for the CDC Foundation, which will launch its Facebook Fundraiser in the coming weeks.

According to a report in TechCrunch, Chinese ride-hailing giant DiDi Chuxing on Friday announced a $10 million special relief fund for drivers and couriers in its international markets, thanks to coronavirus.

Among other tech giants, Microsoft and Amazon this week committed $1 million each to COVID-19 Response Fund.

,GST Council Raises Tax on Mobile Phones to 18 Percent From 12 Percent,"The GST Council on Saturday decided to increase GST rates on mobile phones to 18 percent from 12 percent with effect from April 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. The Council also decided to slash GST on maintenance repair overhaul (MRO) services for aircraft to 5 percent from 12 percent while the tax rate on handmade and machine-made matchsticks has been rationalised to 12 percent.

The Council in its meeting chaired by the Union finance minister decided to waive late fee for delayed filing of annual returns for FY2018, FY2019 by entities with a turnover of less than Rs. 2 crores. The minister also said that interest will be levied on net tax liability from July 1 for delayed GST payments.

Sitharaman said the GST Council has asked Infosys to deploy more skilled manpower, increase capacity of hardware of GST Network to ensure that the system is glitch-free.

,Elon Musk Tells Staff Car Crashes Are Deadlier Than Coronavirus: Report,"Amid the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus which has killed nearly 5,000 people in the world, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to be dancing to his own tune, underplaying the danger from the threat time and again.

In a memo to SpaceX employees on Friday, Musk said that they were far less likely to die from COVID-19 than car crashes, BuzzFeed News reported.

Musk added in the email that he does not think COVID-19 is ""within the top 100 health risks in the United States"".

In the US, over 1,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported, while more than 40 people have died due to the disease caused by the virus.

According to a report in The New York Times that cited an estimate by health officials, if the spread of the novel coronavirus is not contained soon, between 160 million and 214 million Americans may become infected in the worst case scenario.

This is not the first time Musk has underplayed the danger from COVID-19.

In a tweet last week he said that ""the coronavirus panic is dumb.""

It's not that he did not explain why he thought so. In replies to a Twitter user's question, he said that both the virality of COVID-19 and fatality rate are overstated.

""Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating & virus will exceed mass of known universe,"" the tech billionaire reasoned.

""Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high,"" Musk said.

However, in view of the global spread of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization has already declared it a pandemic.

Globally, coronavirus has infected over 132,500 people in 123 countries.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/transportation/news/elon-musk-tells-staff-car-crashes-are-deadlier-than-coronavirus-report-2194971,NDTV,Tech,True

He also offered the United States 500,000 coronavirus test kits and a million masks, as the country faces a shortage of kits for diagnosing the potentially deadly disease.

A cargo plane loaded with 500,000 masks and other medical supplies such as test kits landed at Liege Airport. The consignment will be sent to Italy, a joint statement by the Alibaba and Jack Ma foundations, the Belgian region of Wallonia and Liege Airport said.

Further flights are due arrive in coming days to the airport, which is set to become Alibaba's main European hub for e-commerce shipments.

Ma has also said he will donate 500,000 coronavirus testing kits and one million masks to the United States, while urging international cooperation to fight the health crisis.

First one should be the Pixel 4a series, successor to the Pixel 3a series lunched last year, and the Pixel 5 series, which is expected to launch later in October. Information regarding both the phones has surfaced online, and the Pixel 4a is reported to support UFS 2.1 storage for faster app loading and files transfer. The Pixel 5, on the other hand, is reported to not offer flagship-level specifications this time around, and it may be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC.

Starting with the Pixel 4a, XDA Developers report that the upcoming device will support UFS 2.1 storage, instead of the eMMC flash storage found on the predecessor Pixel 3a. YouTuber Julio Lusson shared the bootloader screen of the Pixel 4a that showed a line that read “Ufs: 64GB SKHynix.” With this, the publication determined that the Google Pixel 4a pre-production unit with Lusson has the 64GB UFS 2.1 H9HQ53AECMMDAR-KEM from SK Hynix integrated. This is a strong indication that Google is making the shift to UFS storage with Pixel 4a, bringing better power management, better read and write speeds, and faster app loading and installation. However, Google may or may not integrate it in the final unit, so it's best to take things lightly for now.

Lusson also shared access to a pre-release version of the Google Camera app from the Pixel 4a pre-production unit with 9to5Google, and the teardown of the app reveals that the Pixel 4a may include a telephoto lens. The Pixel 4a is referred to as “photo_pixel_2020_midrange_config” inside the app, and there's code that reads SABRE_UNZOOMED_TELEPHOTO — hinting at a telephoto lens. Pixel 5, expected to release later in the year, is referred to as “photo_pixel_2020_config” inside the Google Camera app. The teardown reveals that the Pixel 5 may have two codenames – Bramble and Redfin.

If we are to backtrack a few months, a report had suggested that Google's Bramble and Redfin phones may be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC. At that time, these phones were speculated to be the Pixel 4a, but this new teardown suggests that they belong to the Pixel 5. All of this means, the Google's Pixel 5 phone may break the tradition and not be powered by Qualcomm's flagship chipset, but instead be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC, a popular second-best option with built-in 5G support. Of course, this is very early speculation, and Google still has plenty of time to fiddle around before making final calls. Pixel 5 is reported to feature reverse wireless charging, and offer triple rear cameras.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/pixel-5-4a-ufs-2-1-storage-snapdragon-765g-soc-code-teardown-2194942,NDTV,Tech,True
,"Coronavirus: Apple to Close Retail Stores Worldwide, Except Greater China, Until March 27","Apple Inc said late on Friday it will close all its retail stores, except those in Greater China, for the next two weeks to minimize the risk of coronavirus transmission.

""We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a letter posted on the company's website.

""In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China,"" he added. ""That means team members should work remotely if their job allows.""

Apple reopened all 42 of its branded stores in China on Friday.

The company's donations to the global coronavirus response, to help treat those who are sick and to help lessen the economic and community impacts, reached $15 million on Friday, Cook wrote in the letter.

More than 138,000 people have been infected worldwide and over 5,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements.

In His Free Time', 'You Will Find Akhil Beating The Computer At Ea Sports Fifa Or Streaming New Highly-Rated Tv Series.']",Hotstar Pauses Weekly Disney+ Content Rollout in India,"This past Friday, Disney+ released a new coming-of-age movie called Stargirl — not to be confused with the upcoming DC Universe series of the same name — in addition to a new episode for several ongoing scripted and reality series, including the likes of Diary of a Future President, Disney Family Sundays, Fairy Tale Weddings, Marvel's Hero Project, One Day at Disney, Pixar in Real Life, and Shop Class. But none of that is available on Hotstar — or Disney+ Hotstar, depending on how it's feeling — even a day later, despite all the Disney+ originals being released in India earlier this week on Wednesday.

That signals that Hotstar has paused the weekly rollout of new Disney+ content in India. Gadgets 360 has reached out to Hotstar for confirmation and comment on when the moratorium is expected to be lifted. After abruptly dropping everything on Wednesday, it's unclear why Hotstar has now decided to not push out new content, especially in the case of the seven aforementioned series, which are already available on Hotstar. The last new episode for each series is from the Friday before. It's a curious choice, to say the least, though it does fit the pattern set by Hotstar — one of utter confusion.

Hotstar has completely bungled the launch of Disney+ in India. A bit of catch-up for those who need it. Early Wednesday, Hotstar pushed out all Disney+ originals as it finished rebranding its apps to “Disney+ Hotstar”. But it then changed its mind later that day. The content was hidden from search, the rebranding largely disappeared — depending on when and where you access it, the app icon might read “Hotstar” or “Disney+ Hotstar” — though the new blue colour theme stayed. Hotstar said the new app was in beta test until the full launch on March 29, but that seemed like a cover-up for its faux pas.

Some of those concerns were expected to be addressed at a launch event in Mumbai on Friday, which was cancelled at the last minute, citing the ongoing coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. And after the BCCI's decision on Friday to postpone the start of the 2020 Indian Premier League season until mid-April in the wake of growing concerns around the pandemic, Disney+'s official arrival in India could get delayed, given its desire to time Disney+'s India launch with the start of IPL. Hotstar has not responded to Gadgets 360's multiple requests for comment on a possible launch delay.

Owing to all that, it's easily possible that Hotstar subscribers in India might not see any new Disney+ content until mid-April. After a pleasant Wednesday surprise, Hotstar has switched back to regular programming: letting its users down.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/news/hotstar-disney-plus-india-content-paused-launch-no-weekly-shows-movies-2194889,NDTV,Tech,True
,Facebook to Shut Down MSQRD AR Face-Filtering App,"Facebook has announced to shut down its Augmented Reality (AR) face-filtering app called MSQRD.

On April 13, Facebook will remove the app from both the Android and iOS app stores.

Facebook acquired MSQRD in 2016 and the AR app played a key role in enhancing the company's portfolio of AR image and video tools like 'Spark AR' that lets users create custom face filters for Facebook and Instagram.

""MSQRD was fundamental to building early momentum for AR and providing insights to build the platform Facebook has today,"" the company said in a statement late Friday.

""Our focus is now on delivering you the best-possible AR experiences through Spark AR, the platform that allows anyone to create their own AR effects and share them across the Facebook family,"" it added.

People can still find AR effects directly within Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Portal.

Today, Instagram and Snapchat offer several in-built face-swapping tools.

Fuelled by Snapchat Lenses and Facebook Stories, AR is gaining fast traction.

Facebook is currently building its own operating system (OS) from scratch that will power its hardware: mainly AR and virtual reality (VR) headsets like Oculus and video calling devices like Portal that currently runs Google's Android OS.

By moving to its own OS, Facebook could integrate more indigenous features into its devices, and hopefully privacy, creating a custom OS for its AR glasses or Portal devices.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/facebook-to-shut-down-msqrd-ar-face-filtering-app-2194861,NDTV,Tech,True

,Bill Gates Steps Down From Microsoft Board,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates leaves board

Microsoft on Friday announced that co-founder Bill Gates has left its board of directors to devote more time to philanthropy.

The 64-year-old stopped being involved in day-to-day operations at the firm more than a decade ago, turning his attention to the foundation he launched with his wife, Melinda.

Gates served as chairman of Microsoft's board of directors until early in 2014 and has now stepped away entirely, according to the Redmond-based technology giant.

""It's been a tremendous honor and privilege to have worked with and learned from Bill over the years,"" Microsoft chief executive and company veteran Satya Nadella said in a release.

""Bill founded our company with a belief in the democratizing force of software and a passion to solve society's most pressing challenges; and Microsoft and the world are better for it.""

Nadella said Microsoft would continue to benefit from Gates' ""technical passion and advice"" in his continuing role as a technical advisor.

""I am grateful for Bill's friendship and look forward to continuing to work alongside him,"" Nadella said.

Computing and compassion -

Gates left his CEO position in 2000, handing the company reins to Steve Ballmer to devote more time to his charitable foundation.

He gave up the role of chairman at the same time Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO in 2014.

Regularly listed among the world's richest people, William H. Gates was a geeky-looking young man when he and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft in 1975.

Gates grew up in Seattle with two sisters. His father William was an attorney and his late mother Mary was a schoolteacher and chairwoman of United Way International.

He began programming computers as a 13-year-old student, and fell in love with the machines.

Among the tales told about Gates is that while working on school computers, he tinkered with programming to put himself in classes made up mostly of girls.

With his parents' blessing, Gates dropped out of Harvard to start ""Micro-soft"" with his late childhood friend Allen.

A key move was to focus on licensing software to computer makers in numerous ""partnerships"" that resulted in affordable machines being available to the masses.

As the personal computer market grew, Microsoft became the world's top software company. Its virtual monopoly led to a much-publicized antitrust trial, in which the company managed to avert a break-up but had to endure years of government monitoring.

Gates went on to turn his attention from software to fighting disease and other humanitarian challenges with his wife, under the auspices of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

""This move is not surprising to the Street as Gates has continued to focus more on his myriad of philanthropies across the globe over the past decade,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors.

,WWDC 2020 Developer Conference Shifted to Online-Only Format by Apple Over Coronavirus Fears,"In a wise decision, Apple on Friday announced it will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June but digital-only owing to coronavirus pandemic.

Now in its 31st year, Apple WWDC 2020 will take on an entirely new online format packed with content for consumers, press and developers alike.

The online event will be an opportunity for millions developers to get early access to the future of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, and engage with Apple engineers as they work to build app experiences that enrich the lives of Apple customers around the globe, the company said in a statement

""We are delivering WWDC 2020 this June in an innovative way to millions of developers around the world, bringing the entire developer community together with a new experience,"" said Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.

""The current health situation has required that we create a new WWDC 2020 format that delivers a full program with an online keynote and sessions, offering a great learning experience for our entire developer community, all around the world. We will be sharing all of the details in the weeks ahead,"" he added.

""With all of the new products and technologies we've been working on, WWDC 2020 is going to be big,"" said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering.

The WWDC 2020 programme will provide Apple's entire global developer community -- which now includes more than 23 million registered developers in more than 155 countries and regions -- and the next generation of app developers with the insights and tools needed to turn their ideas into a reality.

""I look forward to our developers getting their hands on the new code and interacting in entirely new ways with the Apple engineers building the technologies and frameworks that will shape the future across all Apple platforms,"" Federighi added.

Apple also announced it will commit $1 million to local San Jose organisations to offset associated revenue loss as a result of WWDC 2020's new online format.

Developers have earned over $155 billion since the App Store launched in 2008.

With an active installed base of more than 1.5 billion Apple devices, WWDC 2020 will allow developers to learn about the new technologies and frameworks they rely on as they create new app experiences in areas including augmented reality, machine learning, health and fitness, home automation and more.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that travel bans enacted last week have helped curb transmission, but that U.S. citizens would have to make personal sacrifices and comply with government guidelines to avoid a “worst-case scenario.”

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Dr. Fauci cautioned, “Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.”

While the Trump administration has banned international travelers coming from high-risk countries and regions, such as China, Iran, and much of Europe, Dr. Fauci said domestic travel restrictions hadn’t been seriously discussed.

“I don’t see that right now or in the immediate future,” he said on “This Week.” “But remember, we are very open-minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public.”

The administration’s evaluation of the virus’s impact comes as many companies, universities and school districts are already announcing voluntary closings and suspension of normal operations. Last week, over a dozen states began to shutter public schools, and colleges and universities worldwide announced class suspensions and plans to move to online instruction.

In an interview with Brianna Keilar on CNN, Dr. Fauci said that progress was being made with companies like Walmart and CVS to improve diagnostic and testing capabilities. But he cautioned that disruptions to daily life were likely to continue.

Mr. Gantz responded witheringly to the idea. “Netanyahu, let’s not manipulate the public,” he wrote on Twitter. “If you’re interested in unity, why postpone your trial at 1 a.m. and send an ‘emergency unity’ outline to the press, instead of sending your negotiating team to a meeting? Unlike you, I will continue to support every appropriate governmental measure, leaving political considerations aside. When you get serious, we can talk.”

The delay of Mr. Netanyahu's trial set off a wave of criticism on the Israeli left. “We have the Italian mafia here, and how,” Yariv Oppenheimer, a former director of Peace Now, wrote on Twitter.

['Andrew Higgins'],‘Here I Can Be My Own Dictator’,"His readiness to join the Kremlin’s land giveaway has caused dismay among some like-minded critics of the Kremlin. Appearing last year on Ekho Moskvy, a radio station popular with Russia’s liberal intelligentsia, he faced repeated questions about how a dogged foe of the authorities like himself could join the settlement project.

“I am not supporting Putin’s program,” he said. “I am using it. I’m doing this for myself.”

Aside from going online to apply for the land and filling in official forms testifying to his readiness to develop it, however, Mr. Lunin has so far done very little. He has hammered wooden stakes wrapped with red plastic tags into the frozen ground to mark the boundary of his territory but has done nothing substantial to develop it as required by the program’s rules.

He planned to start last summer but, with only a tent to shelter in during a long and violent storm, he fell ill and retreated to his rented apartment in Blagoveshchensk, the nearest city. He said he will try again this summer and has grand plans to one day grow his own food, cultivate fruit and vegetables for sale, and build a two-story wooden house next to a small lake at the property’s edge.

To do this, however, he needs money.

With a monthly salary of 7,000 rubles, around $106, from his day job in Blagoveshchensk as a technician, Mr. Lunin gets by with support from his wife, who has a better-paying job at a medical institute. But even with their combined wages, they still have nowhere near enough cash to buy the equipment and materials needed to develop their land.

Unless he does something soon, the authorities can take back his property. To demonstrate that he is making some small progress, Mr. Lunin plans to build a small hut once the snow melts this year to shelter in and, he hopes, keep covetous officials away until he can save enough to start building something more permanent.

Describing himself as an optimist despite his dyspeptic view of Russia and its leaders, he said he learned long ago to never lose hope, or let officials get him down.

Raghda and Rafaa found new jobs, Raghda at Dasoqa, a coffee shop whose name means “ladybug,” and Rafaa at Blink, a community gathering space nearby.

Their parents have caved a little, but fretted a lot. They feared for the family’s reputation as much as for their daughters’ souls.

“Our dad says, ‘What if my family came and saw you here working, making coffee and drinks?’” said Raghda. “‘They’ll see your face!’”

To the sisters, that was the point. Raghda’s hair remains neatly tucked under a lilac head scarf, Rafaa’s under a black one. But their faces — sometimes people still do a double-take when they see them — are bare.

The lack of reliable public polling and free speech makes it difficult to gauge how Saudis view women’s changing status. But one study, from 2018, suggested that fear of social stigma may drive opposition more than personal resistance.

Given the grim arithmetic of the pandemic, several of those negotiators are likely to fall ill.

“It would be better to agree a delay now,” Mr. Henig said. “If June is the peak of the virus and it is also the point where we are going to say, ‘no further extension,’ then that starts to look like a lack of forward planning.”

Analysts noted that coronavirus could give Mr. Johnson political cover to ask for an extension, if that was what he wanted to do anyway. Last fall, the prime minister cited a law passed by Parliament as giving him no choice but to ask for the withdrawal deadline to be moved from October to January.

For Mr. Johnson, however, such a move poses a dilemma. Under the terms of its agreement, Britain would be required to pay billions of pounds to the European Union if it continued to have access to the single market and customs union beyond the transition period that ends in December.

That would be an acute embarrassment for Mr. Johnson, damaging him particularly with the hard-line Brexit wing of his Conservative Party.

Guyana in January began to export the first trickle of the massive crude reserves discovered off its coast, a move that is expected to transform the poor former British sugar colony into a petrostate in the coming years. A new term would give the president, David E. Granger, power to manage proceeds from those exports.

However, the flawed vote signals for many Guyanese a return to the political malaise of the 1980s, when the predecessor of Mr. Granger’s party ruled the country through a series of sham elections and with the support of the army.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/world/americas/guyana-election-winner-granger.html,NY Times,World,True

Still the beginning?

President Trump declared a national emergency for the growing coronavirus pandemic on Friday, capping a week in which the virus began to alter nearly every part of life in the United States. Cases in the U.S. have climbed to almost 2,000, even with sparse testing, and the death toll has risen to 41.

There are signs that we are still much closer to the beginning of the outbreak than the end. Our colleague Sheri Fink reported today that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have projected that in a worst-case situation, 160 million to 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected.

The projections suggest that 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds, in an outbreak that could last months or even over a year.

Those dire scenarios are not guaranteed to come true.

First, the House of Commons voted unanimously to suspend its session until April 20. Then, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held an outdoor news conference in front of his official residence, with journalists kept at a distance. After his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for coronavirus, Mr. Trudeau, who said he is in full health, has voluntarily isolated himself for two weeks.

The prime minister, members of his cabinet and public health officials both in Ottawa and in several provinces outlined a variety of new restrictions and closings during the day.

It also brought front and center the European Union’s dependence on Turkey to limit the movement of migrants toward its territory, as well as Mr. Erdogan’s willingness to weaponize migrants for his own purposes.

But experts said Mr. Erdogan’s mobilization of migrants and security forces at the borders with Europe could have backfired, being so provocative that it may have made European politicians less willing to make concessions.

The European Union in 2016 agreed to funnel 6 billion euros to organizations helping the nearly four million Syrian refugees in Turkey, in exchange for Turkey’s help in securing its borders with Greece.

That deal came after nearly one million refugees left Turkey for Greece, allowing them to reach the Continent’s prosperous north relatively easily.

He said he will try again this summer and has grand plans to one day grow his own food, cultivate fruit and vegetables for sale, and build a two-story wooden house next to a small lake at the property’s edge.

But even with their combined wages, they still have nowhere near enough cash to buy the equipment and materials needed to develop their land.

Unless he does something soon, the authorities can take back his property.

['Rory Smith'],Soccer the Sport Must Stop. Soccer the Business Probably Can’t.,"Soccer’s response to coronavirus has proved two things. One is quite how fractured the game’s structure has become, how unable it is to speak with one voice, even on an issue as pressing as its role in mitigating a public health emergency. Each authority has been unable to look beyond its own responsibility, to imagine itself as part of a greater whole.

That has always been the case, of course; it is what lies at the heart of the ongoing conversations about the global calendar, the endless struggle to fold the ambitions and the greed of Europe’s aristocratic clubs into some broader structure.

But it has been laid bare in the last few weeks just how rife the game is with self-interest, how little care there is for the sport as a whole, and how vulnerable that makes everything.

The crisis has revealed how reluctant organizing bodies are to inconvenience themselves and how navel-gazing club officials can be, wondering whether their players will be overloaded by makeup games when there is a possibility the season itself might have to be canceled.

The second is not unrelated. Nobody doubts that soccer — as a sport — is by its very nature a nonessential activity. It does not matter, not like guaranteeing that children have access to education or that an economy can continue functioning or that people have enough to eat. It is in the front rank of things that should be considered optional, easily sacrificed for the greater good.

But that is not how soccer the business sees it. Action would certainly have been taken sooner if there were not quite so much money riding on the sport. Every available solution would seem much more feasible if there were not quite so many financial — and legal — factors to be considered.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/sports/soccer/soccer-coronavirus-premier-league.html,NY Times,Europe,True

Given the grim arithmetic of the pandemic, several of those negotiators are likely to fall ill.

“It would be better to agree a delay now,” Mr. Henig said. “If June is the peak of the virus and it is also the point where we are going to say, ‘no further extension,’ then that starts to look like a lack of forward planning.”

Analysts noted that coronavirus could give Mr. Johnson political cover to ask for an extension, if that was what he wanted to do anyway. Last fall, the prime minister cited a law passed by Parliament as giving him no choice but to ask for the withdrawal deadline to be moved from October to January.

For Mr. Johnson, however, such a move poses a dilemma. Under the terms of its agreement, Britain would be required to pay billions of pounds to the European Union if it continued to have access to the single market and customs union beyond the transition period that ends in December.

That would be an acute embarrassment for Mr. Johnson, damaging him particularly with the hard-line Brexit wing of his Conservative Party. Pro-Brexit forces have already begun campaigning against a delay — suggesting, in a strategy that echoes some defenders of President Trump in the United States, that these calls were part of an effort to exaggerate and politicize the virus for partisan ends.

Arab citizens make up a fifth of Israel’s population and for the first time have come close to proportional representation in Parliament.

"['Mike Baker', 'Miriam Jordan']",Efforts to Control the Coronavirus in the U.S. Could Get Even More Extreme,"China took a series of relatively extreme measures to contain the initial outbreak of the coronavirus, including sealing off cities, preventing travel and requiring people to stay in their homes. Thanks in large part to those measures, the country has seen a drastic drop in the number of new cases.

“We wouldn’t go nearly as close as China in terms of making those kinds of impositions on civil liberties,” said Glen Mays, professor of health policy at the Colorado School of Public Health.

“As you get further down that list, the calculus the governor or state health official will have to make is, do the risks we face justify the economic and personal-freedom costs of adopting measures like canceling large events, closing schools or banning movement,” Mr. Mays said.

Washington State has led the way in recent days in adopting many public distancing requirements, but cities and states across the country have been imposing restrictions of their own. New York, California, Maryland and other states moved to limit most gatherings of more than 250 people. Ohio, Oregon and others have started announcing extended school closures. Private organizations have also joined the effort, including major sports leagues and Disneyland, which said it would close its theme parks in Anaheim and Orlando, as well as around the world.

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said this week that state officials are regularly running table-top exercises that simulate the pandemic becoming more severe.

“We have pandemic plans,” Mr. Newsom said. “They are the kind of plans that keep you up at night.”

On Thursday, he issued an executive order that allows the state to take over hotels should they be needed to treat coronavirus patients. His order also called for canceling or postponing smaller gatherings, if those in attendance cannot remain six feet apart from each other, as well limiting to 10 the number of older and less healthy people at gatherings.

“This is where we need to go next, and to make sure we fully implement those procedures and protocols to slow down the spread to get through a peak and to get through the next few months, so we don’t overwhelm our health care delivery system,” Mr. Newsom said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-washington-quarantines.html,NY Times,US,True

But even as farmers and slaughterhouses ramp up, producing food takes time. In the poultry industry, it takes 10 days for a chicken egg to incubate and hatch, and then five to six weeks for the bird to grow to maturity. For some chicken suppliers, the process takes even longer, depending on the type of bird.

Across the industry, “you’re talking about 50 days to get to a customer,” said Matthew Wadiak, who runs Cooks Venture, a chicken supplier based in Arkansas and Oklahoma. “Fifty days ago, we didn’t know this was even on the horizon. There was essentially no way to plan for it.”

Mr. Wadiak said some of Cooks Venture’s customers — like the Berkeley Bowl grocery stores in California — had quadrupled their orders in recent days.

“People are very short today. Retailers are short on products,” Mr. Wadiak said. “So we’re helping out where we can, and I know that we’re not meeting the full demand.”

It’s clear that the modern supply chain, for all its efficiency and speed, is not equipped to deal with this kind of surge.

This meant that he expected his fruit and vegetable sales to be slower, at least for a while. For people to go out less, and to spend less money. And it wasn’t just the virus messing with the rhythms of the city’s markets, many of which were already closed for public safety. It was the freakishly persistent rain. Why would anyone be out and about today, unless they absolutely had to?

The Coronavirus Campaign Just Started.,"“We are still largely people who need that sort of human element to it,” said Karen Finney, a longtime Democratic strategist who has advised Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams. “There is nothing that replaces in-person events.”

The premier in-person event in democracy, historically — voting itself — has also been scrambled. Two states, Louisiana and Georgia, are postponing their primaries amid virus concerns. Others, including Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona, plan to go forward with their elections this week.

But for the candidates competing in those contests, confinement to a campaign live-stream is a significant impediment.

The past four presidents, for their many differences, all distinguished themselves with an ability to excel in a room, either through soaring speechmaking (Barack Obama), rampaging rally (Mr. Trump) or a talent for insta-connections with voters in smaller, unrehearsed settings (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush).

Certainly all three major 2020 candidates are being stripped of some signal political strengths during the hiatus. Mr. Trump’s events are something akin to oxygen for him, rousing his base and supplying the live-action feedback and adulation he craves.

Mr. Biden’s best moments often come on the voter rope-line after he leaves the lectern, showcasing his empathy and charm — and his eagerness to shake hands, shoulders, anything in range — more effectively than his public remarks tend to. (Other flourishes, like his recent profanity-specked exchange with a man in Michigan, who suggested Mr. Biden wanted to confiscate guns, can also flow from these interactions, for better or worse.)

"['Reid J. Epstein', 'Katie Glueck', 'Astead W. Herndon']",Highlights From the March Democratic Debate,"How does the virus reshape the debate?

As the nation grapples with the coronavirus crisis, voters will be looking to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders for a sense of how they would lead a nation under extreme duress. Sunday night’s debate offers the chance for both men to take the cases they have been making in recent days onto the national stage after the epidemic forced them to pull back from large-scale campaign events.

Mr. Sanders, who has issued recommendations — including for the government to offer treatment free of charge and expand anti-hunger initiatives aimed at the poor — has also used the outbreak to push anew for “Medicare for all,” his signature single-payer health care proposal.

Mr. Biden has unfurled a plan of his own, as well as a “Public Health Advisory Committee” featuring prominent health care leaders, seeking at every turn to “offer a view into how Biden will lead in times of crisis as president,” as one Biden official described a Thursday speech Mr. Biden delivered on the matter. His allies argue that in times of crisis — whether it’s the coronavirus outbreak or, earlier this year, tensions with Iran — Mr. Biden is seen by voters as a steady, experienced hand.

His task on Sunday will be to communicate that image to the voters tuning in to the debate.

What Bernie Sanders needs to do

Mr. Sanders’s decision to stay in the presidential race after a disastrous showing in last week’s primaries was partly tied to this debate.

His advisers and supporters have pointed to it as an opportunity for him to fully contrast his ideas against Mr. Biden — someone who has had consistent flubs in previous debates. However, there is some disagreement about what tone Mr. Sanders will strike in this debate, given his slim electoral chances.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/democratic-debate-tonight-time.html,NY Times,US,True
['Conor Dougherty'],Arizona Boom Draws Californians and Changes Political Hue,"From 2012 to 2018, an average of about 250,000 people per year migrated to Arizona from other states, with the largest contribution coming from California, according to an analysis of census data by Susan Weber for the demographic research site SocialExplorer.com. This is why it costs around $1,000 to rent a U-Haul truck heading from Orange County, Calif., to Phoenix, but only $100 to rent one to go the other way, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

On the surface, adding new people and new subdivisions is the same thing the Arizona economy was doing as the real estate bubble inflated. But the nature of Arizona’s growth — and the kinds of workers it has attracted — has changed.

In the previous cycle, the economy consisted of “building homes for people who build homes,” said Scott Smith, a former homebuilder who served as the mayor of Mesa and is now chief executive of Valley Metro, the Phoenix region’s public transportation authority. The recent expansion, on the other hand, is marked by the growth of finance and technology companies that employ people like Mr. Jordan.

The number of finance jobs in the Phoenix area is up 25 percent since its pre-recession peak in early 2007, compared with 5 percent nationally, with companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan opening or expanding local offices, according to Moody’s Analytics. Technology companies have expanded their head count by about 30 percent in that time, while construction employment is still 24 percent lower than its peak before the recession.

“Our economy has been diversified like I have never seen in my three decades in business,” said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage firm in Scottsdale.

If construction and subprime loans were symbolic of the state’s last boom, this time the image would be offices like WebPT, which makes software used by physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists to manage billing and medical information. Over the past decade the company has grown from a handful of people working out of subleased office space in coffee shops and architectural firms to a 500-person operation with headquarters in a downtown Phoenix industrial space that used to be a tortilla factory.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/arizona-economy-primary.html,NY Times,US,True

It occurred to me that a lot of my previous work was invested in the management of feeling, and if the version of me I was writing about was confused or full of rage, I would find some way to process that emotion into something more palatable. This book on a certain level was about the tension between a performative emotion and raw feeling. I ended up giving myself permission to put more chaos on the page than I ever had before. A lot of queer people — a lot of people — are told to buck up, swallow your feelings, behave. And I think a lot about the cost of that. Suppressing hurt and rage — those are important social tools, and yet if we become champions at those social tools, all of that can come back and hurt us and have a cost on how we love, how we connect with our friends and partners.

In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?

At a certain point, the energy stopped and whatever I was doing did not really feel authentic to the experience. I ended up putting it aside for some months. I came back to it and pulled it apart a bit and wrote something more immediate. I flipped it into the present tense and introduced some fragmentary sections that might function on the page as prose poems. It felt like the book I ended up writing could be a container for irreverence and dread and joy and rage.

I can’t write any memoir without envisioning that “I” as a constructed thing. My education was as a fiction writer, and I started writing fiction because I wanted to escape myself, I wanted to be someone else. I started writing nonfiction when it became clear to me that that voice is also a made thing, and in some way it has some correlation to the narrator in fiction. The “I” of one book should be a different “I” than in another book.

Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?

I first heard Joni Mitchell’s music when I was 10 years old, and I thought: Who’s that? What’s that? It wasn’t necessarily the sound of her voice — which felt distinctive — but I knew there was something unique about how her songs moved. My sense, even though I didn’t have the musical tools to articulate it, was that she was making up music on her own terms. I continue to love her work. It’s the meticulousness of it, the loyalty to idiosyncrasy, the respect for emotional complexity, the refusal to repeat one’s own rules or habits. She’s willing to be an amateur with each album and try to do something new. She’s probably changed my life like no other artist has, and I think of her all the time. There are nods to her in all of my books — not just in section titles, but in patches of images collaged throughout that only the most rabid fan could pick up.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/books/later-memoir-paul-lisicky-interview.html,NY Times,US,True

Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate one on one for the first time on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders, who is staying in the Democratic primary race despite a series of defeats, has already telegraphed his strategy.

“Joe, what are you going to do?” Mr. Sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week, ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press Mr. Biden on, including health care, student debt, climate change, mass incarceration, immigration and wealth inequality.

Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.”

Here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise.

One of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that Mr. Biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like “Medicare for all.” Instead, he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a Medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for — a proposal that still goes well beyond the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.

“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.

The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”

Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005.)

But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.

In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joseph-biden-bernie-sanders.html,NY Times,US,True

The disconnect between Mr. Trump’s exuberant comments and the project’s more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about his administration’s response to the virus, even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress.

In the hours after the president’s remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely “in the early stages of development.” The 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.

Now, with Google executives eager to show they are working with the president, the company is racing to meet the promise even as they acknowledge that the debut of the website will be far more limited than Mr. Trump has suggested.

Dr. Simmonds said slow-growing cancers, like prostate and cervical cancer, were more likely to be delayed. On Friday, the first day of widespread deferrals, Swedish Medical Center performed about 20 percent as many surgeries as is typical, she said.

By 9 a.m., they finalized the decision to delay elective surgeries, and began developing their protocols and notifying surgeons.

The committee, which had been meeting regularly since the outbreak began, said its decisions were driven by the need to protect resources, like the protective gear that medical staff need to keep from getting infected. But the doctors also wanted to limit the medical and support needs that patients regularly require after surgery, Dr. Freeborn said.

['Kevin Carey'],"Everybody Ready for the Big Migration to Online College? Actually, No","One way to manage the problem of inexperienced online professors is to increase the number of students being taught by the most successful teachers. Scale is currently a big part of online college, because that’s where all the profits are. It’s why for-profit colleges got into the online game early, and why public and private institutions are rapidly growing their offerings now.

But scale requires time and money upfront. The only way for one professor to reach hundreds or even thousands of students is to embed the learning process in technology. The simplest example is recording a lecture that students can view online. But effective online courses require much more. Many campuses now employ full-time “instructional designers” who help faculty map out courses and degree programs. They also create learning modules, online exercises, virtual laboratories and assessments.

The designers are good at their jobs and getting better. But it’s an expensive and labor-intensive process. The reason that many colleges are signing away up to 70 percent of future online tuition revenue to private for-profit companies is that those firms offer the financial capital and expertise needed to convert traditional courses online.

It’s impossible to transform a college course into the virtual world overnight. Which means the students currently boxing up their clothes and laptops also won’t benefit from the advantages of technology-enabled personalization. Fully online courses are usually, in whole or in part, “asynchronous,” meaning that students can learn when they need to.

A parent with a job can log on after putting the kids to bed at night, rather than hunt for a parking spot to make a 10 a.m. on-campus lecture. That’s a simple but powerful kind of personalization, particularly if people are caring for loved ones who are sick.

While the popular idea of individual “learning styles” has been largely discredited by academic research, people still bring vastly different levels of knowledge, talent and context to the classroom, virtual or otherwise. The long-sought-after dream of technology-enabled education is to build machines that can assess these differences, react to them, and give students a better educational experience — personalized to what they know and need.

There are decades of research in this field, and many promising theories and tools, but as of yet no breakthrough technologies in terms of cost and student learning.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/upshot/coronavirus-online-college-classes-unprepared.html,NY Times,Education,True
['Eliza Shapiro'],"Coronavirus in N.Y.C.: Pressure to Close School System, Nation’s Largest","Dr. Theodora Hatziioannou, also a virologist and professor at Rockefeller, supports closures, but agreed that they would have to come with clear guidelines in order to be effective. “This doesn’t mean you roam around, it means you stay home.”

The potential domino effect of mass school closures in New York is staggering.

The mayor said on Thursday that the three things the city was most concerned about preserving were its schools, mass transit and health care, which provide essential lifelines for the city’s most vulnerable, in particular, and are tightly linked.

A public hospital nurse, for example, would likely not be able to stay home from work even if her child was home from school. And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

“The downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,” said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the Council’s health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving “reports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,” said Scarsdale’s school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday. “Preventative measures are only effective if we embrace and implement them as a community.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-schools.html,NY Times,Education,True
['Ginia Bellafante'],The Manhattan Private School That Tore Itself Apart,"Six days before Christmas, the headmaster of St. Bernard’s, the 116-year-old boys’ school on the Upper East Side, sent a letter to parents announcing that he would retire in the spring of 2021. For an institution profoundly rooted in its own traditions and protocols and rarely trafficking in the unexpected, the news had a jolting effect.

“After 40 years here,” he wrote, “I’d like to try something different. (Suggestions welcome.)”

It was those last two words that struck many parents — who at St. Bernard’s belong roughly to the demographic subsets of the have mores and the have everythings — as cryptic. Headmaster Stuart Johnson III was known as a man of purpose and passion, and if he were leaving on his own volition, the thinking went, he would have a plan — to study Virgil, to recreate Regency gardens.

Parents and alumni (who are in many cases the same people) quickly surmised that the decision to leave was not entirely the headmaster’s own, and this made them very angry. Mr. Johnson stood for something beyond the ruthless pursuit of scores, metrics and marketable achievements. He stood for the intrinsic value of erudition. What would happen if he was gone?

As the universe spun ever more furiously, St. Bernard’s under his guidance had kept to its own metabolism. While schools around the country were conforming to new ideologies and evolving ideas about class and gender, for example, St. Bernard’s remained steeped in mandatory Latin and French, blue blazers and penmanship — not Mandarin and coding and self-reflection. This was the territory it had staked among the incubators of the meritocracy, the many schools in which a child could be educated in New York for the approximate sum of $50,000 a year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/st-bernards-school-stuart-johnson.html,NY Times,Education,True
['Claire Cain Miller'],Public School Is a Child’s Right. Should Preschool Be Also?,"But researchers and proponents say that thinking about early childhood programs like public school is a useful frame. As schools close because of the coronavirus outbreak, parents are coming to terms with how much they rely on them as a safe place for children to go. The idea treats preschool as an investment that benefits society at large, as primary and secondary education do. Universal programs tend to have broader political support than those that are means-tested — targeted at people below a certain income. And they are simpler to run because people don’t have to submit paperwork to prove they qualify.

For early learning in particular, researchers say, universal options have educational benefits that means-tested programs like Head Start do not. Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.

On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”

A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.

“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.

Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool.

The Education Department released school districts from a slew of testing and accountability measures required by federal law.

But schools across the country were far ahead of the Trump administration’s advice. A cascade of public school closings gained speed nationwide on Friday, with the largest school district in California, the Los Angeles Unified School District, announcing it was closing, along with the San Diego Unified School District. They joined other large cities like Washington, Miami and Seattle, and more than a dozen states like Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Oregon, New Mexico and Michigan.

At least 21,000 schools have been closed or are scheduled to close, according to Education Week, affecting at least 15 million students. A majority of closings announced by school districts range from two to six weeks, which the C.D.C. considered “short- to medium-term closures” that would “not impact” the huge wave of infections that are expected in the next few weeks.

['Jennifer Steinhauer'],"Veterans Are Working, but Not in Jobs That Match Their Advanced Training","Veterans, particularly those without college degrees, are often pushed toward low-skill jobs even though their training and the culture of the military might well translate into other types of positions. A clear pipeline to those jobs, however, does not exist for veterans.

“The employers are saying ‘It’s not our job to train them,’” said Joan Lynch, the chief content and programming officer at WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign that focuses on labor in the United States. “So whose job is it to train veterans for the work force? The military? No; they teach them to defend our nation. Employers aren’t doing it, either.”

Many jobs require licenses and training for skills that veterans learned in combat, particularly in health care. Many veterans who acquired deep knowledge and specialized emergency response techniques, for example, would have no immediate access to the long credentialing process to become a physician assistant.

Ms. Lynch said she had encountered many returning medics who were unable to immediately translate their skills into jobs — even when they had privately tutored medical residents on skills like suturing — because they lacked a license. At the same time, those extensive experiences may not apply in other, often lower-wage jobs for which they are vastly overqualified.

“These people have about $1 million of training that the government has put into them,” Ms. Lynch said. “But they don’t have one credit toward a professional degree, and they end up being turned down for jobs delivering dry cleaning. It breaks your heart.”

Under the most recent Defense Department budget bill, Congress authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess a possible partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems in which veterans can earn credit toward a master’s degree in physician assistant studies for their military operational work and medic training.

['Marc Lacey'],How Poetry Shakes Up the National Desk’s Morning Meetings,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.

When the National desk gets together to discuss stories, it can be a grim half-hour. We dissect natural disasters. We reconstruct mass shootings. We delve into political scandals and all manner of domestic tumult. Recently, though, we added a new feature to our morning meetings aimed at inspiring us and boosting our creativity before we embark on another long day of editing the news.

We read a poem.

I got the idea from an unlikely source: my son’s high school English teacher, Anne Baney. During parent-teacher night, she explained how she reads a poem at the beginning of every class from “Poetry 180,” an anthology of contemporary poems compiled by Billy Collins, the former poet laureate of the United States. The room turns quiet when she reads, she told us. If she ever forgets to start off the day with a poem, her students remind her. They like it.

And, it turns out, so do we.

While there was some initial eye rolling when I first suggested the idea, Morrigan McCarthy, a photo editor and former poetry major, got it. She started us off with a poem called “The Book of Hand Shadows,” by Marianne Boruch. It began like this:

An eagle and a squirrel. A bull and a sage.

All take two hands, even the sheep

whose mouth is a lever for nothing, neither

grass nor complaint. The black swan’s

mostly one long arm, bent

at the elbow but there’s always feathers

to fool with.

“The magic of poetry,” Morrigan remarked, “is that it jolts your mind into thinking about a subject or theme in an unexpected way. That’s exactly what we want to be doing on the National desk: looking every day for smart and interesting ways to tackle the most important stories in this country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/reader-center/poetry-national-news.html,NY Times,Education,True
['Kevin Carey'],The Bleak Job Landscape of Adjunctopia for Ph.D.s,"Yet at no point did universities seem to consider slowing the flow of students into the Ph.D. pipeline. The opposite happened. In 1988, the number of doctorates in the humanities conferred was estimated to be 3,570, and it increased to 5,145 in 2018.

Tenured professors like having graduate students around. They teach the boring undergraduate sections for little or no pay and provide inexpensive research assistance. For many veteran scholars, training the next generation is one of the most rewarding parts of the job.

There was another complication. In 1994, a new federal law outlawed the widespread practice of requiring professors to retire at age 70. The effects of this accumulated as the baby boom generation aged. The oldest tenured boomers turned 70 in 2016, just in time to not retire and not create room for millennials hitting the job market with newly minted Ph.D.s.

Consumer preferences also shifted. Stung by ever-rising tuition costs and anxious about a treacherous job market, many students left the humanities for more job-focused majors after the Great Recession.

All of this resulted in a severe misalignment of supply and demand. Universities had spent the better part of two decades training more people for jobs that universities simultaneously decided they didn’t need, just as economic, demographic and legal conditions began further depressing the need for professors. It’s no wonder that many humanities majors are using their considerable creative and rhetorical skills to liken their job searches to various post-apocalyptic imaginings.

As competition for tenure-track jobs becomes more fierce, only the graduates of top-ranked programs have a realistic chance, and even they increasingly settle for positions at less prestigious institutions that emphasize teaching and service over research. For example, the University of Michigan’s English department is ranked in the top 12 by U.S. News & World Report. Of the approximately 50 scholars who have graduated from the department and won tenure-track positions since 2008, only one is employed at a top 12 department, and that is Michigan itself.

Senator Sanders’s proposed legislation would be a highly unusual federal intrusion in the way universities conduct their academic business, and would probably be attacked by the higher education lobby.

If convicted, he could face up to 53 years in prison. He has denied wrongdoing.

Kenneth L. Marcus, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights, said the investigation was one of the largest that the office had ever conducted.

Investigators reviewed 20,000 pages of documents, interviewed about 95 staff and students, and held a community meeting.

They found that patients and staff complained that during pelvic examinations, Mr. Tyndall made inappropriate remarks about physical attributes; that he would conduct pelvic exams without gloves; and in 2016, that the university failed to investigate more than 200 photographs of patients’ genitals that were discovered in his office.

Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate one on one for the first time on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders, who is staying in the Democratic primary race despite a series of defeats, has already telegraphed his strategy.

“Joe, what are you going to do?” Mr. Sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week, ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press Mr. Biden on, including health care, student debt, climate change, mass incarceration, immigration and wealth inequality.

Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.”

Here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise.

Health care

Biden

One of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that Mr. Biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like “Medicare for all.” Instead, he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a Medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for — a proposal that still goes well beyond the Affordable Care Act. He estimates his plan would cost $750 billion over a decade.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-issues.html,NY Times,Politics,True

Grynbaum'],How CNN Is Planning a Safe Debate (One Step: Six Feet Between the Lecterns),"Mr. Feist said that cleaners were wiping down doorknobs and other hard surfaces in the bureau “multiple times an hour,” with extra attention to areas that “a guest, a CNN staffer, or, in this case, a candidate might enter or touch.”

Sunday’s broadcast is thought to be the first presidential debate to be held in a closed television studio since the Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960, according to Mr. Feist. Those encounters, the first televised debates of the mass media age, took place at television stations in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington.

With only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders onstage, it will also be the smallest Democratic debate of the campaign; several earlier debates featured as many as 20 candidates and had to be spread over two nights. Timing rules will be similar to past debates, with 75 seconds allotted for each candidate’s response, though fewer zingers and zippy sound-bites are expected.

“Debates with two candidates tend to be more of a conversation than other debates because time is less of a factor,” Mr. Feist said. “While those are the rules, the reality of a debate with two candidates is that it’s likely to be more conversational.”

Sunday’s debate was originally planned for an Arizona theater with a large audience. CNN, Democratic officials and the campaigns agreed to move the location to Washington, reducing the need for hundreds of political aides, journalists and TV crew members to take cross-country flights.

The CNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, along with the Univision anchor Ilia Calderón, will serve as moderators. Another moderator, Jorge Ramos of Univision, relinquished his spot as a precaution after he believed he had been possibly exposed to the coronavirus; Mr. Ramos has no symptoms and has said he feels healthy.

The absence of a live audience will add an additional wrinkle for two candidates accustomed to the reactions of a crowd. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders will also be standing at their lecterns when the broadcast begins, Mr. Feist said, so viewers will not see a dramatic entrance.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/cnn-democratic-debate-coronavirus.html,NY Times,Politics,True

When it comes to preventing such disruptions, Mr. Bernanke said, “that is something, in the first line of defense, that Congress can do.”

The Fed did some lending aimed at nonfinancial companies — including through its commercial paper funding facility and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which helped meet household and small business credit needs — and authority for those programs still exists. For corporate bailouts, Mr. Bernanke said, lawmakers should be the first line of defense.

“It’s more democratic and accountable if Congress were to take the lead,” he said.

Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was President George W. Bush’s Treasury secretary in 2008, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week that one of the lessons from that crisis was that the executive branch might need more authority from Congress to take quick action.

“Notwithstanding tensions between the parties and between the branches, it may be necessary to give the administration broad authority and flexibility to act, within the parameters and oversight structure set by the legislature,” Mr. Paulson wrote. “Congress can’t design and implement every stimulus program or turn on a dime to give new authorities to the executive when facts on the ground change.”

Hal Scott, an emeritus professor at Harvard Law School and the director of the nonprofit Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, said the Fed must restore its ability to be the world’s most powerful lender of last resort. It was unfortunate that such authorities needed to be reinstated amid a crisis, he said.

“It would have been better to do it before the crisis,” Mr. Scott said. “When you get into a crisis and you do it, there’s a concern that you’re sending a panic signal — that we’ve got to do this, we need this power.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/coronavirus-economy-dodd-frank.html,NY Times,Politics,True

The Coronavirus Campaign Just Started.,"“We are still largely people who need that sort of human element to it,” said Karen Finney, a longtime Democratic strategist who has advised Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams. “There is nothing that replaces in-person events.”

The premier in-person event in democracy, historically — voting itself — has also been scrambled. Two states, Louisiana and Georgia, are postponing their primaries amid virus concerns. Others, including Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona, plan to go forward with their elections this week.

But for the candidates competing in those contests, confinement to a campaign live-stream is a significant impediment.

The past four presidents, for their many differences, all distinguished themselves with an ability to excel in a room, either through soaring speechmaking (Barack Obama), rampaging rally (Mr. Trump) or a talent for insta-connections with voters in smaller, unrehearsed settings (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush).

Certainly all three major 2020 candidates are being stripped of some signal political strengths during the hiatus. Mr. Trump’s events are something akin to oxygen for him, rousing his base and supplying the live-action feedback and adulation he craves.

Mr. Biden’s best moments often come on the voter rope-line after he leaves the lectern, showcasing his empathy and charm — and his eagerness to shake hands, shoulders, anything in range — more effectively than his public remarks tend to. (Other flourishes, like his recent profanity-specked exchange with a man in Michigan, who suggested Mr. Biden wanted to confiscate guns, can also flow from these interactions, for better or worse.)

The Sanders campaign has been perhaps the nimblest and most experienced with virtual gatherings and social media-driven events long before the outbreak, powered in part by the youth and tech savvy of the senator’s core supporters.

It would be the biggest test the sprawling and sometimes troubled government hospital system has faced.

The department is experienced in managing an older and vulnerable population, and in many ways, it could be better prepared than the rest of the health care system to take on the task. It has a surplus of beds in many of its 172 hospital centers and a robust number of special rooms for patients with breathing disorders. Leaders at the agency say they have a surplus of supplies that they have been ordering since the beginning of the year.

“Nobody has asked for our help at this point, but the American people should know we are ready,” said Dr. Richard A. Stone, who is in charge of the Veterans Health Administration.

Hawaii has taken a similar position, but the state Democratic Party said that a large majority of the Democratic voters in its state votes by mail. The party said it had already mailed out about 57,000 ballots and would be sending out another 15,000 to voters.

['Conor Dougherty'],Arizona Boom Draws Californians and Changes Political Hue,"From 2012 to 2018, an average of about 250,000 people per year migrated to Arizona from other states, with the largest contribution coming from California, according to an analysis of census data by Susan Weber for the demographic research site SocialExplorer.com. This is why it costs around $1,000 to rent a U-Haul truck heading from Orange County, Calif., to Phoenix, but only $100 to rent one to go the other way, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

On the surface, adding new people and new subdivisions is the same thing the Arizona economy was doing as the real estate bubble inflated. But the nature of Arizona’s growth — and the kinds of workers it has attracted — has changed.

In the previous cycle, the economy consisted of “building homes for people who build homes,” said Scott Smith, a former homebuilder who served as the mayor of Mesa and is now chief executive of Valley Metro, the Phoenix region’s public transportation authority. The recent expansion, on the other hand, is marked by the growth of finance and technology companies that employ people like Mr. Jordan.

The number of finance jobs in the Phoenix area is up 25 percent since its pre-recession peak in early 2007, compared with 5 percent nationally, with companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan opening or expanding local offices, according to Moody’s Analytics. Technology companies have expanded their head count by about 30 percent in that time, while construction employment is still 24 percent lower than its peak before the recession.

“Our economy has been diversified like I have never seen in my three decades in business,” said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage firm in Scottsdale.

If construction and subprime loans were symbolic of the state’s last boom, this time the image would be offices like WebPT, which makes software used by physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists to manage billing and medical information. Over the past decade the company has grown from a handful of people working out of subleased office space in coffee shops and architectural firms to a 500-person operation with headquarters in a downtown Phoenix industrial space that used to be a tortilla factory.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/arizona-economy-primary.html,NY Times,Politics,True
['Claire Cain Miller'],Public School Is a Child’s Right. Should Preschool Be Also?,"But researchers and proponents say that thinking about early childhood programs like public school is a useful frame. As schools close because of the coronavirus outbreak, parents are coming to terms with how much they rely on them as a safe place for children to go. The idea treats preschool as an investment that benefits society at large, as primary and secondary education do. Universal programs tend to have broader political support than those that are means-tested — targeted at people below a certain income. And they are simpler to run because people don’t have to submit paperwork to prove they qualify.

For early learning in particular, researchers say, universal options have educational benefits that means-tested programs like Head Start do not. Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.

On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”

A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.

“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.

Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool. Those who don’t are more likely to be Hispanic, from low-income families or with parents who did not go to college.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/upshot/universal-child-care-democratic-platform.html,NY Times,Politics,True
['Glenn Thrush'],"For Biden and Sanders, the Fight’s Not Personal","Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden’s ascent to the vice presidency in 2009. Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.

“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.

The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”

Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005.)

But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.

In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joseph-biden-bernie-sanders.html,NY Times,Politics,True

Vice President Mike Pence, a senior administration official said, learned only on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had been tested. At the news conference, Mr. Pence was left to handle questions about the president’s decision, some of which he did not appear to know how to answer.

Mr. Pence also indicated that he might soon follow the president’s lead. “I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician’s office,” he told reporters. The physician, he said, had previously advised him that he did not need testing.

Mr. Trump, who sees strength as the most important quality someone can project, has often equated illness with weakness. Over the past week, he had resisted testing, disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has recommended tests and self-quarantine for anyone who has stood next to someone who had tested positive.

Despite having the imprimatur of the highest level of American government, Dr. Conley’s decision not to recommend a test for Mr. Trump, or any sort of isolation, was at odds with the advice of other physicians, as well as medical experts on the administration’s own coronavirus task force.

The standard protocol is to ask people exposed to a known coronavirus case to stay home, to monitor their own health and to refrain from their regular activities for 14 days, and to get tested if they develop symptoms, said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

As a head of state leading the nation through a turbulent time, the president has a singular responsibility to safeguard his health, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. By letting a week go by before agreeing to a test, Mr. Gostin said, Mr. Trump “gives exactly the wrong message to the public, and puts himself and his cabinet at risk.”

But that decision was in line with the course of action Mr. Trump preferred — avoiding a test whose results could make him face a reality he might not want to acknowledge. It also followed a pattern of Mr. Trump’s career in politics: releasing memos and statements from medical professionals who are willing to say whatever he wants them to say about his health. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, Mr. Trump’s personal physician during the 2016 presidential campaign, later admitted that a flattering doctor’s letter he had released was dictated to him verbatim by Mr. Trump.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-virus-test.html,NY Times,Politics,True

Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50 employees, if it determines that providing paid leave “would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.”

Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus. Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)

The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some public health experts have called for — effectively paying any worker to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.

It also excludes “certain health care providers and emergency responders” from the benefit.

Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave. The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the outbreak.

['John Schwartz'],"Social Distancing? You Might Be Fighting Climate Change, Too","Here are four areas we may see changes in greenhouse gas emissions because of the coronavirus.

Transportation: Big Reductions

People are staying home and flying less. That’s good for the planet, Dr. Nicholas said. “For average Americans, the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions is driving,” she said. Anything that reduces driving, including working from home, “has a big impact on our climate pollution.” Avoiding air travel can have a large effect as well: one round-trip flight from New York to London, she said, produces as much greenhouse gas emissions as the preventive climate impact of nearly eight years of recycling. Dr. Nicholas was an author of a 2018 study that examines greenhouse gas emissions reductions in actions people take to fight climate change, and is currently writing a book about personal action and the climate crisis.

The actual effects on your greenhouse gas emissions of staying home will greatly depend on where you live, Dr. Jones said. For the roughly 25 percent of Americans living in the suburbs and another 25 percent in rural areas, cutting out a commute often means driving far less. But about 50 percent of Americans live in urban areas, and for those who use mass transit, avoiding a commute doesn’t necessarily cause much of a dip in emissions. The University of California, Berkeley, has suspended in-person instruction, and Dr. Jones said, “I commute by train and the train is going with or without me and everyone else, so I don’t think there’s an impact there.”

Food: A Big Maybe

Dr. Jones has done research into the relative carbon footprints of dining at home or dining out, but, so far, the results are fuzzy. “We don’t have conclusive evidence yet,” he said, citing the comparative efficiency benefits of eating out and the waste involved in making meals at home. “We waste about 25 percent of the food that we buy,” he said. If you drive long distances to go to a favorite place — like Austinites who drive more than 30 miles to Lockhart, Tex., for excellent barbecue, “that’s going to swamp the emissions from your food.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/climate/coronavirus-habits-carbon-footprint.html,NY Times,Climate,True

The Corps defended its policy. Without using eminent domain, officials said, the Corps can’t guarantee to Congress that the buyouts lawmakers have funded will actually happen.

And that would leave residents still at risk. Imagine the Corps identifies 10 homes for buyouts, but only three people say yes, said Susan Layton, chief of planning and policy for the Corps’ Norfolk District office, which is working on buyout plans in Florida. With a voluntary program, that leaves seven homes still exposed. “You’re probably not doing your best job,” she said.

The Corps applies a relatively simple formula to decide which houses should be condemned, officials said: It estimates how much damage a house is likely to suffer in the next 50 years, then compares that to what it would cost to buy and tear down the house, plus moving expenses for the owner. If the buyout costs less, the homeowner is asked to sell for the assessed value of the home. That price is not negotiable, and neither is the offer.

Many officials have balked, at least for now. Miami-Dade has yet to agree to evict residents, and New Jersey has refused. In the Florida Keys, Roman Gastesi, the county administrator, said he doubted the county commission would approve it.

The bloc announced an ambitious plan on Wednesday that would require manufacturers of electronic products, from smartphones to tumble driers, to offer more repairs, upgrades and ways to reuse existing goods, instead of encouraging consumers to buy new ones.

The “right to repair,” part of a wide-ranging policy package known as the Green Deal that was introduced this month, is the latest example of the European Union’s ambitions to promote more sustainable economic growth and to prevent waste. It extends standards brought in last year that put “right to repair” obligations on the manufacturers of some large appliances.

Such are the logistical complexities of the expedition, known as Mosaic, in which a German research ship, Polarstern, has been drifting with the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean since October with a revolving complement of scientists. The ship is expected to come out of the ice east of Greenland in September after gathering a year’s worth of data on conditions in the remote Central Arctic.

The Kapitan Dranitsyn left Tromso, Norway, on Jan. 29 with 43 tons of food, fuel and other supplies for the Polarstern, as well as a replacement team of researchers and technicians for what is the third two-month leg of the expedition. The resupply trip was expected to take about two weeks, but the icebreaker ran into trouble from the start, when a storm in the Barents Sea forced it to anchor off Tromso for the better part of a week.

Once underway, the ship encountered sea ice that had gotten much thicker as the winter progressed — doubling to more than 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, in places. The Kapitan Dranitsyn finally arrived at the Polarstern on Feb. 28.

After several days unloading the supplies and transferring personnel across about a half-mile of ice in dangerous conditions (a wind chill of minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or about minus 58 Celsius), the Kapitan Dranitsyn left for the return trip to Tromso. But calculations showed that it would not have enough diesel fuel for the journey.

So on March 3, another icebreaker, the Admiral Makarov, left Murmansk, Russia, with a load of extra fuel to intercept the Kapitan Dranitsyn on its way. Early this week, the two ships were about 350 miles, or roughly 560 kilometers, apart.

Bolinas at the time was as much a philosophy as a place, said Orville Schell, a longtime resident, former rancher of grass-fed cattle and author who is now the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. The town was notorious for its aversion to strangers — residents have long been in the habit of removing state signage — and for having curtailed development by limiting water permits. “We were a close network of people who got together around the whole land use question,” Mr. Schell said of the community. “Of the idea that you don’t have to be consuming on a massive scale to be an American.

Windowed doors came from dumpsters in San Francisco, and flooring came from a school gymnasium there.

“The first thing that tourists do when they arrive in Paris is to order a drink on a terrace,” he said.

But Mr. Fargue never had a chance to experience terrace heaters.

Their prevalence dates back to 2008, when a ban on smoking in enclosed public places spurred restaurants and cafes to install heat lamps on their terraces to provide smokers with some comfort.

In a city that last year experienced record-breaking temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, however, the terrace culture seems at odds with increasing concerns about climate change. Nor is the ban the only pro-environment move being considered.

Even though, in the short term, airlines have seen a sharp decline in air travel, and therefore emissions, demand is widely expected to bounce back eventually as the world resumes its embrace of flying. But in the meantime, the airline industry, an increasingly important contributor of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is citing the financial pain caused by the heath scare as reason to weaken longer-term efforts to fight global warming.

At least one major carrier, Air France-KLM, has cited the virus in calling for European countries to delay upcoming policies designed to curb air travel and reduce emissions. “In view of the coronavirus outbreak, we are asking governments to suspend the introduction of new flight taxes,” Benjamin Smith, the airline’s chief executive, said at the Airlines4Europe conference in Brussels on Tuesday.

Who knew you could take it, freeze it, and it becomes a totally different delicacy? When I first tried it, I immediately thought, “I have to write about this someday.”

Was there anything from your reporting you wanted to include but couldn’t find room for?

In the dispatch I mention that people in that region are frustrated by pollution caused by the oil and gas industry that’s becoming more active in the Russian Arctic. On the other side you have the fact that this oil and gas exploration brings untold sums of money to these regions. That was striking, seeing how high the quality of life was in these towns. That economic aspect is something we typically put in the forefront of stories, but I wanted to put the cultural and personal stories in the forefront here.

We write about Putin, politics, and will continue to, but we also want to tell stories of people. The food people eat is a core component of the human existence.

Does climate change have greater implications for stroganina?

That’s another theory I had when reporting this that I didn’t end up including. The colder it is, the faster the fish or meat freezes and the better the flavor.

He hadn’t really considered whether it was a waste of jet fuel. “Yeah, that’s a great point,” he said.

The targets: Mr. Biden’s plan calls for 100 percent carbon-free energy (essentially renewables or nuclear power) and net-zero emissions (eliminating as much planet-warming carbon dioxide as is being emitted) by 2050. Senator Sanders’s plan envisions the electricity and transportation sectors running solely on renewable power no later than 2030, and an end to the use of fossil fuels no later than 2050.

How to get there: Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders focus heavily on new regulations that would not require congressional approval, as well as spending federal dollars to incentivize the deployment of clean energy across the economy.

The main federal regulator overseeing nursing homes proposed the rule changes last summer, before the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of nursing homes to fast-spreading diseases. The push followed a spate of lobbying and campaign contributions by people in the nursing-home industry, according to public records and interviews.

The coronavirus has killed 13 residents at a nursing home in Washington State; dozens more residents and employees there have fallen ill. Seeking to prevent further contagion, some states, including New York, have banned most nonmedical personnel from setting foot inside nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which nationally have about 2.5 million residents.

Last July, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., set in motion a plan to weaken rules imposed by the Obama administration that required every nursing home to employ at least one specialist in preventing infections. The proposed rules — which the agency is completing and has the power to enact — eliminate the requirement to have even a part-time infection specialist on staff. Instead, the Trump administration would require that anti-infection specialists spend “sufficient time at the facility.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/business/trump-administration-nursing-homes.html,NY Times,Business,True

This is why it costs around $1,000 to rent a U-Haul truck heading from Orange County, Calif., to Phoenix, but only $100 to rent one to go the other way, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

On the surface, adding new people and new subdivisions is the same thing the Arizona economy was doing as the real estate bubble inflated. But the nature of Arizona’s growth — and the kinds of workers it has attracted — has changed.

In the previous cycle, the economy consisted of “building homes for people who build homes,” said Scott Smith, a former homebuilder who served as the mayor of Mesa and is now chief executive of Valley Metro, the Phoenix region’s public transportation authority. The recent expansion, on the other hand, is marked by the growth of finance and technology companies that employ people like Mr. Jordan.

The number of finance jobs in the Phoenix area is up 25 percent since its pre-recession peak in early 2007, compared with 5 percent nationally, with companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan opening or expanding local offices, according to Moody’s Analytics. Technology companies have expanded their head count by about 30 percent in that time, while construction employment is still 24 percent lower than its peak before the recession.

“Our economy has been diversified like I have never seen in my three decades in business,” said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage firm in Scottsdale.

If construction and subprime loans were symbolic of the state’s last boom, this time the image would be offices like WebPT, which makes software used by physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists to manage billing and medical information. Over the past decade the company has grown from a handful of people working out of subleased office space in coffee shops and architectural firms to a 500-person operation with headquarters in a downtown Phoenix industrial space that used to be a tortilla factory.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/arizona-economy-primary.html,NY Times,Business,True

Aramco’s future results will probably continue to be heavily influenced by the policies of Saudi Arabia, its main owner. Having failed to agree with Russia on new production trims at a meeting on March 6 in Vienna, the Saudi government ordered Aramco to ramp up its sales and production. The company recently slashed the prices it was offering to customers for its crude in April.

Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, hopes to offset the drop in prices with a rise in exports. Low oil prices and the deteriorating global economy threaten to undermine the prince’s ambitious plan, known as Vision 2030, to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil.

Aramco said in its release that in response to price volatility it would most likely cut capital spending to between $25 billion and $30 billion for 2020 compared to $32.8 billion in 2019. At the same time, the company recently announced plans to increase production capacity by a million barrels a day to 13 million barrels a day as part of the saber-rattling with Russia. A production increase of that magnitude will most likely require large expenditures on drilling and other operations.

Aramco said the earnings decrease was primarily because of lower oil prices. It also produced less oil because of restrictions that were in effect with OPEC and Russia. The company said it had earned lower levels of profits in refining crude and making chemicals, and had taken a $1.6 billion write-down on Sadara Chemical, a $20 billion joint venture with Dow Chemical.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/saudi-aramco-profit.html,NY Times,Business,True

Seemingly every aspect of American life has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, and the weekend ritual of watching a movie in the dark with strangers has been no exception. Most cinemas in the United States remain open, with the two biggest chains, AMC and Regal, reducing seating capacity in auditoriums by 50 percent so that people could leave at least one empty seat between them. But fears about the coronavirus kept the masses at home: Domestic ticket sales totaled about $55.3 million, a 44 percent drop from last weekend, despite three new films — “Bloodshot,” “The Hunt” and “I Still Believe” — arriving in wide release.

It was the worst period for movie theaters in two decades, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. The next lowest weekend was Sept. 15 to 17 in 2000, when ticket sales totaled $54.5 million and the primary draws were holdovers like “The Watcher,” a serial-killer movie, and “Nurse Betty,” a dark comedy starring Renée Zellweger. In today’s money, however, the 2000 weekend generated roughly $83 million in ticket sales.

But even as farmers and slaughterhouses ramp up, producing food takes time. In the poultry industry, it takes 10 days for a chicken egg to incubate and hatch, and then five to six weeks for the bird to grow to maturity. For some chicken suppliers, the process takes even longer, depending on the type of bird.

Across the industry, “you’re talking about 50 days to get to a customer,” said Matthew Wadiak, who runs Cooks Venture, a chicken supplier based in Arkansas and Oklahoma. “Fifty days ago, we didn’t know this was even on the horizon. There was essentially no way to plan for it.”

When it comes to preventing such disruptions, Mr. Bernanke said, “that is something, in the first line of defense, that Congress can do.”

The Fed did some lending aimed at nonfinancial companies — including through its commercial paper funding facility and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which helped meet household and small-business credit needs — and authority for those programs still exists. For corporate bailouts, Mr. Bernanke said, lawmakers should be the first line of defense.

“It’s more democratic and accountable if Congress were to take the lead,” he said.

Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was President George W. Bush’s Treasury secretary in 2008, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week that one of the lessons from that crisis was that the executive branch might need more authority from Congress to take quick action.

“Notwithstanding tensions between the parties and between the branches, it may be necessary to give the administration broad authority and flexibility to act, within the parameters and oversight structure set by the legislature,” Mr. Paulson wrote. “Congress can’t design and implement every stimulus program or turn on a dime to give new authorities to the executive when facts on the ground change.”

(The stock market rallied in response to some definitive news, for a change.) House Democrats also struck a deal with the White House on a sweeping relief bill later that night. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the package included paid sick leave guarantees and additional food aid and federal funds for Medicaid. The Senate is expected to act on the legislation next week.

The Fed is expected to lower interest rates again this week, hot on the heels of its emergency rate cut earlier this month. It’s yet another step in the scramble to reassure investors, consumers and workers, who are uneasy about how the pandemic will affect them and how much worse it will get.

Consumer education is a necessity for the alternative and premium milk sector: Americans are drinking less dairy milk, but it’s still the product they’re most familiar with. For A2, a New Zealand-based dairy company that sells milk that’s free of the A1 protein that many people find difficult to digest, health benefits are a way into the fast-growing but hypercompetitive alternative-dairy market.

Milk, said Blake Waltrip, the chief executive of A2, is a “repertoire purchasing category”: The average consumer has three to four different types of milk or milk alternatives in their rotation. As far as they’re concerned, it’s all just milk. Which means that these companies need to constantly be innovating to recapture consumers’ interests.

For A2, health benefits are an easy sell. “People care more about what the product does for them than about getting deep into the science,” said Mr. Waltrip. In Australia, A2 accounts for 11 percent of all milk sales, and the company claims that 70 percent of their consumers have no milk intolerance at all. Mr. Waltrip believes it’s because theirs is a “better milk,” but it also may be that consumers, long confused about whether or not dairy milk is good for them, are relieved to have a “healthy” dairy milk to buy.

Finding new ways to market and process milk has become essential for dairy farmers looking to turn things around. But some are thinking of making bigger changes to their production.

Either of the telescopes — the Thirty Meter Telescope, slated for the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile — would be roughly three times larger and 10 times more powerful than anything now on Earth. Working in concert, they could tackle deep questions about the cosmos. But they are hundreds of millions of dollars short of the money needed to build them.

Failure to build them, American astronomers say, would cede dominion over the skies to Europe, which is building its own behemoth observatory in Chile, and which will be available only to European researchers. The prospective builders fear an echo of a moment in the late 20th century when scientists in the United States lost ground in particle physics to European researchers, and never really recovered in producing path-making discoveries in that field.

Typically those simulated planets either eat their orbital retinue, or multiple sizable moons survive into adulthood, like the four Galilean moons of Jupiter.

How, then, did Saturn end up with massive Titan and a multitude of tinier moons? Using a set of simulations detailed Monday in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, a team of planetary scientists identified an explanation for how a moon like Titan could have avoided straying too close to its murderous parent.

That is extreme, but it may not be the worst scenario. Ophiuchus is relatively close to Earth, only about 390 million light-years away. If astronomers look farther afield, they might see evidence of equally outlandish events, said Norbert Werner, an astronomer at Masaryk University in Brno in the Czech Republic and at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, whose observations with NASA’s orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory helped lead to the discovery.

Black holes are best known for their ability to swallow matter and energy, including light, and remove it from the universe forever.

Paradoxically, belching black holes are the brightest objects in the universe, producing the fireworks known as quasars and other violent phenomena.

Galaxy clusters are the largest conglomerations of matter in the universe, containing the equivalent of trillions of suns. But most of that matter is in the form of intergalactic gas so hot that it radiates X-rays, which astronomers use to spot clusters far out in space.

This celestial event is known as a Moon-Mars occultation, and it occurs from some vantage point on Earth about twice a year, according to NASA. Skywatchers from much of North and Central America will have a front-row seat to Tuesday’s occultation, and those along part of the West Coast will have an especially good view, with a chance to watch the entire show before sunrise.

This pre-dawn meetup is a useful preview of how Mars will be central to space exploration this year.

Three robotic rover missions are expected to launch to the red planet this summer — one built by NASA, a second by China and a third produced by a European-Russian collaboration. The United Arab Emirates will also launch a Mars mission, an uncrewed orbiter called Hope.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/science/moon-occults-mars.html,NY Times,Space,True
,Coronavirus: Isolation for over-70s 'within weeks',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort""

Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus.

When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

The government is to release social distancing advice for the elderly on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods.

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35.

Mr Hancock told the BBC manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS, and hotels could be turned into hospitals, Mr Hancock said.

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care.

Earlier, 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Image copyright Nick Matthews Facebook Image caption Mary Matthews paid tribute to her husband, Nick, on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""best friend""

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"", following Mr Matthews' death at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

She said she and her family were ""currently in isolation"" until they received their coronavirus test results back and urged people not to visit them until they got the all-clear.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had recently returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, flying out on February 22 and returning on February 29.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are not being tested, with the government prioritising tests for those ""most at risk of severe illness"".

Tests will primarily be given:

To all patients in critical care for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

To all other patients requiring hospital admission for pneumonia, ARDS or flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

Earlier, Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would be told within weeks they needed to remain at home, with groceries and vital medication delivered - but he did not give details about how long this would be for or when it would start.

Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends so long as they stayed two metres - or six feet - apart from them.

All the UK deaths from the virus so far have been among people aged over 60 or with underlying health conditions.

The Scottish government set out its interpretation of the strategy, saying it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.

""What we're saying to them is, reduce your contact.""

The Scottish government has also published its guidance that gatherings of 500 people or more should not take place in Scotland.

Although it does not have the power to call off events, it has urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" in cancelling large gatherings from Monday to help the efforts of emergency services.

'Start making more ventilators'

Manufacturers including car makers, weapon makers and army suppliers are to be asked to switch their production lines to making ventilators for use in hospitals treating coronavirus - which can cause severe breathing problems.

Digger manufacturer JCB said it has been approached by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to see if it could help with the production of ventilators.

The company chairman, Lord Bamford, said it was ""unclear as yet"" whether it could assist, but its research and engineering teams were ""actively looking"" at the request.

The health service is to stop non-urgent surgery and implement a huge training programme to retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those who become seriously ill with the Covid-19 disease.

What is a ventilator?

A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide

Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery

A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy)

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment, but that many times that number would be needed.

Work is also under way to buy up thousands of private hospital beds to boost NHS capacity should it be needed and the possibility that empty hotels may be requisitioned has not been ruled out.

Mr Hancock earlier used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to liken the coronavirus crisis to World War Two.

He wrote that, despite the Blitz, the UK ""pulled together in one gigantic national effort"" and that the same must happen once more.

It came as the government's strategy was criticised by some scientists, who wrote to ministers urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

""Of course there is a scientific debate around scientific concepts but I want to be absolutely crystal clear, we will do what is necessary,"" Mr Hancock said.

An emergency bill giving the government temporary powers to tackle the outbreak will be published next week.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the government is ""well behind the curve"" in its management of the outbreak and urged No 10 to give ""clearer guidance"" and ""much better support"".

He insisted the government had not acted ""fast enough"" to tackle the virus, citing concerns over the availability of NHS beds, ventilators and staff.

He said he had written to Mr Johnson demanding a meeting and to ask what would be in the emergency legislation that is to be presented to Parliament next week.

Why and when should vulnerable self-isolate?

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks or so.

That's why it's essential people don't go too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self isolating.

But the officials recognise that individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

,Coronavirus: Supermarkets ask shoppers to be 'considerate' and stop stockpiling,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves

Supermarkets are urging shoppers not to buy more than they need amid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.

In a joint letter, UK retailers have reminded customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items.

""There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" it adds.

It comes after some shops began rationing the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely.

In the letter, the retailers say online and click-and-collect services are at ""full capacity"" and staff and suppliers are ""working day and night to keep the nation fed"".

The retailers say they are working ""closely"" with government and suppliers to make more deliveries to stores so that shelves are well-stocked.

""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without,"" the letter reads.

That was echoed in an email to customers from Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who said: ""There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked.""

In a plea to shoppers, he said: ""Please think before you buy and only buy what you and your family need.""

Speaking on behalf of retailers, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.""

The plea follows widespread concern over shoppers emptying supermarket shelves as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus.

Long queues were reported outside some supermarkets on Sunday morning.

Items including toilet paper, hand sanitiser, pasta and tinned foods are among those that have been in short supply.

That has led some supermarkets to limit the sale of some products, while Aldi has restricted customers to buying a maximum of four of each item.

Tesco, shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including anti-bacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There were empty shelves at a Waitrose in Sheffield

Meanwhile, Waitrose has brought in a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes.

Boots and Asda are both restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person.

Campaigners have warned stockpiling could hit the ""most vulnerable"" hardest.

Analysis

By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent

Supermarkets are used to spikes in demand, for example over the festive period. But they have usually been expecting them.

It has been clear from repeatedly emptied shelves that many shoppers have not heeded the official advice that there is no need to stockpile.

The BRC lobby group insists its members are resilient and there won't be long-term shortages. And supermarkets have adapted quickly. For example, Sainsbury's has told customers today that it has increased warehouse capacity and ordered more stock. Tesco is among the brands that will take up the government's offer of extending delivery hours to keep up with demand.

But with demand unprecedented for the time of year - weeks before the expected UK peak of the pandemic - this unusual joint letter from the major supermarkets shows they feel a strong message needs sending to customers. They will be hoping that the coordinated effort will help their strained supply chains cope and ensure everyone, including the most vulnerable, can get what they need.

Some food banks say they have a shortage of basic items which have already been panic bought by shoppers.

The government has said there is no need for anyone to stockpile items, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging people to ""behave responsibly and think about others"".

The government is relaxing restrictions on delivery hours for retailers to try to ensure shops remain stocked with basic items.

Deliveries to supermarkets are usually restricted overnight to avoid disturbing local residents.

Image copyright Julzz Ballard Image caption Shoppers faced a long queue at the tills in Morrisons in Kettering on Sunday

Environment Secretary George Eustice said allowing night-time deliveries would allow stock to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

Meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog has warned retailers not to ""exploit"" fears about coronavirus by dramatically increasing the price of protective goods such as hand gels and face masks.

"['Tom Burridge', 'Transport Correspondent', 'Bbc News']",Train companies seek bailout as coronavirus hits passenger numbers,"Image copyright Getty Images

The government is in talks with rail bosses to put emergency measures in place to deal with falling passenger numbers after the coronavirus outbreak.

Some train operators were already losing money but fewer fares will put even more pressure on their finances.

A senior industry source said fairly drastic measures might be required for train companies to survive.

At an industry meeting last week, passenger numbers were said to have fallen by up to 18% on certain lines.

However, another industry source acknowledged that the fall in passengers could be significantly higher.

They told the BBC that the number of passengers travelling through major UK train stations at peak times had dropped considerably in recent days.

Very up-to-date figures for the whole UK network are not known as many tickets are still not purchased digitally, so it takes some time for the data to filter through.

Under franchise agreements, train companies have a range of contractual obligations, which govern how many trains they run and restrict how much they can charge for tickets.

They are also required to make payments to the government to run services on parts of the rail network.

The number of trains, the price of tickets and the amount companies pay government are all calculated based on assumptions about passenger numbers.

But, with fewer people catching the train - as some companies ask staff to work from home over fears about the spread of the coronavirus - the ability of rail companies to meet some of those obligations is now in doubt.

Emergency talks

The BBC understands that train operators are in talks with government to renegotiate the terms of some of those contracts.

Train companies want the government to give them more wriggle room so they can keep operating services for essential travel for people working in the emergency services, even though broader passenger numbers have fallen.

Options being discussed are likely to include a reduction in the number of train services and flexibility over the payments that train companies make to government.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""We recognise how difficult the current situation is for the transport sector and, across government, we are engaging with the sector's leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51896169,BBC,UK,True

"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus: Some scientists say UK virus strategy is 'risking lives',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's nuanced approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

In an open letter, the 229 specialists in disciplines ranging from mathematics to genetics - though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases - say the UK's current approach will put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"".

The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune.

The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

The scientists - all from UK universities - also questioned the government's view that people would become fed up with restrictions if they were imposed too soon.

Their letter was published on the day it was announced 10 more people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21.

Meanwhile the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advised that measures to protect vulnerable people - including household isolation - ""will need to be instituted soon"".

Sir Patrick and the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, have said they intend to publish the computer models on which their strategy is based.

The UK's approach to coping with the coronavirus pandemic has been in stark contrast to other countries. The whole of Italy has been on lockdown since Tuesday, while Poland is set to close its borders for two weeks.

On Saturday the French government ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday).

And Spain has declared a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle the virus,

Measures 'insufficient'

In the open letter the group of scientists argue that stronger ""social distancing measures"" would ""dramatically"" slow the rate of growth of the disease in the UK, and would spare ""thousands of lives"".

The group, specialising in a range of disciplines, ranging from mathematics to genetics, though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases, said the current measures are ""insufficient"" and ""additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately"", as is happening in other countries.

On Friday, Sir Patrick suggested managing the spread of the disease so that the population gains some immunity to the disease was a part of the government strategy.

This idea, known as ""herd immunity"", means at-risk individuals are protected from infection because they are surrounded by people who are resistant to the disease.

Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease.

But in the open letter, the scientists said: ""Going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option.""

'Laissez-faire attitude'

The major downside of herd immunity, according to Birmingham University's Prof Willem van Schaik, is that this will mean that in the UK alone at least 36 million people will need to be infected and recover.

""It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths,"" he said.

""The only way to make this work would be to spread out these millions of cases over a relatively long period of time so that the NHS does not get overwhelmed.""

Prof van Schaik noted that the UK is the only country in Europe that is following what he described as its ""laissez-faire attitude to the virus"".

But a Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said that Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic. Our aims are to save lives, protect the most vulnerable, and relieve pressure on our NHS,"" he said.

""We have now moved out of the contain phase and into delay, and we have experts working round the clock. Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence.

""Our awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible.""

In a separate letter to the government, more than 200 behavioural scientists have questioned the government's argument that starting tougher measures too soon would lead to people not sticking to them just at the point that the epidemic is at its height.

""While we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about 'behavioural fatigue' or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,"" the letter said.

""Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it.""

""In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. Carrying on as normal for as long as possible undercuts that urgency,"" it added.

The scientists said ""radical behaviour change"" could have a ""much better"" effect and could ""save very large numbers of lives"".

""Experience in China and South Korea is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that this possibility should at least be attempted,"" it added.

The second letter called on the government to reconsider its stance on ""behavioural fatigue"" and to share the evidence on which it based this stance.

,PrEP: Preventative HIV drug available in England from April,"Image copyright Getty Images

A drug that prevents the transmission of the HIV virus will be available in England from April, the Department of Health has confirmed.

PrEP - or pre-exposure prophylaxis - is an antiretroviral medicine which, taken once a day, stops the transmission of HIV during unprotected sex.

The pill is already available in Scotland and Wales to people at risk of contracting the virus.

It is estimated there are about 103,800 people living with HIV in the UK.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the roll-out of the drug in England would eliminate new HIV infections within 10 years.

NHS England will pay for the drug.

The cost is estimated to likely be much less than the lifetime bill for treating those who already carry the virus.

The Terrence Higgins Trust, a charity that supports those living with HIV, estimates that about 7% of the roughly 103,800 people living with the virus in the UK do not know they are HIV positive.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'People think using PrEP means you put it about'

Ian Green, Chief Executive at the Terrence Higgins Trust, described the development as a ""game-changer"" for HIV prevention.

But he said more work needed to be done to ensure the benefits of PrEP were made clear to groups other than gay and bisexual men, such as women, trans people and BAME communities.

Sir Elton John, whose foundation supports HIV prevention and treatment, welcomed the government's decision.

""Taking PrEP prevents HIV from being passed on, which is truly incredible,"" he told the Sunday Times.

""It is the right decision for the UK government to roll this out more widely to minimise the spread of this disease so more people are protected - which is critical in fighting any epidemic.""

What is PrEP?

A pill taken daily, or on demand prior to having sex, to prevent HIV infection

If taken consistently, when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV, it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying

A UK Medical Research Council-run study comparing gay men on PrEP against non-users found an 86% fall in new HIV infections in PrEP users

Many in the sexual health sector say PrEP, when taken correctly, is almost 100% effective

It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk, including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed

Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections

But PrEP does have its critics, with some commentators saying funding it will lead to an abdication of personal responsibility, with men choosing not to use condoms.

Unlike condoms, PrEP does not protect against other sexually-transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea - of which the numbers of infections are rising.

In 2018, new HIV diagnoses in the UK fell to their lowest level since 2000 - 4,484 people - due to the success of preventative measures, Public Health England said.

The decline has been attributed to a mix of prevention methods, such as testing, condom provision, and the wider use of PrEP.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51897856,BBC,UK,True
,"Coronavirus: 'Future of UK aviation' at risk, say airlines","Image copyright European Photopress Agency

The UK's aviation industry may not survive the coronavirus pandemic without emergency financial support, airlines have warned.

Bosses at Virgin Atlantic will write to the prime minister on Monday to ask for emergency financial measures for airlines in the UK.

US travel restrictions will hit all transatlantic routes from Tuesday, further denting the aviation sector.

The government said it was open to supporting firms, including airlines.

In a stark message, industry body Airlines UK said the government's ""prevarication"" and ""bean counting"" had to stop.

""We're talking about the future of UK aviation - one of our world-class industries - and unless the government pulls itself together who knows what will be left of it once we get out of this mess,"" it added.

Airline bosses have been talking to ministers. Last week, senior figures in the industry were said to be ""livid"" that there were no emergency measures for the aviation sector in the budget, whereas most other sectors of the economy received billions of pounds of support.

""This is the most challenging period for aviation and package holiday businesses we have witnessed,"" Richard Moriarty, the boss of the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement on Sunday.

""The threat to the survival of some businesses is real the longer this goes on,"" he said. ""They will need to take very difficult actions to secure sufficient liquidity.""

The demand comes after the US announced it will extend its European travel ban to include the UK and Republic of Ireland.

The ban, which will begin at 04:00 GMT on Tuesday, will hit vital routes for the likes of British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian Air.

Meanwhile, American Airlines announced it is suspending nearly all of its long-haul international flights from Monday.

On Saturday, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advised against all but essential travel to parts of Spain as well as the whole of Poland.

The government said in a statement that it recognises the difficulties UK airlines are facing.

""We are engaging with the sector's leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers,"" it said.

""We have influenced the European Commission to relax flight slots and HMRC is ready to help all businesses, including airlines, and self-employed individuals, experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus.""

Under European law, if flights are not operated, designated take-off and landing slots have to be forfeited.

Last week, Virgin Atlantic confirmed it was forced to operate some near-empty flights after bookings were dented by the outbreak.

British Airways warned employees on Friday that the industry was facing a ""crisis of global proportions"" that was worse than that caused by the SARS virus or 9/11.

In a memo titled ""The Survival of British Airways"", the company's boss Alex Cruz said that it is to ground flights ""like never before"" and lay off staff.

Jan Vertonghen's family was held at knifepoint as four armed men burgled his home while he was on Champions League duty with Tottenham on Tuesday.

Police confirmed men wearing balaclavas forced their way into the house while his wife and children were inside.

The 32-year-old Belgium defender was in Germany for the second leg of Spurs' last-16 defeat against RB Leipzig.

""We have been supporting Jan and his family through this terribly traumatic time,"" said a Spurs spokesperson.

""We encourage anyone who has any information to come forward to help the police with their investigation.""

A Met Police spokesman said: ""Police were called to a residential address in NW3 at 7.49pm on 10 March to a report of a burglary.

,Coronavirus: Five ways hospitals will change to tackle the pandemic,"Image copyright Getty Images

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has braced the UK for ""quite extraordinary interventions that you don't normally have in peacetime"" to combat the coronavirus pandemic. But what are these interventions and how will they change the NHS?

1. Hotel room or hospital ward?

Image copyright Steve Parsons/PA Wire Image caption A Holiday Inn hotel near Heathrow Airport has been reserved by the government for people arriving from abroad to self-isolate

The health secretary said empty hotels across the country would help ease the pressure on hospitals that are filling up with patients.

""Some people are saying: 'Should you build a hospital?'"" Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

""Actually, we've seen that many hotels are empty so we've got ready-built facilities for looking after people.""

Asked about whether military field hospitals might also be used to spread the load, Mr Hancock said: ""I'm open to all options.""

He said he was more concerned that enough staff members and equipment were available to cope with an influx in patients, rather than worrying about where those patients would go to receive care.

""The critical thing is that [the hotels] need oxygen supply and the ventilation equipment - whether it's the invasive ventilation or just the mask on your face.

""So what matters is not just the space, it's making sure that the equipment and the trained staff are there as well.""

Hotel chain Best Western said it was considering turning some of its properties into temporary hospitals to help the NHS.

Chief executive Rob Paterson said Best Western would discuss the idea this week and ""would be willing to take unprecedented steps to support the national effort"".

The chain reported an increase in cancellations over the last month as a result of the pandemic.

2. NHS or private hospital?

The Labour Party and the GMB union have called on the government to use empty beds in ""plush private hospitals"" to ease the pressure on the NHS.

Downing Street confirmed on Sunday that the health service would buy up thousands of beds in private hospitals if they were needed to cope with a surge in patient numbers.

The government said ""negotiations"" with private healthcare providers have already begun.

But the GMB union is calling for these beds to be given to the NHS for free.

""This is a public health emergency, not a business opportunity for shoddy private healthcare chums to profiteer from distress,"" said GMB's Rehana Azam.

3. Ventilators made at car factories

How will thousands of new ventilators - machines needed to help patients breathe - be made quickly enough to cope with an increase in demand?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available in the UK at the moment but that many times that number would be needed as the number of people with Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, increased.

Asked if the likes of military engineers and car manufacturers would be asked to meet the demand, the health secretary said: ""Yes, we're talking to all those companies.""

""We've got high quality engineering in this country. And we want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators to do that,"" he added.

The speedy manufacturing might not stop once the UK has enough ventilators either, with Mr Hancock suggesting the equipment could be sent abroad to help other countries in need.

Digger manufacturing company JCB confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if they could help to make ventilators.

Chairman Lord Bamford said the British company - which cut production and working hours in February as coronavirus led to a shortage of components - would do ""whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing"".

4. Operating theatres converted into wards

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Non-urgent operations such as knee or hip replacements will be cancelled to free up space for Covid-19 patients

The cancellation of swathes of non-urgent - or ""elective"" - surgery will help to free up space, Mr Hancock said.

He said the sorts of operations that could be delayed ""in this emergency"" situation included hip and knee operations.

Operating theatres where these procedures are normally carried out are equipped with oxygen supplies, meaning they ""can be turned into wards"" for coronavirus patients.

This measure is ""one of the first things that we're going to do"", he added.

5. New (and old) staff

Image copyright Jeff Overs/BBC Image caption Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Andrew Marr how hospitals would change as the UK waged war on the virus

All those extra ventilators will throw up another problem - there are not enough trained nurses and doctors to operate them.

To fix this, Mr Hancock said the government wanted to bring recently-retired doctors ""back into service"".

But, the health secretary said, some of those workers would need to be trained up to deal with the specific needs of Covid-19 - which is a respiratory disease,

""We will be stopping some other activity, and asking doctors who normally do other things to retrain to be able to, for instance, use the ventilators.""

He would not say how long it might take to train people up but did say: ""We will do it as fast as we can.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51898207,BBC,UK,True
"['Dhruti Shah', 'Bbc News']",Coronavirus: 'I've had to cancel my wedding',"Image copyright Mike Eason

Holly Eason and her fiance Masakazu Yamamoto have been planning their April wedding in their hometown of Tokyo for ages but now, thanks to coronavirus, they've had to cancel everything.

Ms Eason, a teacher, couldn't risk her guests being exposed to infection.

She said: ""I couldn't forgive myself if our celebration became the cause of a serious health condition. I'm also worried that my dad and my brother wouldn't be allowed to enter Japan. We just don't know what the situation will be at the time and I wouldn't want to go ahead without them being here.""

She feels frustrated - but says safety is the priority.

The coronavirus only emerged in December but is now a pandemic, with countries implementing lockdowns and travel restrictions.

On the day the couple finally decided to cancel, their wedding invitations turned up at the home of Ms Eason's father, Mike, at his home in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in the UK.

He said: ""It hit home the effort she had put into organise the day but as I am over 60, she was very worried about putting me and the others at risk.

""My daughter has arranged the wedding day herself, when most have their mum to help with organising advice. Holly's mum died five years ago and unfortunately, I cannot offer much help from the UK.""

He said the family was now facing difficulty trying to get refunds.

""We cannot get our money back for the flights and hotel, so stand to write off approximately £5,000. I have tried to claim back through my credit card but despite being on hold for nearly 90 minutes (as everyone else is trying to get through too) they say there is nothing they can do.""

The family hopes to reschedule the wedding at a later date, ideally during blossom season again.

For Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi, their dream wedding in Italy was supposed to be the happiest moment of their lives.

But Ms Modi, who is from Harrow, London, said: ""In a matter of one week, our world was turned upside down, when the outbreak in Italy was announced.

""We were due to marry in Tuscany in about a month's time but now we're in a bit of a limbo and have no idea whether it's going to go ahead or if we should postpone or cancel.

""We had been planning for this wedding for nearly six months. We both work full-time and even though it has been a stressful and bumpy road, the only thing that kept us going was knowing we would marry one another.""

She said they had more than 150 guests from coming all over the world including babies, grandparents and elderly relatives but many were now too scared to travel.

With the response to the virus in the UK also changing rapidly, they also were concerned that it might be better to postpone if Britain eventually enters lockdown.

Lauren Maitland and her fiance, Charlotte Armitage, have their fingers crossed their marriage will go ahead at The Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire in May.

But Ms Maitland said: ""My mum has recently had a surgical procedure carried out on her heart and is recovering, while my granddad is 90 years old. Charlotte worries about her own parents daily too.

""Beyond that, we're nervous of large public gatherings being cancelled which would mean our ceremony couldn't go ahead, or indeed so many people having to self-quarantine meaning that the reception at Whitby Pavilion can't go ahead.

""We also have friends and family travelling from Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany and the USA. We're very nervous they won't be able to travel.""

They have taken out wedding insurance and have travel insurance already in place for their 10-day honeymoon in Orlando, Florida and a week on a Royal Caribbean cruise but Ms Maitland adds: ""With the current travel bans, park closures and cruise cancellations, we're certainly starting to feel anxious about what is going to happen with our best-laid plans.""

The couple, who live in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, say they are opting for a wait-and-see approach.

""More importantly, we remember to keep things in context. As important as our wedding is to us, and as excited as we are about our honeymoon, nothing is more important to us than the friends and family who we've invited to join us on that special day.

""As long as they all remain well and virus-free, then postponing or cancelling our plans doesn't really matter in the end. We just want everyone to be OK.""

The couple, who have been engaged for just over a year, were due to have a Hindu wedding with 500 guests at the Oshwal Centre in Potters Bar next month, with a civil wedding and reception to follow at The Savoy hotel the next day. The whole event was set to cost around £100,000.

Ms Deol said: ""There are a lot of things that concern us about the wedding going ahead. These include venues and suppliers cancelling on us at the last minute; the health and wellbeing of ourselves and our elderly and at-risk guests and the fact we have friends and family who were due to come from overseas.""

She said guests from Canada, Kenya and the US had mostly all cancelled already.

"['Jessica Labhart', 'Bbc News']",Coronavirus: How professional cleaners are dealing with the outbreak,"Image copyright Deb Lawrence Image caption Deb Lawrence said her cleaning firm has been busy as more cases of coronavirus emerged

As people try to protect themselves from coronavirus, the services of cleaners are in high demand. But how are those tasked with protecting others keeping themselves safe?

""It is frightening really,"" says Deb Lawrence, 60, who runs a cleaning business in Dudley in the West Midlands.

Ms Lawrence was part of a team which recently deep-cleaned a doctor's surgery after a patient was sent for Covid-19 testing.

The group had to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), and used colour-coded equipment to prevent cross-contamination.

""Thankfully it wasn't a confirmed case, which was a big relief,"" she said.

'Did I miss a bit?'

Her son Alex, 28, who went out on the job, said: ""It can be quite alarming for the public if they see you in your suit and mask so we try to clean at times when we won't be seen as much.

""When you get in a space where there's a suspected outbreak, it takes a lot more concentration.

""You're thinking about whether you've put on your PPE correctly, have you got enough water to mix the chemicals to the right ratio, have you squeezed out sponges and mops thoroughly?

""Then you're thinking - 'Have I cleaned every possible surface?'

""That's the thing you think about a lot because you've been trusted to go in and do a job and that job is ultimately about keeping people safe, so it's a big responsibility.""

Image copyright Alex Lawrence Image caption Alex Lawrence said deep-cleans take ""a lot of concentration""

Deb Lawrence said the job can be exhausting, physically demanding, and staff were under a lot of pressure.

""For example, a team of 15 of us went in to deep-clean a school and it took each of us four hours to clean our individual areas,"" she said.

""People don't realise that we're in the middle between the health service and the average person - we're the people tasked with keeping everyone safe in work, schools, at the doctors and dentists, so we take it very seriously.""

Staff at Mrs Lawrence's company, which employs 300 people aged between 18 and 75, have become worried about contracting the virus themselves.

She said she was ""conscious of the vulnerabilities of our older staff"", but would ""never put them in a situation that would put them at risk"".

""A lot of the girls have been worried, asking what would happen if they got sick, how best to protect themselves.

""If we found out they were at risk, we'd pull them out straight away.""

Ms Lawrence said her company had refreshed its training and protocols, keeping staff updated on the latest safety advice.

""It's such a new experience in dealing with this that we've had to be respond to things as and when they've happened too,"" she said.

Clean your entire home often, not just once a week

Pay special attention to areas such as the kitchen and bathroom

Touch points, such as door handles, push pads and telephones, are a particular concern

Use a good quality antibacterial spray or wipe as well as soap but be mindful of any allergic reactions your family members may have.

Stephen Hill, 64, from Norwich, cleans emergency departments.

""I'm only two weeks away from retirement and so I don't want to get infected,"" he said.

""I do clinical cleans - which involves sterilising a patient's area with chlorine - and the thing is, you don't know what they have.

""I don't feel particularly safe at the moment; we're just all getting on with it.

""I put a lot of pressure on myself to keep up high standards, but with cleaning things like touch points - door handles - they're only as clean as they are before someone else touches them.

""I know other people who are also due to retire soon and we're worried we'll get called back in.

""Even if I get the call, I won't go back - I have lung problems and ultimately you might be putting your life at risk.""

Izzy Hussain, 45, who owns a domestic cleaning company in Wolverhampton, said most cleaning was ""just common sense"".

""I think we all know what to do but we've just forgotten or taken cleaning less seriously as our lives have got busier,"" he said.

""We have a lot of vulnerable clients - elderly people and working families with children too, and it's easy to overlook things.

""With this scare - and it is scary - we've been wearing disposable gloves out on jobs to protect ourselves, but otherwise our standards have remained as high as they've always been.

""I would just say it's time to go back to basics and clean your home not just regularly but often.""

,Coronavirus: How many confirmed cases are there in your area?,"Image copyright Getty Images

A total of 1,372 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, with the country now ramping up measures as part of the second stage of the government's phased plan to tackle the outbreak.

Some 40,279 people in the UK have been tested for the respiratory infection so far. Thirty five people who tested positive have died.

If you can't see the look-up click here.

The following maps, charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are dealing with it.

1. The number of UK cases is growing

The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January.

While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase significantly at the beginning of March.

Since then, cases have been reported across the UK, with 232 new cases announced on Sunday.

Most confirmed cases are in England, which has more than 1,000. But Scotland has 153 confirmed cases, Wales has 94 and Northern Ireland has 45.

Confirmed case numbers for the UK are lower than other European countries, such as Italy, for example, where there have been more than 21,000 cases and more than 1,400 deaths, according to 15 March figures from the World Health Organization.

However, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said there are probably between 5,000 and 10,000 people infected in the UK at this time.

He also said that many people will no longer be tested if they are showing mild symptoms. Only those with the most serious symptoms will be given a test in hospital.

England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the UK outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.

Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 140,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 5,700 deaths.

More than half the cases - about 80,000 - are in China, where the virus originated in December.

2. We are in the second phase of the government's response

The government has published its action plan for dealing with the virus, which involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research.

While the emphasis has been on the contain and research phases up until this week, the country has now moved to the ""delay"" phase to stop the wider spread of the virus.

As part of the delay phase, people with even mild coronavirus symptoms - defined as a temperature above 37.8 C or a ""new, continuous"" cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home for seven days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.

Schools are also being advised to cancel trips abroad and people over 70 and those with pre-existing health conditions are being told not to go on cruises.

The delay phase could also mean further ""social distancing"" measures at a later date, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out closing schools at this stage.

Action to isolate the over-70s for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus is planned in the coming weeks, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed.

Government sources have also said mass gatherings might soon be banned to ease pressure on emergency services.

If the virus becomes even more widespread, the government may then decide to enter the third phase of mitigation, when health services are asked to focus on critical care and retired NHS staff could be asked to return to work.

3. People who think they have coronavirus should self-isolate

If you have a ""new, continuous"" cough or high temperature and think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you should self isolate for seven days.

If symptoms persist beyond seven days or if you get worse you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service if you are in England.

In Scotland, you should call your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. In Wales call 111 (if available in your area) or 0845 46 47. In Northern Ireland call 111.

,Coronavirus: Five things to help make sense of the week,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Workers put on protective gear before entering an infected care home in Washington state in the US

It's been a week of extraordinary developments, as the coronavirus has continued to spread across the world. The news updates are almost non-stop and at times it's easy to lose track. Here's a summary of what happened in the past seven days.

1. This was the week that shutdowns gathered pace

Halfway through the week, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. (Read what that means here). According to the latest figures, more than 125,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus in 118 countries. The total number of deaths is more than 4,600.

On Tuesday, Italy entered a country-wide lockdown, with police patrolling the streets to ensure people stayed indoors - the country's most restrictive measures since World War Two. Restaurants, cafes, museums and all shops except pharmacies and food stores closed, and tourists were told to leave immediately.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Catalan police officers stand guard outside Igualada, which is in lockdown

Elsewhere across the continent, normal life for millions was put on hold as schools and universities closed in Austria, Portugal, France, Denmark and Norway. Gyms, restaurants, nightclubs, libraries and museums also shut in some countries.

Spain became Europe's worst-affected country after Italy, following a steep increase in deaths. It declared a state of emergency and placed four towns in Catalonia in lockdown. Even the Real Madrid football team were quarantined.

It's hard to keep track of travel restrictions, with more and more countries announcing new measures on Friday. Earlier in the week, President Donald Trump banned travel from 26 European countries for 30 days, although not Britain.

There are fears that in some places, the true scale of the outbreak is worse than is being disclosed. Iran is one of the worst-hit countries after China, and this week saw distressing images of multiple bodies bag emerge from the city of Qom.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man stocks up on supplies in Rome

It's not just travel. Social and cultural events around the world are being cancelled. All English professional football leagues are suspended and artists including Madonna and Pearl Jam axed concerts.

And there's been a staggering knock-on effect on global stock markets, with shares in the UK and US suffering their worst day for 33 years.

2. A new normal emerges

In Europe and the US, the virus is changing how people shop, work and interact with friends and family.

The UK government said there was ""no need"" for stockpiling, but it seems people did not take notice. It was the week when shoppers began seeing empty shelves as people dashed to buy hand sanitiser, pasta, tinned foods - and the big one, toilet roll.

One entrepreneurial schoolboy in Leeds was caught selling hand sanitiser for 50p a shot to classmates - leading to praise on social media and suggestions he could get a call from Lord Sugar.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Empty shelves in the toilet roll section of a store in north London

In the US, prisoners in New York were tasked with making hand sanitiser to meet shortages. The state's governor said the gel, branded NYS Clean, had a ""very nice floral"" scent and would be provided for free to government agencies, schools, public transport and prisons.

Businesses have been sending their employees home, either after confirmed coronavirus cases among their workforce or as a preventative measure. In day to day life, people - including Prince Charles - are shunning the traditional handshake, some for elbow bumps or foot taps.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prince Charles opted for an alternative to a handshake when greeting star including Ronnie Wood

More and more people have gone into quarantine and shared their stories of loneliness and fear. Concern for elderly relatives, considered most at risk, has steadily grown - one journalist has described agreeing with her parents not to visit them for the foreseeable future.

People are finding new ways to cope. In locked-down Siena in Italy, residents were recorded singing from their windows - something that also happened in Wuhan and, centuries ago, during the plague in Milan in the 1570s.

3. Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands

Much of the advice from public health officials around the world is the same: wash your hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching your face and if you develop symptoms, self-isolate.

The WHO urges people to keep at least 1m (3ft) away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

It can be difficult for small children to take it all on. In London, a mother used magic marker to write on her son's hands to check how much her son was washing them while at school.

This week, the UK updated their health advice to say anyone who develops symptoms such as a new continuous cough or a temperature should self-isolate for seven days. Officials say they believe up to 10,000 people in the UK could already be infected.

Radio 1's Big Weekend is the first major British festival to be cancelled over coronavirus.

In the last week, two of America's biggest festivals have also been disrupted because of fears over the virus.

Coachella, set to be headlined by Travis Scott, Rage Against the Machine and Frank Ocean, has been pushed back to October instead of taking place in April, as originally planned.

The government is drawing up plans to ban all mass gatherings in the UK by next week.

Texas-based South by Southwest - an important festival for new artists from around the world looking for success in the US - has also been cancelled.

Tours are pretty much non-existent across Asia and Italy at the moment, with gatherings of more than 1,000 people being postponed in Switzerland, France and several major cities in Germany.

Glastonbury festival organisers have told Radio 1 Newsbeat they're closely monitoring the situation but the festival is still going ahead.

The festival's head of event operations Adrian Coombs said they ""thoroughly plan"" each year's event, and ""put in place all necessary measures to protect the public and maximise safety"".

And when they added Kendrick Lamar, Dua Lipa, Lana Del Rey and more big names to its line-up, festival boss Emily Eavis said organisers had ""fingers firmly crossed"" the event would go ahead in June.

""As things stand we are still working hard to deliver our 50th anniversary festival in June and we are very proud of the bill that we have put together over the last year or so,"" she said.

""No one has a crystal ball to see exactly where we will all be 15 weeks from now, but we are keeping our fingers firmly crossed that it will be here at Worthy Farm for the greatest show on Earth!""

No other UK festivals have been cancelled

The latest update from Festival Republic, which puts on events including Reading and Leeds, Wireless, Download and Latitude, says none of its events will be affected.

There's a looming sense of uncertainty for people who've bought tickets - but cancellations could also have a big impact on the artists booked to perform at them.

'Everyone's losing money'

""Everyone's going to be affected I think... everyone's losing money,"" Becky Hill tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.

The singer is due to appear at Coachella with Matoma and is currently supporting The Script on their European arena tour.

She says there are concerns of ""potential gigs being cancelled"" in places like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Brussels and Hamburg.

""The thing that's worrying is that insurance won't cover it.

""Festivals and shows are our bread and butter... it's the part of our job where you can potentially make some money.""

Becky stresses it's not just the artist who misses out on a day's work, it's a whole crew.

""If we lose shows that I've already booked a tour bus for and a band for and x, y and z... I lose that money.

""Us booking the band means they couldn't take another job where corona hasn't necessarily affected their work.""

'I hope fans know how awful this is'

Image caption King Nun were due to play some headline shows at SXSW

The impact of cancelled shows ripples through to emerging talent, too.

London's King Nun had been planning their trip to SXSW for months with five ""incredibly important"" shows lined up as well as meetings with ""a bunch of industry people"" to try to boost their profile in America.

""That's unfortunately fallen apart now,"" says frontman Theo Polyzoides, who estimates the band are set to lose ""thousands"" in cancelled flights and accommodation.

""I hope music fans know how financially awful this is for the band they care about.

""I also hope it means they'll involve themselves in local music scenes more than they did before.""

"['James Gallagher', 'Health', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus: What it does to the body,"Image copyright Getty Images

The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.

For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.

So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?

Incubation period

This is when the virus is establishing itself.

Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.

The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.

It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.

At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.

The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Everything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the BBC's Laura Foster

Mild disease

This is all most people will experience.

Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.

Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.

The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.

These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.

The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.

Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.

These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.

This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.

However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.

This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.

Severe disease

If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.

Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.

""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia

Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.

If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.

This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.

This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.

Critical disease

It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.

By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.

The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.

It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.

""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.

And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A patient being treated with an ECMO machine

Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.

This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.

But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.

The first deaths

Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.

The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.

The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.

He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.

He died 11 days after he was admitted.

The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.

He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.

"['Robert Cuffe', 'Head Of Statistics']",Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy,"Image copyright Reuters

Much of Italy is currently in lockdown as the country's tally of coronavirus deaths has topped 1,000.

The outbreak is putting the Italian healthcare service under immense strain. But will the UK follow this path?

On Thursday, Boris Johnson's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the UK was four weeks behind Italy ""in terms of the scale of the outbreak"" if not ""in terms of the response"".

Does that mean we're four weeks away from a similar fate?

Not necessarily. Here are three reasons why experts believe the UK's epidemic could be different from Italy's, and why the number of cases here means something different.

1. Different early transmission

The number of confirmed cases is not the same as the number of actual cases. It depends on how many infected people are detected.

The epidemics in both countries may be growing at a similar rate now, but early on the UK had more diagnosed cases than Italy. Italian numbers shot up on 23 February, leading scientists to think there was a period when the virus was spreading without being detected.

That gave less room for measures like tracing contacts of those who had fallen ill and isolating cases to slow the spread.

Professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth says that put the health system ""behind the curve"" in controlling the epidemic.

Researchers also warn that the Italy virus testing system has become overwhelmed and is not keeping up with new cases. This means Italy's figures could be falling further behind the total number of actual cases.

And as the UK adds more testing capacity, Prof Whitworth adds, we might see a ""jump in numbers"" - not just a result of greater transmission, but better detection.

2. Italy's epidemic is more concentrated

The pressure on health services also depends on where, and how severe, each case is.

There are good reasons to believe that these factors are different for the two countries. Since the initial spread, most of Italy's epidemic has been concentrated in the northern region of Lombardy, home to just over 15% of Italians.

Lombardy has accounted for almost 60 in every 100 cases in Italy. By contrast, the epidemic, so far, is more spread out in the UK. Like Lombardy, London has about 15% of citizens. But it has a smaller proportion of cases: just under 25 in 100.

So 15,000 cases spread out across the UK might not put the same pressure on hospitals as they would if they were mainly in one city or region.

The UK government is still planning for a time when the NHS will face significant challenges. But that may not be when we catch up with Italy's current number of confirmed cases.

3. More of Italy's confirmed cases are fatal

The death rate among confirmed cases in Italy is higher than in the UK. As of 12 March, the mortality rates among detected cases were 1.4% for the UK and 6.7% for Italy.

Prof Whitworth believes a higher death rate in Italy could mean that the observed cases contain a larger number of sicker patients. Italy has an older population than the UK, and the effects of Covid-19 infection have been more serious in older people.

That puts more pressure on services.

The alternative explanation for the higher death rate is that Italy's is an overwhelmed health service.

Don't relax quite yet

Even though our epidemic may not follow Italy's exactly, that doesn't mean the UK will escape serious changes to its way of life.

Epidemiologist Adam Kucharski warns against simple comparisons of case numbers and that ""without efforts to control the virus we could still see a situation evolve like that in Italy"", even if not necessarily in the next four weeks.

,Coronavirus: 'The worst bit is the uncontrollable coughing',"Image caption Andrew was infected with the virus when he was skiing in Italy

""The worst bit is the uncontrollable coughing,"" says Andrew O'Dwyer, who is recovering after being infected with the new coronavirus following a skiing trip to Italy in late February.

""I've had worse flu, without a doubt - but I wouldn't want to catch it again,"" he says during his self-isolation at home in south-west London.

Despite having type 1 diabetes, Andrew says having the virus ""isn't anything to worry about for me personally"".

He adds that the fever he experienced is ""no different to normal flu-type symptoms"".

""I've not been concerned,"" he says.

The severity of symptoms can vary widely among people. Those who are older and have pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) are more likely to become severely ill and can need hospital treatment. There have been 10 coronavirus-related deaths so far in the UK.

Andrew was told the virus wasn't circulating in the resort he was staying in, but 21 out of 25 people in his skiing group have since become infected.

On his return from Italy to the UK, he decided to stay at home and self-isolate as a precaution, despite experiencing no symptoms at that point.

'Debilitating cough'

Some people in his group fell ill within two days, so he contacted NHS 111, which he says was ""very good"".

""I got tested before I was feeling ill because other people had tested positive.

""I found out three days later I was positive. But it was over a week before I showed symptoms,"" he says.

They included a ""quite debilitating cough"" and a high temperature that kept rising and falling.

He says he found that taking paracetamol really helped to reduce his fever.

At one point he was told to go to hospital in an ambulance for a routine assessment.

He was checked over but didn't have to get out. Then he was dropped off at home again.

Andrew is now on the road to recovery - but it's been a long haul.

By the end of his self-isolation he will have spent 21 days at home, without going out.

He's also been trying to work from home but has found it difficult to concentrate.

""It's like climbing the walls. It's difficult to do a day's work,"" he says.

,Coronavirus: How will the suspension affect football in Britain?,"There will be no elite football played in Britain for at least three weeks because of the spread of coronavirus

Elite football in Britain has been suspended until at least 3 April as a result of the spread of coronavirus - but what happens next?

BBC Sport's Simon Stone has answered some of your questions about this season and the impact the suspension will have on the sport.

If the season is not completed what happens about promotion and relegation?

Stone: ""You would basically have three options. Declare the season void - and restart next season with the same teams that started this one in the same division, or have promotion and relegation, either using this season's positions as they currently are or having play-offs.

""All of these scenarios are controversial, which is why the preference is to finish the current campaign - it's just that no-one knows when that will be.

""There are nine Premier League games to be played, plus three FA Cup rounds, plus Europe. Given a clear window, you are looking at about six weeks to complete the calendar, using midweek games.""

Will Liverpool win the Premier League title no matter what?

Stone: ""I don't think we can say 'no matter what' because the option of scrapping this season does exist. However, everyone recognises that would be exceptionally harsh on Jurgen Klopp's men.

""Scrapping this season is not the option being thought of as preferable at this stage. The aim is definitely to end the current campaign at some point.""

Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool team are 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League

What is the likelihood of the season being completely null and void?

Stone: ""It is very much the will of all the leagues and the majority of the clubs for that not to happen.

""There are so many complications that come with making a decision of that magnitude. Clearly, no-one knows how long the game will be in shut down for. But whenever it restarts, I would think it will restart by finishing off this season.

""It is not entirely clear whether players will carry on training. We are in completely uncharted territory here.""

What happens to tickets for fans, especially season tickets - will people get a refund?

Stone: ""As with any situation, tickets are refundable if matches don't take place - and generally, clubs will look favourably on fans who can't make date changes that could not have been envisaged when the tickets were bought.

""However, some clubs have just had four or five matches called off, so it may take time. Season tickets are a different case. The season has not ended yet. At this stage, I can't see refunds being offered there. More clarity should come in the next two or three weeks.""

If coronavirus lasts for the next six months, does that mean no football will be played in that period?

Stone: ""It is possible, yes. In theory, matches could be played this weekend. It is the clubs who have made the decision today - the government said on Thursday that matches could continue for now.

""No-one, certainly not me, knows how long the current situation will last for. I don't see matches being played until the coronavirus problem has passed its peak point, which the medical experts said yesterday could be between 10 and 14 weeks.

""Given the medical advice, I don't think anyone in football seriously expects the situation to have changed in three weeks and therefore the present situation is much more likely to be extended than lifted.""

Wolves' Europa League game against Olympiakos in Greece on Thursday was played behind closed doors

What happens about player contracts if the season is not finished by 30 June - as well as other extra fees such as for appearances and goals?

Stone: ""This is a complex area. Obviously players whose contracts run beyond the end of this season will get bonuses based on the current campaign, whenever it finishes.

""However, for those whose deals expire on 30 June, it is a different situation entirely. In addition, the transfer window will be open.

""These issues will form part of the fall-out from Uefa's meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to outline the best way forward for the European game as a whole. The players - as well as the leagues - will be represented.""

Could next season be delayed - and if so, to when?

Stone: ""Yes. And as long as is required. If the current season doesn't finish until the summer, there will need to be flexibility about when the next campaigns start.

""A Uefa source told me yesterday that nothing was off the table. Anything is possible.""

Will there be any financial assistance to lower league clubs who will have no income for the next month?

Stone: ""I don't know if the EFL has enough money to start handing out bridging loans. Like most businesses, clubs will have to find a way round their present situation.""

Only games in the top four tiers of English football have been suspended, meaning matches in the fifth-tier National League and below are still scheduled to be played

Will lower leagues be suspended because of the risk of attracting larger crowds from other clubs?

Stone: ""It is a fair point. I suspect it falls into the 'cross the bridge when it comes to it' category. I can't see why a local side that attracts 100 fans should be stopped from playing.

""Junior matches will still go on also. There has to be a line drawn somewhere. It would be illogical to say 'no-one can play football'.

Why is the National League continuing?

Stone: ""To repeat, it is the Premier League and EFL clubs plus the Football Association who took Friday's decision. Government advice on Thursday was that matches could continue.

""The National League has taken the option to follow government advice. Notts County average attendances of more than 5,000, so there are plenty of fans who follow that level of the game anyway.

""If clubs get overwhelmed by spectators, I guess the National League may have a rethink but for now, for them, it is business as usual.""

What will happen to TV deals?

Stone: ""The big unknown is how the broadcasters react to this situation. BBC, BT, Premier Sports and Sky pay huge amounts of money to screen football.

""The latter three use football to drive their subscriptions. If there is no football, what happens to the subscription numbers and, in turn, their ability to pay the contracts.

""As with so many things, the length of time this shutdown goes on for will determine what happens next.""

What about payments given to clubs depending on league position - what will they get?

Stone: ""If the Premier League has its way, they will get the payments they are supposed to get because the season will finish. Anything else is guesswork at this stage.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51876162,BBC,UK,True
,Coronavirus elderly advice: How can I look after my older relatives?,"Image copyright EPA

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drop-off point to receive samples of the coronavirus for testing at Leeds General Infirmary

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

""We're all reaching that critical point now where we have to take stock and go, if I go to my parents I could be carrying something that could kill them. That's the reality of it.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Some people are wearing face masks although the government does not advise it

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The government has said there was ""no need"" for coronavirus stockpiling

Mental health charity Mind also has tips for those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Age UK's online advice adds: ""The government hasn't said we should stop going out or meeting up with other people.

""Most people can keep doing what they normally do as long as they don't have symptoms and maintain good hygiene practices like washing their hands regularly. You only need to stay at home and avoid contact with other people (called 'self-isolating') if you've been advised to by NHS 111 or a medical professional.""

More people in the UK should isolate themselves to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced.

So, what do you need to know about self-isolation and how to do it?

What is self-isolation?

Self-isolation means cutting yourself off from the rest of the world.

You need to stay at home, not go to work, school or other public places, and avoid public transport or taxis, says Public Health England.

""Common-sense"" steps include staying in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keeping away from other people in your home.

Ask for help if you need groceries, other shopping or medication.

It's OK to have friends, family or delivery drivers drop off supplies to get you through.

But you shouldn't have any visitors, PHE says. You can have deliveries left on the doorstep.

Do I need to self-isolate?

From Friday, everyone with flu-like symptoms - defined as a fever of above 37.8C or a persistent cough - is being asked to stay at home for at least seven days.

Anyone who has travelled to an affected area, or who has been in close contact with an infected person, had already been asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

Spending 15 minutes within 2m (6ft) of someone with the virus, or having face-to-face contact, is judged as close contact and a significant risk.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from the main affected areas and some other countries has been issued by the government. Full details of the countries concerned and whether you need to self-isolate are available here.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

The Covid-19 disease can cause a fever, cough and breathing problems. It takes five days on average for people to start showing the symptoms.

What if someone self-isolating shares a home?

If you are self-isolating and share a kitchen, try to avoid using it when other people are there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Clean all the surfaces at home with household cleaning products daily.

Although you might not be able to entirely separate yourself from family members or flatmates, the advice is to limit contact as much as possible.

If possible stay at least 2m (6ft) from other people you live with and sleep alone. Keep away from vulnerable people.

People living with someone in isolation should wash their hands often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds - especially after coming into contact with them.

You shouldn't share towels, toiletries or other household items with someone in isolation and they should have a separate bathroom. If that is not possible, the isolated person should use the bathroom last, cleaning it thoroughly afterwards if they are able.

Any rubbish that the isolated person has been in contact with should be double-bagged and kept. If the person tests positive, you will be told what to do with their waste.

Will I still get paid?

Workers will get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, not the fourth, to help contain coronavirus, the prime minister has said.

This means that people who have to self-isolate or who are ill would get an extra £40 to cover the first four days. This would take it up to its usual rate of £94.25 per week.

Many casual or agency workers may also be entitled to sick pay but self-employed people are not. Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick pay and should ask their employer.

In the meantime, the government says you can claim universal credit or employment and support allowance if you're prevented from working for public health reasons.

If you need to care for a relative or your child's school is closed and you need to look after them at short notice, your employer must give you time off, but it may be unpaid.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,BBC,UK,True
"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']",Coronavirus: What next in the UK coronavirus fight?,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

,Coronavirus: Australia orders all arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Domestic flights will not be affected by the new measures, the Australian government says

Australia's prime minister has ordered a 14-day self-isolation for anyone arriving in the country to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus.

""This is very important,"" Scott Morrison said at a briefing, adding that the measure would take effect from midnight on Sunday (13:00 GMT).

The measures mirror those announced by New Zealand on Saturday.

Foreign cruise liners will also be banned from docking in Australia for 30 days, but schools will remain open.

Australia has reported nearly 250 confirmed cases, with three deaths.

What did Scott Morrison say?

The prime minister announced the measures following a cabinet meeting on the coronavirus crisis.

""This is very important, what we've seen in recent weeks is more countries having issues with the virus and that means the source of some of those transmissions are coming from more and more countries,"" he said at the briefing in Sydney.

""We know that the virus cannot be absolutely stopped - no-one can do that - but we can slow the spread.

""And we anticipate that will be our task over the next six months.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Scott Morrison said the cabinet would meet again on Tuesday to discuss possible further measures

He urged people to practise more ""social distancing"", including not shaking hands.

Mr Morrison said that despite all the changes he hoped Australians would not lose their ""sense of Australianness"".

Appearing alongside him, Australia's chief medical officer Brendan Murphy admitted that these were ""difficult times"" for the country.

He called on Australians to be sensible when buying necessities, warning against panic buying.

Holly Eason and her fiance Masakazu Yamamoto have been planning their April wedding in their hometown of Tokyo for ages but now, thanks to coronavirus, they've had to cancel everything.

Ms Eason, a teacher, couldn't risk her guests being exposed to infection.

She said: ""I couldn't forgive myself if our celebration became the cause of a serious health condition. I'm also worried that my dad and my brother wouldn't be allowed to enter Japan. We just don't know what the situation will be at the time and I wouldn't want to go ahead without them being here.""

She feels frustrated - but says safety is the priority.

The coronavirus only emerged in December but is now a pandemic, with countries implementing lockdowns and travel restrictions.

On the day the couple finally decided to cancel, their wedding invitations turned up at the home of Ms Eason's father, Mike, at his home in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in the UK.

He said: ""It hit home the effort she had put into organise the day but as I am over 60, she was very worried about putting me and the others at risk.

""My daughter has arranged the wedding day herself, when most have their mum to help with organising advice. Holly's mum died five years ago and unfortunately, I cannot offer much help from the UK.""

He said the family was now facing difficulty trying to get refunds.

""We cannot get our money back for the flights and hotel, so stand to write off approximately £5,000. I have tried to claim back through my credit card but despite being on hold for nearly 90 minutes (as everyone else is trying to get through too) they say there is nothing they can do.""

The family hopes to reschedule the wedding at a later date, ideally during blossom season again.

But Ms Modi, who is from Harrow, London, said: ""In a matter of one week, our world was turned upside down, when the outbreak in Italy was announced.

""We were due to marry in Tuscany in about a month's time but now we're in a bit of a limbo and have no idea whether it's going to go ahead or if we should postpone or cancel.

""We had been planning for this wedding for nearly six months. We both work full-time and even though it has been a stressful and bumpy road, the only thing that kept us going was knowing we would marry one another.""

She said they had more than 150 guests from coming all over the world including babies, grandparents and elderly relatives but many were now too scared to travel.

With the response to the virus in the UK also changing rapidly, they also were concerned that it might be better to postpone if Britain eventually enters lockdown.

Lauren Maitland and her fiance, Charlotte Armitage, have their fingers crossed their marriage will go ahead at The Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire in May.

But Ms Maitland said: ""My mum has recently had a surgical procedure carried out on her heart and is recovering, while my granddad is 90 years old. Charlotte worries about her own parents daily too.

""Beyond that, we're nervous of large public gatherings being cancelled which would mean our ceremony couldn't go ahead, or indeed so many people having to self-quarantine meaning that the reception at Whitby Pavilion can't go ahead.

""We also have friends and family travelling from Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany and the USA. We're very nervous they won't be able to travel.""

They have taken out wedding insurance and have travel insurance already in place for their 10-day honeymoon in Orlando, Florida and a week on a Royal Caribbean cruise but Ms Maitland adds: ""With the current travel bans, park closures and cruise cancellations, we're certainly starting to feel anxious about what is going to happen with our best-laid plans.""

The couple, who live in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, say they are opting for a wait-and-see approach.

""More importantly, we remember to keep things in context. As important as our wedding is to us, and as excited as we are about our honeymoon, nothing is more important to us than the friends and family who we've invited to join us on that special day.

""As long as they all remain well and virus-free, then postponing or cancelling our plans doesn't really matter in the end. We just want everyone to be OK.""

"['M Ilyas Khan', 'Bbc News']",Why a media mogul was arrested in Pakistan,"Image copyright Geo Image caption Shakilur Rahman has been arrested and remanded in custody for 12 days

The authorities in Pakistan have arrested one of the country's leading media magnates on charges he illegally obtained government land more than 30 years ago.

Mir Shakilur Rahman is the editor-in-chief of the Jang group which owns some of Pakistan's most widely circulated newspapers, as well as the popular Geo television network.

The arrest is being seen by journalists and human rights activists as more evidence that free media and political dissent are being silenced in Pakistan.

Mr Rahman, who denies the accusations against him, appeared in court on Friday and was remanded in custody. He has not been formally charged.

What was Mr Rahman detained for?

The charges against him relating to the purchase of several plots of land in Lahore go back to 1986.

Image copyright Jang Image caption Shakilur Rahman owns one of Pakistan's largest media groups

Pakistan's anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), has alleged that in that year, when future PM Nawaz Sharif was chief minister of Punjab province, he let Mr Rahman illegally acquire more government-owned-land than he was allowed by law.

Dawn newspaper quoted a NAB official as saying Mr Rahman was entitled to four acres of land under the Lahore Development Authority's ""land exemption policy"", but he acquired more than 13 acres.

NAB says this was illegal and amounted to a political bribe.

Mr Rahman says he bought the land from a private party and paid all the necessary taxes and duties, for which he has documents. He also says the purchase is a civil matter and therefore beyond the writ of an anti-crime agency like NAB.

Is that what it's really about?

Irrespective of the merits of the case, many doubt NAB is carrying out its duties honestly. It often takes action against those who question government policies.

The arrest has triggered widespread criticism from journalists' bodies, rights groups and the political opposition.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has expressed ""deep concern"" over the arrest.

Image copyright AAMIR QURESHI/AFP Image caption Jang has more on-the-ground reporters across the country than any other media group

""There remains a strong suspicion that such actions by NAB are selective, arbitrary and politically motivated,"" HRCP tweeted. ""The journalist community sees this as yet another attempt to gag a beleaguered independent press.""

The Pakistan Broadcasters' Association (PBA) pointed out that ""arresting the editor-in-chief of a media house while the case is still under inquiry… appears to be an attempt at harassment"".

Mr Rahman's daughter, Anamta, called the arrest ""illegal, even by NAB's rules"".

""This is a fight for freedom of media,"" she told the BBC. ""Today it's the editor-in-chief of Jang - tomorrow it can be anyone.""

Jang Group is Pakistan's largest media house, with more on-the-ground reporters across the country than anyone else, giving it a clear edge in Pakistan's increasingly competitive media environment.

In recent months, top anchors of its Geo television network have given government officials a hard time in interviews on a number of occasions.

Requesting anonymity, a veteran journalist in Lahore told the BBC that while there may be some truth in NAB's allegations, ""there's no doubt it's a selective move because evidence of illegal financial activities by owners of the so-called 'friendly' media have also been cropping up from time to time but NAB doesn't seem to be bothered"".

How free is the press in Pakistan?

Not very - the country comes way down press freedom indexes. The media has come under increased censorship since 2018 when the military was accused of rigging national elections to bring Prime Minister Imran Khan's PTI party to power.

But backdoor moves to quell media voices had begun much earlier.

In 2014, a top Geo talk show host Hamid Mir was shot and badly wounded.

Image caption Hamid Mir said the ISI spy agency was behind the 2014 attack on him

No-one was ever brought to justice for the attack, and many suspected he was being punished for his vigorous coverage of missing persons in Balochistan province, where the army has fought an armed separatist insurgency for more than a decade.

Most disappearances are blamed on the military. Pakistan's media have stopped covering the issue.

In 2017, a number of social media bloggers critical of religious groups and Pakistan's powerful military went missing for several weeks. They were released afterwards, and most went abroad.

The following year, a well-known journalist and social media activist, Taha Siddiqui, who had been warned by the military authorities a number of times, was attacked on an Islamabad road in broad daylight.

He was able to escape from the scene but has since left the country and is living in France.

Since 2018, the media has come under a more comprehensive censorship.

This includes threats to individual journalists, and briefly or completely shutting TV channels or influencing cable operators to demote them in the channels list so fewer viewers find them.

How successful has NAB been in fighting corruption?

The bureau was founded in 2000 by Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf to go after corrupt politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.

But it was largely seen as an attempt by the military government to clip the wings of the two largest political parties at the time - the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of Nawaz Sharif, which Pervez Musharraf had overthrown in an army coup a year earlier, and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).

During the mid-2000s, NAB found ways to drop corruption charges against all those politicians who quit these two parties and joined the one led by Gen Musharraf or allied with it.

Since the controversial election of 2018 that brought Imran Khan to power, the agency has arrested opposition politicians and kept them in custody for prolonged periods.

Government opponents say evidence has yet to be produced that would stand the test of law in a court.

,Farooq Abdullah: Kashmir leader released from seven-month detention,"Image copyright Getty Images

Indian authorities have announced the release of a veteran Kashmiri MP and former chief minister who had been in detention for seven months.

The order did not give any reason for Farooq Abdullah's release.

He said he was ""grateful"" to all those who fought for his freedom, and called for the release of other detainees.

He was among thousands of local leaders put under house arrest a day before the disputed region was stripped of its semi-autonomous status in August.

The government deployed tens of thousands of troops to quell unrest and enforced a crackdown on communications.

Mr Abdullah's detention under the controversial Public Safety Act (PSA) had generated debate, especially as he is an MP. Days ago, eight opposition parties wrote a letter to the government, demanding his release along with other Kashmiri leaders.

The joint resolution warned that ""democratic dissent is being muzzled"" in the state.

Two other former chief ministers - including Mr Abdullah's son Omar and Mehbooba Mufti - are still in detention.

Thousands of others, including political party workers, activists and lawyers are also in custody, with many taken to jails in cities outside the region.

The government said the move, decried by critics as draconian, was necessary to maintain law and public order in the region. It also moved to block internet and mobile connectivity in the region - these have only been partially restored.

A five-time chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir, Mr Abdullah was widely considered to be a ""pro-India"" politician in the state.

Both India and Pakistan claim the region in its entirety, but control only parts of it.

When he was first placed under house arrest, MPs demanded an explanation as the procedure is to inform parliament if a member of the house is to be arrested.

This prompted Home Minister Amit Shah to tell the house that Mr Abdullah was ""not detained or arrested"".

In one of his last public interviews since then, Mr Abdullah gave an emotional television interview where he accused Mr Shah of lying.

""Why would I stay inside my house on my own will when my state is being burnt, when my people are being executed in jails? This is not the India I believe in,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51869134,BBC,Asia,True

How have gun laws changed?

Immediately after the attacks, Ms Ardern said the government would bring in laws to make it harder for New Zealanders to access firearms.

In April, less than a month after the shootings, parliament voted by 119 to 1 to change the gun laws.

Military-style semi-automatic weapons were banned, as were parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.

In June, a buy-back scheme began, where the government would compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons.

Prime Minister Arden told reporters on Friday that, under the scheme, 60,907 prohibited firearms have been removed from circulation.

But one gun owners' group said many more prohibited guns are still in circulation.

"['Aakriti Thapar', 'Bbc News']",Ratan Tata: An unlikely friendship between a magnate and a millennial,"Image copyright Shantanu Naidu Image caption Mr Naidu and Mr Tata often watch movies together

It is not everyday that an octogenarian goes viral on Instagram. It's even more unusual if that octogenarian is a billionaire businessman with a carefully cultivated reputation as a reclusive tycoon.

But perhaps the most unusual bit of this particular story is the friendship which led to Ratan Tata's emergence as India's newest social media star.

Indeed, without the help of Shantanu Naidu, the 27-year-old who introduced him to the social media platform and taught him about hashtags and trends, the world would not have discovered their latest ""man crush"".

Mr Naidu hopes that the mix of old family pictures, snapshots of dogs and photographs of the mogul's younger days - including one from five decades earlier which garnered more than half a million hits - will give people a glimpse of the man behind the tycoon.

The man who led the salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group for 21 years, who he now classes among his closest friends.

These days, the two of them do everything together - from getting haircuts to watching films. Their ""intergenerational friendship"" may be quite unusual, but, Mr Naidu says, it is also pretty special.

""He's been a hard boss, a core mentor as well as an understanding friend,"" he told the BBC.

So how did this doe-eyed, curly-haired millennial become business assistant and best friends to one of India's most internationally-recognised business leaders?

Image copyright Shantanu Naidu Image caption Mr Naidu's non-profit provides stray dogs with glow-in-the-dark collars

Mr Naidu is, in fact, a fifth generation Tata employee. However, although his family has a strong connection to the Tata brand, he never thought he would end up working so closely with the man responsible for so much of it.

It was a mutual love of dogs which brought the two together while the younger man was working for one of Mr Tata's companies in the city of Pune, west India.

At the time, Mr Naidu was also running a social initiative called Motopaws, which makes glow-in-the-dark collars for stray dogs. His work was highlighted in the company newsletter, prompting Mr Tata to write him a letter inviting him to Mumbai.

""Shantanu and I first met because of our common concern and affection for stray dogs,"" Mr Tata explained in an email to the BBC. ""He has led a team of young college students to 'adopt' these dogs and give them affection, food, find homes for them and give them a sense of belonging.""

The meeting would prove to be the first of many.

""While Motopaws was scaling up, we became closer. Work emails slowly turned into asking questions about one another,"" Mr Naidu said.

But soon after their friendship took off, Mr Naidu had to leave India for university in the US.

""I was really sad because it felt like I had just discovered a friend in Mr Tata,"" he said.

But the connection between the two strengthened. Mr Naidu ended up at Mr Tata's alma mater, Cornell University, and soon started work on the businessman's dream project, building a veterinary hospital in Mumbai. The construction for this hospital is set to begin later this year.

Mr Tata even attended his graduation.

""I had mentioned it to him in passing and he said yes,"" Mr Naidu recalls. ""Cut to the actual day and there he was!""

Image copyright Shantanu Naidu Image caption Mr Naidu graduated from Mr Tata's alma mater, Cornell University

On his return to India, Mr Naidu took up a job as as Mr Tata's business assistant.

""Everything for me changed in a single minute. I had never imagined my life would pan out this way,"" he said.

Mr Tata told the BBC: ""I enjoy seeing Shantanu's freshness and concern. We never see enough of this in the 'dog eat dog' world we live in.'""

So, what does a typical day look like as business assistant to Mr Tata?

""At meetings, I take copious notes and keep records for future discussions. As Mr Tata walks in, I'm there to brief him on the happenings of the day. He gives me his plan and we start attacking it one by one. He's a very focused worker - non-stop, no breaks,"" Mr Naidu explained.

The Tata Group patriarch is known to have invested in more than 73 Indian start-ups, including ride-hailing service, Ola. Mr Tata now uses the Instagram profile Mr Naidu helped set up to connect with the youth and has also shared ""a recipe"" for successful start-up pitches.

The 82-year-old has also used it to share the aforementioned picture of him in his 20s - using the popular hashtag Throwback Thursday - to set the internet alight.

But it isn't just business. The two remain fast friends.

He added that they both like action comedy films such as The Other Guys and The Lone Ranger. A series about experiences in the Israel Defence Force called Fauda is Mr Tata's favourite Netflix binge, Mr Naidu said.

Last year during a radio interview with the BBC, I met Mr Tata and Mr Naidu.

It was easy to sense a warm bond between the two - there seemed to be a great degree of camaraderie and mutual respect. Mr Tata spoke about his retirement plans and love for dogs.

Nowadays, Mr Naidu continues to also work on the project that brought Mr Tata and him together in the first place.

Motopaws has expanded over the years and it now operating in four countries. But it isn't just the non-profit that's evolving.

""If something were to bother me or make me happy, he would be the first person I would call. The foundation is there, but it's like a constantly blossoming tree. Mr Tata has always been there for me and I try to do the same for him,"" Mr Naidu said with a smile.

"['Swaminathan', 'Natarajan', 'Khadeeja Arif', 'Bbc World Service']",Saviour of the dead: Burying the bodies India forgets,"Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mohammad Shareef began burying bodies after his son's death

Mohammad Shareef never got to bury his son. Instead, he has spent the last 27 years burying the unclaimed sons and daughters of thousands of other families.

It took a month for police to tell Mr Shareef that his son had died, and even then, they couldn't tell him where, or how.

All Mr Shareef knows is that his son, Mohammad Rais, was one of almost 2,000 people killed in the Hindu-Muslim riots which engulfed India following the destruction of a mosque on a disputed religious site in 1992.

Mr Shareef doesn't even know where the 25-year-old was buried.

""Police told me his body had decomposed,"" Mr Shareef recalled, almost three decades on. ""We didn't see his body. We only got his clothes.""

But a few months later, he would witness something which would change his life forever.

""One day I saw police officers throwing a body into a river. I was horrified,"" Mr Shareef says.

Along with the horror, came a realisation.

""I think my son's body might have been thrown into a river, just like other such dead bodies. That day I said to myself, from today I am the guardian of abandoned dead bodies and I will give them a proper funeral.""

Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mr Shareef says his wife Bibi never recovered from the death of their son

Unclaimed bodies pile up in India for a host of reasons: they could be people who lost their lives in road and rail accidents, or people who died far from home - pilgrims, migrants, old people abandoned by their children.

Some impoverished patients die in hospital with no-one to take care of the funeral.

But what to do with the bodies? Back in 1992, many districts in India didn't have a mortuary facility. It was fairly common practice to dispose of unclaimed bodies quickly.

Burial was the preferred method, but in some places in north India they dumped unclaimed human remains into rivers to save money, time and effort.

More stories from India

Mr Shareef's family have long suspected that Rais' body ended up in the Gomti river. It flows past Sultanpur, the city where the young man had been working as a chemist in December 1992 - the month when Hindu fundamentalists tore down the 16th Century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, Mr Shareef's home, 65km (40 miles) away.

Rais went missing amid the bloodshed which followed.

""After my son disappeared I searched for him everywhere for a month, like a mad man,"" his father says. ""I didn't find him anywhere. I even went to Sultanpur to look for him.""

Then came the news they had been dreading: their beloved son was dead. Mr Sharif and his wife Bibi were traumatised. His wife still struggles with periods of depression to this day.

The pain is aggravated by the fact they were not able to give their son a proper burial. It is a pain no one else should go through, Mr Shareef says.

""I decided that in my district, I wouldn't let any unidentified body be thrown away into a river,"" he says.

Image copyright Mohd Shabir Image caption Shareef says he takes care of the unknown dead persons as he would a family member

In India's caste-bound Hindu society, those who were at the bottom were historically forced to do the job of burial and cremations - and then treated as ""untouchables"" as a result.

But Mr Shareef - a bicycle mechanic by trade - was not to be deterred. He told the police about his desire to take up a task shunned by everyone else.

""When I got the first call, my heart was pounding. After the post-mortem, the police asked me to take away the body. I clearly remember that person's neck was slashed.""

Soon, his workload started to increase. He even bought a four-wheeled cart to transport the dead.

Predictably his family members, friends and neighbours were taken aback. Even as a Muslim, Mr Sharif began to experience the same social exclusion as his Hindu colleagues.

""No-one in my family was happy at that time. They said, 'you have gone mad'.

""Some people were afraid of me. They thought they would get infected with germs if they made physical contact with me.""

Yet Mr Shareef was resolute in his conviction. He had skipped family weddings, festivals and even prayers for the sake of unknown people. It gave him peace and solace: performing last rights is a moment to remember his son.

""It helped me to deal with the pain of my son's death. I think about him all the time. I miss him.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In the Hindu caste system, those who are relegated to the bottom of the pyramid are forced to assist with cremations and burials

It is not an easy job. Police often struggle to identify the body, which means they may have been dead for some time. Often it is not the bodies, Mr Shareef says, but the smell which is most off-putting.

""Whenever I see a badly mutilated or decomposed body it is difficult to sleep. I have nightmares and resort to sleeping tablets,"" he explains.

""Sometimes police officials come with me to the cemetery but even they stand far away.""

All the same, he always takes the time to ensure the person is given the proper treatment, usually bathing the body.

If he realises the dead person is Muslim, he wraps the body in a sheet of cloth and recites the final prayers. If the body belongs to a Hindu, he takes it to be cremated.

No-one know exactly how many bodies Mr Shareef has buried. The head of Ayodhya district administration, Anuj Kumar Jha, told the BBC that they don't have full records of the bodies handed over to Mr Shareef.

""Our rough estimate is we would have given about 2,500 bodies to him,"" he said. Mr Shareef's family say he has given last rites to more than 5,500 people.

Yet for years, he toiled without any financial support. To this day, he works in his bicycle shop, earning the equivalent of about $3 a day.

Image copyright Shabir Image caption Mr Shareef continues to run his roadside cycle repair shop to provide for himself and his wife

But things are changing. He has been recognised for his dedication. The government has given him one of India's highest civilian awards, while local shop owners now also help cover his expenses. At the age of 80, he is now able to have two paid assistants who are sharing his burden.

""Both Hindus and Muslims help me. People give me food and warm blankets. Recently I had to have an eye operation - a stranger called me and gave me 20,000 rupees [$290].""

But retirement is not something he is willing to consider. Neither his two surviving sons nor grandchildren want to follow in his footsteps, and he is acutely aware of what will happen if he stops doing this work.

""If I am not there, police will throw the bodies into rivers as they did before.""

For a man who some call the ""saviour of the dead"" that would be unbearable.

""I will continue doing this till my last breath,"" he says.

"['Jonathan Head', 'South East Asia Correspondent']",Coronavirus: Tourism in Thailand hit by Covid-19,"Image copyright Jonathan Head Image caption Tourists have deserted Thailand over coronavirus fears

Over the past 25 years, Thailand has experienced a spectacular economic crash (1997), a tsunami (2004), coups (2006, 2014), the occupation of its main international airport by protesters (2008) and serious political violence (2010).

Yet the statistics speak for themselves. In 1960 around 80,000 foreign tourists came here.

Last year it reached 39 million, earning more than $60bn (£46bn) for Thailand, and indirectly contributing around one fifth of the country's national income.

The country's tourism sector was considered so robust that the country got the nickname ""Teflon Thailand"". Yet of those 39 million tourists last year, more than 10 million were Chinese.

Image copyright Jonathan Head Image caption The streets of old Phuket Town are now as deserted as the empty beaches

So when the Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan on 23 January, and stopped all overseas tours, the impact was felt immediately in Thailand. Shopping malls and temples in Bangkok were suddenly much quieter and less crowded.

As more flights from China were cancelled, the airports emptied. You could whisk yourself through passport control in no time.

For small-scale entrepreneurs, the collapse of Chinese tourism has been disastrous.

Many of them, such as flower sellers, traditional dancers, and the drivers of the famous ""red cars"" minibuses in Chiang Mai, are reporting their income dropping by half over the past month. The informal association representing tour guides in Thailand thinks 25,000 people are now out of work.

Image caption Nattakit Lorwitworrawat's business is now struggling due to a lack of customers

One of the first successes of Thailand's 60-year-long tourist boom was the island of Phuket, nicknamed the ""Pearl of the Andaman"" for its soft white-sand beaches and sparkling warm seas.

The first foreign visitors in the 1980s and 1990s were mainly European and Australian, but the number of Chinese visitors last year shot up to about two million out of the 15 million foreigners.

The mangrove-lined inlets on the east side of the island, a contrast to the beaches facing the west, are where the boats leave from to take tourists out to the islands offshore. Like many of Phuket's residents, Nattakit Lorwitworrawat moved here from his home town elsewhere in Thailand to start a business.

His company now owns 30 speed boats, each able to carry 30 people. He has had to take 20 out of the water, and the remaining 10 are not getting much use. The inlet, normally constantly noisy from the sound of outboard motors, is now silent apart from the birds and the lapping water.

""At the peak two years ago we carried 1,000 clients a day. Today if we get 200 clients, that is considered very good - we would be very happy with that,"" says Nattakit.

He has bank loans to service on many of his boats. If the crisis goes on beyond the end of this year, he says he will have to downsize the company and start laying off his staff.

For those lower down the food chain it is even tougher.

Somkiat Prasarn has a mortgage on his little house, and loans on the van and car he bought to take Chinese tourists out on day trips around the island. He is supporting four children and an elderly mother.

His monthly payments on the loans, he said, are around $1,500 a month. Could he hold out for six months, I asked him? ""I cannot, sir,"" he says. Right now he is getting no custom at all apart from the occasional airport pickup.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Those tourists who are still are arriving in Thailand are being tested at the airports

""The government needs to help us and soon,"" says Sarayuth Mallam, vice-president of the Phuket Tourism Association. ""We don't ask for much. But if they want us not to lay off staff, they have to help us by cutting or delaying tax payments, social security payments, and giving soft loans to businesses here.""

Sarayuth also believes the powerful Tourism Authority of Thailand needs to start promoting Phuket aggressively in other markets outside China, like Russia, India and Australia. If they can control the virus in three months, he says, we can survive and come back.

But nobody knows how long this crisis will last, nor how serious it will become. For the moment there are still plenty of Europeans, Australians and Russians on the famous beaches, but for how long?

The authorities here have managed to control and monitor infections well considering how vulnerable it was from the number of Chinese people visiting before the restrictions on travel were implemented.

Yet the country has already been placed on some government lists of places to avoid because of coronavirus risk.

And people are booking holidays for later in the year, including the traditional high seasons of July-August and December-New Year in Thailand.

Families with children from Europe or Australia are likely to think twice before travelling so far. And Thailand is now imposing its own restrictions, requiring 14-day quarantine for visitors from some countries, a list that may well expand.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Streets and shopping centres in Bangkok are much quieter than usual

Who will risk booking a holiday in the sun if they end up spending it confined to their hotel room or a hospital?

With more flights being cancelled every week, the numbers of non-Chinese tourists are bound to fall steeply this year, however quickly the virus is brought under control.

The blow to this essential leg of Thailand's economy has come at a terrible time for the government. Already the other two main legs of the economy - manufacturing exports and agricultural commodities - are wobbling as higher wages and an overvalued local currency have been driving investors to cheaper neighbouring countries like Vietnam.

Growth in what was once one of South East Asia's ""tiger economies"" has been anaemic for several years, and may stall completely this year. The government, an unwieldy coalition controversially built around the same military leaders who led the last coup, is proving clumsy and unpopular.

It is an almost perfect storm, one that Thailand's present leaders look ill-equipped to weather.

,Bristol sisters aim to raise awareness of 'honour hate',"Image caption Amaleelah wants to raise awareness of ""slut shaming"" in different communities

Two sisters who had experienced ""honour hate"" in their community are to work to raise awareness of it in schools.

Amaleehah and Nadia Aslam-Forrester, from Bristol, were targeted by members of the Asian community for posting photos of themselves in skirts online.

The sisters, who have a Pakistani mother and English father, said they were ""slut-shamed"" for not upholding cultural norms of women's behaviour.

They are now working with a charity to educate young people about the issue.

So-called honour crimes are acts that have been committed to protect or defend the supposed honour or reputation of a family and extended community.

Amaleehah Aslam-Forrester, 22, said the pair had always been creative and would use Instagram to express their love of art, modelling and clothes.

However, they faced a backlash online for the photographs because of what they said were ""deeply ingrained cultural pressures"".

Image copyright Amaleehah Image caption Amaleelah said the ""hate messages"" they received were ""awful""

Their social media presence also alarmed their mother.

Worried about their safety, she put the sisters in touch with Integrate, a youth-led charity in Bristol which has campaigned for gender and racial equality and been supported by Sport Relief.

They attended a series of workshops with other young women about issues including female genital mutilation, sexism and honour-based violence and eventually made a film about the issue.

Amaleehah said: ""In our community, honour lies within the body of a woman.

""There's always pressure on her to uphold men's honour in her behaviour and also in the way she dresses.

'Hate messages'

""We had one case where someone told us to drink bleach [on social media].

""We got a lot of hate messages. Some people were anonymous, making fake accounts. It was awful.

""And that was all because we were being judged, there was stereotyping involved.""

She said ""slut-shaming"" in general was about women's honour and there is no culture in society that does not experience some form of this.

""Integrate gave us a voice in a community that didn't really understand us.""

"['Laura Bicker', 'Bbc News']","Coronavirus in South Korea: How 'trace, test and treat' may be saving lives","Image copyright AFP Image caption Daegu city has been worst affected by the coronavirus in South Korea

In a car park behind a hospital in Seoul, 45-year-old Rachel Kim rolls down her car window and sticks out her tongue. She travelled to Daegu last week, the area with the highest number of coronavirus cases in South Korea.

Now she's developed a bad cough and a fever. Fearing the worst, she decided to get a Covid-19 test at one of the dozens of drive-through centres. Two people dressed head-to-toe in white protective clothing, clear goggles and surgical face masks are ready for her.

A long swab stick is rummaged around the back of her mouth and throat and then placed carefully into a long test tube.

Then comes the tough bit. The swab goes right up her nose. She screws up her eyes in discomfort, but the whole thing is over in minutes. She rolls up her car window and off she drives. She will get a call if the result is positive, or a text if it's negative.

Negative pressure room

Nearly 20,000 people are being tested every day for coronavirus in South Korea, more people per capita than anywhere else in the world.

Rachel's sample is quickly shipped off to a nearby laboratory where staff are working 24 hours a day to process the results.

Image caption This drive-through test centre in Seoul is one of dozens across the country

In the battle to contain the contagion, these labs have become the front line. South Korea has created a network of 96 public and private laboratories to test for coronavirus.

Health officials believe this approach may be saving lives. The fatality rate for coronavirus in South Korea is 0.7%. Globally the World Health Organization has reported 3.4% - but scientists estimate that the death rate is lower because not all cases are reported.

I turned up at Green Cross laboratories just outside Seoul as a new batch of samples arrived to be tested. Dr Oh Yejin gave us a tour until she stopped at a door and made it clear we were not allowed through.

Ask me

""The tests are carried out in this negative pressure room,"" she told me. ""It prevents any droplets from the samples escaping.""

Inside, two doctors in bright yellow protective clothing are moving around the sealed room. They lift up a number of test tubes and get to work.

Beside us dozens of machines are whirring away and processing results. These are PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests - in very basic terms it is searching for the presence of Covid-19 in the sample.

The whole process from test tube to test result is about five to six hours.

Lessons from Mers

Professor Gye Cheol Kwon, the chairman of the Laboratory Medicine Foundation, calls this the Korean ""bali bali"" gene. Bali means quick in Korean. He says this because the South Koreans managed to design and create a test, set up a network of labs across the country and get it all to work in 17 days.

But this has come from bitter experience.

""We learned the risk of new infection and its ramifications from the experience of the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (Mers) back in 2015,"" he told me. Thirty-six people died in South Korea during the Mers outbreak.

It forced the country to reassess its approach to infectious diseases. South Korea's Centres for Disease Control even set up a special department to prepare for the worst. In this case, that preparation appears to have paid off.

""I think that early patient detection with accurate tests followed by isolation can lower the mortality rate and prevent the virus from spreading,"" said Prof Kwon. ""To learn from the past and prepare systems in advance… that might be the true power to overcome this new kind of disaster.""

It had been quite quiet for the team at Green Cross until early February when a patient - now known in South Korea as ""patient 31"" - with no known history of travel and no contact with previous cases tested positive for the virus.

She belonged to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect with over 200,000 members. It led to a race to find the source of the outbreak and trace everyone affected. South Korea's labs were put to the test. Fatigue among staff has been an issue. Now they work shifts and Dr Oh tells me, delightedly, that she is finally able to get some sleep.

Role model

There is no shortage of testing kits in South Korea. Four companies have been given approval to make them. It means the country has the capacity to test 140,000 samples a week.

Prof Kwon believes the accuracy of South Korea's Covid-19 test is around 98%. The ability to test so many people has made the country a role model as others look to battle their own coronavirus outbreaks.

But there have been missteps too.

At least two patients died waiting for a hospital bed in Daegu, the worst affected city. The initial reaction was to quarantine everyone infected with the virus in a hospital bed, but now the doctors have learned to treat those with mild symptoms in residential centres and leave the clinical beds for those needing critical care.

""We can't quarantine and treat all patients. Those who have mild symptoms should stay home and get treated,"" Dr Kim Yeon-Jae, an infectious disease specialist from the Korea National Medical Centre told me.

""We should change our end goal strategy to lower death rates. So other countries like Italy, that see huge numbers in patients, should also change their strategies as well.""

Wherever the virus hits in large numbers - makeshift test centres follow.

This week in Seoul, there was a mass infection at a call centre. Medics set up outside and quickly took swabs from hundreds of staff in the building.

Vaccine hope

The blood of recovered patients is also being monitored and analysed. Scientists have developed a ""unique"" protein that can detect antibodies - the hope is that it will help create a vaccine in the future.

One of the former patients undergoing weekly blood tests is Mr Lee. (He did not wish to give his first name). He was working in Wuhan, China in December when the virus struck the city. He was flown home by the South Korean government and tested positive for Covid-19 while in quarantine near Seoul.

Image caption Mr Lee was working in Wuhan and tested positive - but had only a mild case of the virus

His mum was upset.

""People around me were very worried,"" he said. ""I heard my mum cried every night.""

But she did not need to worry. The 28-year-old only had a mild case of the virus.

""I felt fine and almost had no symptoms. Just a little cough. Speaking from my own experience, it's really important to still be cautious and safe, but I wish people would have less fear of the virus itself.

""For me at least, the virus felt weaker than a regular cold. I know those who are older need to be careful. But for young people like me who are healthy, they shouldn't be too worried. Of course, it is important to take preventive measures though.""

'Better to know'

The preventative measures being taken in South Korea have so far involved no lockdowns, no roadblocks and no restriction on movement.

Trace, test and treat is the mantra. So far this country of over 50 million people have been doing their bit to help. Schools remain closed, offices are encouraging people to work from home, large gatherings have stopped.

However, slowly, day by day, more people are creeping back onto the streets of the capital city, Seoul. Restaurants, buses and subways are beginning to get busy again.

Dealing with the threat of coronavirus is the new normal. Most people wear masks (if they can get hold of one). There are thermal imaging cameras in the entrances to major buildings.

Bottles of hand sanitisers have been placed in lifts. There are even people dressed in costumes at subway entrances reminding you to wash your hands.

This may be the new normal for South Korea and elsewhere. But health officials are still on edge and warning there is no room for complacency. One large outbreak at a church, office, exercise class or apartment block can change everything.

And as for Rachel Kim, she got a text the day after her test. She doesn't have coronavirus. But she's glad she got tested.

""Better to know"", she said, ""and that way I am not a danger to others.""

,How Kashmir's artists are portraying life under lockdown,"Image caption This piece by Syed Mujtaba Rizvi shows how Kashmiris are being robbed of the ability to speak

A long shutdown in Indian-administered Kashmir has disrupted millions of people's lives. The BBC's Chinki Sinha speaks to artists about how their work has been affected.

""I will send you a photo of the key hanger I made when I go back,"" he said.

Malik Sajad, 33, a graphic novelist, was in the capital Delhi to use the internet in November, like many others from his home of Indian-administered Kashmir. But he never did send me the picture.

The region was under a partial internet ban for months, after having been subjected to the longest shutdown of any democracy.

Authorities had imposed a clampdown on Kashmir on 5 August 2019, after they revoked the Muslim-majority region's semi-autonomous status and split it into two federally-administered territories.

Landlines and mobile phone networks were also severely restricted for months before being gradually allowed to come back online.

The government said the measures - decried by many as draconian and excessive were necessary to prevent violent protests and maintain law and order.

But for many, they have brought about hopelessness and despair.

Among those affected are a cohort of Kashmiri artists, who say they have long used their art as a medium of expression, resistance and resilience.

Mr Sajad, who has worked as a cartoonist for the Greater Kashmir newspaper since he was 15 and published a graphic novel about life in the region, says he began making a little cardboard helicopter for his three-and-half-year old nephew after the little boy was fascinated by drones flying in the sky above their home.

""That's art, too,"" he said.

He added that many artists were trying to record the difficulty of their everyday lives, as a response to the situation there.

Life in the region is not easy. One of the most militarised zones in the world, Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, which only control parts of it.

The two nuclear-armed rivals have already fought two wars and a limited conflict over it. A militant uprising in the nineties against Indian rule saw a revival after Indian forces shot dead a popular militant in 2016. Thousands of civilians participated in rallies against the government, which were violently dispersed by security forces.

Delhi-based Kashmiri origin performance artist Inder Salim is one of them. He says he has created jewellery out of the pellets that he says have caused such chaos among ordinary people in the region.

Indian forces have been criticised for their use of pump action shot guns that spray pellets to quell civilian protests. Although non-lethal, the weapons have caused hundreds of cases of full and partial blindness, including among children and babies.

Image caption Pellets are thought to have blinded hundreds in Kashmir

But Mr Salim, who is known for his provocative performance art, says his ""main work"" at the moment is a petition he has filed in the Supreme Court challenging the government move on Kashmir.

Other artists are responding in different ways.

Artist Masood Hussain (64), who has lived in the city of Srinagar for most of his life, says he has spent a lot of his time ""chronicling"" life in Kashmir, but that this time, things feel different.

""All my paintings before concluded with hope. This is the first time I have not concluded with hope but doom,"" he told the BBC over the phone from Srinagar.

His latest work, on canvas, is what he calls a ""response"" to this ""final betrayal"". It is a rendition of a black and white photo of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in conversation with Sheikh Abdullah, who held the title of Kashmir's prime minister, discussing Article 370 - the constitutional provision that guaranteed Kashmir its special status.

Many have called the revocation of this provision a ""betrayal"" of the basis on which the princely state of Kashmir became a part of India.

Image copyright Abid Bhat Image caption Artist Masood Hussain says this piece is his ""most despondent work"" to date

Artist Syed Mujtaba Rizvi says the lockdown adversely affected his work, he has spent long hours in his studio at home in Srinagar since the lockdown happened.

""I made absolutely nothing for at least the first 30 days. After that, I had to force myself into doing something, for the sake of my own sanity,"" he said.

His work ""Normalcy in the Shrine"" is a reference to the fact that many media outlets have been reporting that life is ""back to normal"" there.

It is a painting of one of the minarets of the historic Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, where people have been barred from praying - not just during the last three months of the lockdown, but quite often in the past decade.

His other painting- of a woman holding a dead child - is a continuation of a series that Rizvi started last year. It is called Redundant Conversations.

According to him, the creative process of art thrives in a conflict zone. However, he says it dies because there is no-one to see the work.

""No-one wants to show works by Kashmiri artists at the moment. Even the Srinagar Biennale is on hold for now,"" he said.

These works will languish as they have always. But they are an antidote to the news that portrays Kashmir as ""normal"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51486341,BBC,Asia,True
"['Paul Rincon', 'Science Editor', 'Bbc News Website']",Smallest dinosaur found 'trapped in amber',"Image copyright Lida XING

Scientists have discovered what they say is the smallest known dinosaur.

The new species has been described by one team member as the ""weirdest fossil"" she has ever worked on.

The specimen, from northern Myanmar, consists of a bird-like skull trapped in 99-million-year-old amber.

Writing in the prestigious journal Nature, researchers report that the dinosaur would have been similar in size to the bee hummingbird - the tiniest living bird.

The stunning find may shed light on how small birds evolved from dinosaurs - which were often bigger.

While the smallest dinosaurs, such as the bird-like Microraptor, weighed hundreds of grams, the bee hummingbird weighs just 2g.

""Animals that become very small have to deal with specific problems, like how to fit all sensory organs into a very small head, or how to maintain body heat,"" said Prof Jingmai O'Connor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.

Image copyright HAN Zhixin Image caption Artwork: Despite its tiny size, Oculudentavis appears to have been a predator

The new species, dubbed Oculudentavis khaungraae, appears to have dealt with these challenges in unusual ways.

For example, the animal's eye structure surprised the scientists.

Birds have a ring of bones, the scleral ring, that helps to support the eye. In most birds, the individual bones, called scleral ossicles, are simple and fairly square.

But in Oculudentavis, they are spoon-shaped, a characteristic previously only found in some living lizards.

The bones of the eye would have formed a cone, like the eye bones in owls. This indicates that the dinosaur had exceptional vision.

Unlike owls, the eyes faced sideways and the opening at the centre of the ossicles was narrow, which would have restricted the amount of light coming into the eye. This provides strong evidence that Oculudentavis was active in the daytime.

Image copyright LI Gang Image caption A CT scan of the skull of Oculudentavis

In addition, the creature's eyes would have bulged out of its head in a manner not seen in any other living animal, making it hard to understand exactly how the eyes functioned.

""It's the weirdest fossil I've ever been lucky enough to study,"" Prof O'Connor explained. ""I just love how natural selection ends up producing such bizarre forms. We are also super lucky this fossil survived to be discovered 99 million years later.""

Because the new specimen consists of only a skull, understanding how it is related to birds is unclear. Some features of the skull are like those of dinosaurs, while others are like those of very advanced birds.

The researchers say that the new specimen's remarkable suite of traits could have evolved either through the constraints of miniaturisation, or through becoming specialised to a particular lifestyle.

The dinosaur's jaw had a surprisingly large number of teeth. This would appear to suggest that, despite its tiny size, Oculudentavis was a predator that ate insects.

Image copyright HAN Zhixin Image caption Artwork: Oculudentavis had a surprisingly large number of teeth

Some soft tissue has also been preserved with the skull, notably the remains of the animal's tongue, which could yield further insights into its biology.

The find highlights the incredible potential of amber to preserve fossil specimens that might not otherwise have survived.

Co-author Dr Luis Chiappe, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, said: ""It's lucky this tiny creature was preserved in amber, as such small, fragile animals aren't common in the fossil record.

""This finding is exciting because it gives us a picture of the small animals that lived in a tropical forest during the age of dinosaurs.""

The geographical location of the find might have something to do with the process of miniaturisation, say the scientists.

Isolation is often involved in animals evolving smaller body size, with some notable examples occurring on islands.

Interestingly, the amber from Myanmar is thought to have formed on an ancient island arc.

,Letter from Africa: The spread of coronavirus prejudice in Kenya,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Passengers arriving in Kenya on flights from China were being screened at the end of January

In our series of letters from African writers, Kenyan journalist Waihiga Mwaura reflects on how the coronavirus has fuelled anti-Chinese prejudice in his country.

Despite the concerns around the spread of the coronavirus, the greatest enemy is not the virus itself, but ""fears, rumours and stigma"".

Not my words, but those of the Ethiopian who is leading the global effort to lessen the impact of Covid-19.

The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was responding at the end of last month to cases of anti-Chinese prejudice. He repeated the message on Twitter earlier this week while sharing a story about a Singaporean man who was beaten up in the UK capital, London, over the coronavirus.

The virus of prejudice is spreading. Kenya is no exception.

'You are coronavirus'

A shakily filmed video has been circulating on social media here showing an Asian man and woman being bullied by a large crowd in a low-income area of the capital, Nairobi.

The video begins with unidentified individuals in the crowd shouting: ""You are coronavirus, you are coronavirus.""

The man responds by trying to film the crowd but quickly realises that his female companion could be attacked so rushes to her aid.

He stands up to the most aggressive member of the crowd and starts shouting back: ""We don't have corona, we don't have corona.""

The video stops before we see how the incident ended but it was a true depiction of the side-effects of the coronavirus.

Citizen TV Before Kenya has even recorded a case, the fear, mixed with stigma, is palpable""

On 27 February, a message went viral on Facebook, allegedly posted by a Kenyan member of parliament, calling for his constituency residents to avoid interaction with Chinese nationals who had just returned from China after celebrating their new year.

The post warned that if the government did not do enough to protect its citizens, and forcefully quarantine any of these Chinese nationals, then the residents had his permission to chase away and stone any Chinese people within their vicinity.

China's embassy responded quickly with a Twitter post calling for a ""rational and scientific approach towards Chinese communities"" and described the remarks that had been made as racist.

Kenya is not alone in this prejudice, but what is interesting is that all the initial cases of the virus in sub-Saharan Africa have been linked to European travel rather than China. Yet there is no equivalent anti-European feeling.

Before Kenya has even recorded a case, the fear, mixed with stigma, is palpable.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some Kenyans have campaigned to stop flights coming in from China

The prejudice has been fuelled by China and Kenya's entwined economic relationship.

Kenya has borrowed a large amount of money from China for big infrastructure projects. While the ordinary Kenyan is not feeling the benefit, they are looking for someone to blame for their economic woes.

Tired of pointing the finger at the government, some here have re-directed their frustrations towards the growing number of Chinese nationals who have come to seek economic opportunities.

Coronavirus fears, therefore, have found fertile ground and led to some extraordinary behaviour.

Adrian Blomfield, a veteran freelance journalist here, said that all the drivers at his local taxi rank had agreed not to carry Chinese people as passengers.

One taxi driver told me that Chinese nationals were changing their user names on the taxi hailing apps to avoid their passenger request being declined.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kenya has now set up its first patient isolation centre

He also informed me that when they are ferrying passengers from the airport, they roll the windows down and even wear facemasks, especially if the passengers had just landed from China.

He wound up his narrative by demanding that the government provide free face masks to all taxi drivers who ply the airport route and to provide more information to the public.

There has been some criticism here that the authorities have been slow in educating the public about the virus and warning them against prejudice.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

The vacuum has been filled by rumours and misinformation. A sensitisation campaign has now been promised, but it may come too late.

Nevertheless, for Chinese nationals living in Kenya, like Lin Yimenghan, who runs a charity, life goes on.

He has witnessed only one worrying incident when someone called him ""coronavirus"" at a bus stop in Nairobi.

'Love and understanding'

But his analysis of the situation is remarkable.

""It is normal for people to fear something they are not aware of,"" he told me calmly.

The spread of the stigma is faster than the spread of the virus, he added, and ended with some advice: ""People should have more understanding and love for each other.""

If only everyone had such an attitude, then this world would be a more peaceful place.

,Troy Collings: North Korea's 'first budget travel agent' dies aged 33,"Image copyright Young Pioneer Tours Image caption Troy Collings was a pioneer for the North Korea tourism industry

The head of the first budget travel agency to North Korea, Troy Collings, has died of a heart attack at 33.

He was the co-founder and managing director of Young Pioneer Tours - an agency which focused on younger tourists who wanted to travel to the secretive communist country.

Driven by the goal of making visiting North Korea affordable, the company had a big impact on tourism to the North.

Mr Collings, who was from New Zealand, died last week, the company said.

""Troy was instrumental in establishing Young Pioneer Tours as one of the leading travel companies for North Korea,"" the firm said in a statement.

""We here at YPT have lost a visionary and a true pioneer to the travelling industry.

""Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know or to be led on a tour by Troy have lost a dear friend.""

Image copyright Young Pioneer Tours Image caption Mr Collings at the Korean War Museum in Pyongyang

Mr Collings co-founded the company with Gareth Johnson in 2008.

In an interview in 2018, he said his interest in the country was spurred by the 2004 documentary on North Korean gymnastics, A State of Mind.

During a subsequent trip, he realised ""the potential tourism had to help the locals and to influence the country's development"".

""More importantly, I made some real human connections with people I met that had a profound effect on me,"" he said.

""I decided during that trip that this is what I wanted to dedicate my life to.""

Image copyright Young Pioneer Tours Image caption Eager to interact with North Koreans, he sometimes joined a local English class

Together with Mr Johnson - to whom he credited the idea - he began building a travel business to take groups to North Korea, at around half the cost of what other tour organisers were asking.

""The hurdles were less than most people would expect, but that was mostly due to good relations, with good partners we had formed in Pyongyang over our visits,"" he said.

The agency's packages range from visiting the capital, to the Pyongyang Marathon, to tours through the countryside.

""If it were not for the budget pricing model which YPT pioneered then many young people would never have had the chance to visit the DPRK,"" Chad O'Carroll, managing director of North Korea specialist website NK News told the BBC.

""These are tours which in some cases - such as my own - played a major role in catalyzing a long-term interest in focusing on the country.""

All trips to North Korea receive close scrutiny from the North - groups are accompanied by a North Korean guide and it's not possible to choose your own itinerary.

The company was thrust into the spotlight in 2016 after one of its customers, Otto Warmbier, was arrested in Pyongyang for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda sign and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was returned to the US in a coma in June and died a week later.

Today, the company also offers other tours off the beaten track, including Chernobyl in Ukraine or East Timor in Asia.

In 2018, Mr Collings said he'd ""learnt a lot - but the biggest lessons have probably been to examine my own biases and view everything with a critical eye"".

""People talk all the time about North Korean propaganda, but it's naive to think we aren't inundated with our own. Things aren't black and white and agendas are everywhere.

""Don't just form opinions based off the last book or article you read or speaker you saw but reserve judgement until you really have an understanding of a situation.""

While tourism to North Korea remains niche, it has brought a steady flow of revenue to the country.

Numbers are hard to get and not reliable, but it's thought that around 100,000 foreigners visit the country each year.

Nigerian celebrities turned up to a glitzy award ceremony wearing glittery, jewelled face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic.

That is despite medical experts advising that face masks do not provide effective protection.

At least one of the stars said they were using the mask to make a statement rather than to prevent the spread of the virus.

Nigeria has reported just two confirmed cases of coronavirus and no deaths.

The first case of the coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa was an Italian who flew from Milan to Lagos in February.

""Fashion can also be a Protest/Educative not just a Statement...... let's join hands to fight Covid19,"" he said in an Instagram post.

It is not clear whether the comment about joining hands was intended as a joke.

The celebrities were attending the annual AMVCAs for TV and film stars in a luxury hotel in Lagos on Saturday when they wore the masks.

Television presenter and actor Ada Afoluwake Ogunkeye AKA Folu Storms, who wore a jewelled mask on the red carpet, complained that people were getting too close to her.

""No one really paid attention to my social distancing cries so I will be avoiding large crowds for the forseeable future!"" she said in an Instagram post.

""Take care of yourselves people! Wash your hands and avoid touching your face!"" she added.

Meanwhile, another former Big Brother Naija housemate and fashion designer Iheme Faith Uloma AKA Ifu Ennada posted a picture of herself and used the hashtag #CoronaVirusFashion.

,MRKH syndrome: 'The day I discovered I was born without a vagina',"Image copyright Julian Peter

A routine question from her doctor about menstruation set Kenyan Julian Peter, now 29, down a path that led her to discover she was born without a womb, cervix or a vagina. Twelve years on she shared her story with the BBC's Anne Ngugi.

I was born with a condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), where you have no womb or vagina, and you can also find yourself with just one kidney.

A woman who has MRKH can never get periods.

I don't have a uterus, so I've never had periods. This is the normal that I know, I don't feel bad about it.

People have different feelings about who I am.

'They can say whatever they want'

Someone told me that I should go somewhere to be prayed for.

Another person said that because I come from Ukambani [a region that is stereotypically linked to witchcraft] then my grandmother had something to do with this.

They can say whatever they want to but what really matters is how I take it. If I were to listen to them it would start affecting me, and I would start thinking that what they were saying was true.

I discovered I had the syndrome when I was a 17-year-old school student.

I went to hospital as I had problem with my legs, which were swollen. The first thing the doctor asked me was when I last had my period. I had never had one.

Julian Peter I cried on the first day and the second day and the third, but then I moved on... my priority was to get back to school""

They did a scan. The first image indicated that my reproductive tract was closed from the outside.

I went through an operation to open it, which was not successful.

I had another scan that showed I had no uterus or vagina, and that was when I was diagnosed with MRKH.

I cried on the first day and the second day and the third, but then I moved on. I was only 17 and quite small, so my priority was to get back to school.

I was in hospital with my mother, my only parent, and the diagnosis shocked her. I think as a parent there were questions she was bound to ask herself, Essentially she was wondering if she had done something wrong.

'I didn't want the operation'

As I had studied biology, I understood what the doctor was saying that first time.

I told her that I didn't want to go through with an operation at that point as I wanted to go back to school to complete my education.

Ten years later, I went back to hospital and had a successful operation.

The type of MRKH that I had meant that I had no vagina, no womb and I only have one kidney. My vaginal canal was not there and it had to be created.

My life is normal as MRKH does not interfere with how I want to live. But for some it is emotionally disturbing and people might need to go to a psychologist to accept the condition.

When you realise the implications of the condition that you have, you have to forget about giving birth to children.

Getty Images MRKH syndrome Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Characterised by absence of the vagina, cervix and the uterus

Affects one in 5,000 women

Type 1 refers to the absence of reproductive organs

Type 2 refers to the absence of, or abnormality with, a kidney

Usually discoveredduring puberty when menstruation does not start Source: NHS

I have had four scans and no ovaries were found, so even retrieving eggs for IVF cannot be done.

You must accept the way you are. But realising that you are not like other women is difficult, you need someone who you can talk to.

I've met many people here in Kenya with the condition and we share our experiences. I accepted my condition early on and I have accepted myself, so I'm OK.

Explaining to a partner

I have been in relationships. But I don't let things go too far before sitting down with them and letting them know about my condition.

If they want to accept it they will accept it. But you know, human beings are just human beings.

A large percentage of the people I have told have gone away. Others accuse me of lying, they think that I am saying it to chase them away.

Right now I'm not in a relationship, but it's all God's doing.

When it comes to having sex, I had the surgery to reconstruct the vaginal canal in 2018, so it's just over a year after and I am not ready to have sex.

Neither am I ready to get married. If we wanted to have children we could adopt.

It took me at least 10 years to decide to share my story with the public.

There are people who do not understand what MRKH is and I want to raise awareness.

Image copyright Julian Peter Image caption Julian Peter has a support group where people listen and help each other

First of all, I'm advising parents who have babies with such a condition not to accept the operation when your child is young.

Let it happen after they are grown up, when they can understand, because the procedure is complicated and long.

Advice to parents

It's painful and the child may not understand what's happening.

As a parent, also do your research, so that when your daughter gets to know about the condition, you are ready to help to fight the stigma they will face.

I have a support group and I have heard from people with all sorts of challenges.

There are those who are married, and their in-laws are making demands for children. There is one woman who has been told by her in-laws that she is a man.

So we listen and encourage. What is important is to help each other because this journey can be difficult.

"['Anne Soy', 'Senior Africa Correspondent']",Africa v coronavirus: A challenge for the continent,"Image copyright AFP

The coronavirus outbreak is no longer a threat for Africa, it is now a reality as more and more countries on the continent have cases.

East Africa is the last region to confirm infections: Sudan confirmed that a 50-year-old man has died, while Ethiopia says a Japanese man who recently travelled to the country tested positive to Covid-19.

News on Friday that a Kenyan woman, who travelled from the US via London, had the virus sparked panic buying in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.

Pictures and videos shared on social media showed shoppers filling up baskets with hand sanitiser, soap and food.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Liquid soap is selling fast in Nairobi

The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that the window of opportunity to prepare is closing and that critical gaps remain.

""Every country can still change the course of this pandemic by scaling up their emergency preparedness or response,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa.

The inter-governmental organisation says it has now shifted from ""readiness"" to ""response"" mode on the continent.

Experts baffled

Most of the confirmed cases involve people arriving from Europe and North America.

More on Africa and the virus:

The WHO said while local transmission - that is people with no travel history - remains low, containment is the most appropriate strategy.

That means detecting cases quickly, isolating them to minimise transmission, treating them and tracing their contacts.

Yet the relatively low numbers in Africa have baffled experts.

Some suggest the tropical climate is less favourable to the new virus.

John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Prevention and Control, says no data is available to support that theory.

""But we know that Covid-19 is part of the coronavirus family to which the common cold belongs,"" he told the BBC.

These better-known coronaviruses are less prevalent where temperatures are higher.

But Dr Nkengasong hastens to point out that there are significant outbreaks of Covid-19 in countries in the tropics, like Thailand.

If the virus follows the pattern of other viruses, with seasonal peaks in winter, this will be a source of concern for southern Africa, which is heading into its colder months and ""flu season"", Dr Moeti told the BBC.

One thing that put Africa a step ahead of the rest of the world was its early screening at airports and other ports of entry.

This is because infrastructure was already in place and health workers at hand because of the outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which now appears to be coming to an end.

DR Congo's first confirmed case of coronavirus was detected this way.

AFP It's possible that with a predominantly young population, Africa may be spared widespread severe cases""

But most symptoms tend to develop days after arrival, like Nigeria's first patient: the Italian was asymptomatic when he arrived in Lagos. He even travelled to Ogun state before falling ill. His contacts were traced and one of them tested positive for the virus.

The continent has also had time to observe what other countries are doing to combat the new virus and prepare.

During the current pandemic, it been noted that some asymptomatic cases have been infectious.

This is something South Africa's health ministry has taken on board - identifying such cases and advising them to self-quarantine while those with symptoms are treated.

So far, countries with confirmed cases appear to be managing them.

Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia have reported clusters of local transmission.

Widespread person-to-person transmission is what health experts fear most in Africa, as that could quickly overwhelm the health systems.

Across the world, there is a strong correlation between age and severity of the Covid 19 infection.

Older people with pre-existing conditions are more vulnerable.

""It's possible that with a predominantly young population, Africa may be spared widespread severe cases,"" says Dr Nkengasong, as the continent has the world's youngest population.

HIV and Africa's 'big three'

But concerns have been raised about suppressed immunity, particularly among people living with HIV.

HIV eventually wipes out the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to other infections, what is known as acquired human immunodeficiency syndrome (Aids).

More than 32 million people have died from Aids-related illnesses since it was identified in the early 1980s, according to UNAids.

Nearly 38 million are living with the virus, and the vast majority of them are in Africa.

""It's important to underline that there is currently no strong evidence that people living with HIV are at an especially increased risk of contracting Covid-19 or, that if they do contract it, they will experience a worse outcome,"" says head of UNAids Winnie Byanyima.

She notes that there is anxiety among people living with HIV and urges them to take all necessary preventive measures just like the rest of the population.

However she cautions that those with HIV should not be forgotten as countries focus on fighting Covid-19.

A study by UNAids found that when the coronavirus outbreak began in China, people in affected areas living with HIV found it difficult to get hold of their anti-retroviral medicines.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Last year, the WHO reported that 94% of malaria deaths occurred in Africa

She also called for more research into the ""biological and immunological interactions"" between HIV and the new coronavirus.

A Canadian woman and an Italian man kidnapped in Burkina Faso in 2018 are said to be in good health and spirits after arriving in neighbouring Mali.

Édith Blais and Luca Tacchetto, both in their 30s, apparently escaped and were picked up by UN forces before being transferred to Mali's capital, Bamako.

They appeared bemused when officials greeted them with elbows, before the pair were told of new social etiquette measures to help curb coronavirus.

Mali said no ransom had been paid.

None of the many jihadist groups in the region has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.

Plans are now being made to repatriate the couple.

In a statement, Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne said that ""Canada is very relieved"" that the pair ""are now free from captivity"".

He thanked the governments of Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as the UN mission in Mali and other partners for ""their assistance and co-operation over the past year in this matter"".

The pair were wearing clothes of the regional Tuareg people and apparently stopped a passing car and told the driver to take them to the nearest UN post, according to AFP news agency.

However, Ms Blais and Mr Tacchetto have not publicly spoken about how they escaped captivity.

They disappeared on 15 December 2018 in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso.

At the time they were travelling in Western Africa and were making their way to Togo for a humanitarian project.

,South African King Dalindyebo arrested after 'axe rampage',"Image copyright AFP Image caption King Dalindyebo recently spent four years in prison for flogging his subjects and burning their homes in the 1990s

A South African king, a nephew of the late Nelson Mandela, has been arrested after allegedly going on the rampage with an axe in the palace.

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, freed from jail on parole in December, broke into the Thembu royal palace in the early hours.

Witnesses said he was searching for his son, the regent, who was appointed the acting monarch while he was in prison.

The regent escaped through a window, but his wife has been injured and taken to hospital, a royal spokesman said.

King Dalindyebo was sentenced to 12 years in jail for kidnapping, assault and arson, but only served four years after the president granted some prisoners early parole last year.

He was the first monarch to be convicted of a crime in South Africa since white-minority rule ended in 1994.

The 56-year-old comes from the Thembu clan, to which Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, belonged.

South Africa has seven officially recognised monarchs representing different ethnic groups and clans.

'People were running for their lives'

Since King Dalindyebo's release from jail, there have been tensions in the Thembu royal family and he has refused to see his son, acting King Azenathi Zanelizwe Dalindyebo.

Last month, the royal household decided that Azenathi should continue on as regent for at least another year, South Africa's City Press paper reported.

Image copyright AFP Image caption King Dalindyebo, seen here flanked by his chiefs in 2013, has always been a maverick

Royal spokesman Prince Siganyeko Dalindyebo said the king had broken into the palace - Bumbane Great Place, just outside the town of Mthatha in Eastern Cape Province - at around 03:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning.

""He was carrying weapons such as [an] axe, a machete and also a crowbar. He managed to break a window from the sitting room of the main house,"" he told public broadcaster SABC.

""As he was moving up the stairs looking for the acting king, some people managed to distract him and then the acting king managed to jump out of a window, running for safety.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Traditional rulers and chiefs continue to enjoy widespread respect in South Africa

Other people were also running for their lives, the prince said.

""He has wreaked havoc in the palace… he started ransacking the king's room, all confidential documents - he threw them around.""

Video footage shows the troubled monarch later standing outside his palace, calmly smoking a cigarette, and daring the police to arrest him, which they eventually did.

The king was jailed in 2015 after being convicted of assaulting his subjects during a ""reign of terror"" in the 1990s.

He had kidnapped a woman and her six children, set their home on fire and beaten up four youths, one of whom died, because one of their relatives had failed to present himself before the king's traditional court.

Will this spell the end for South African royals?

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is, to put it mildly, a maverick royal.

If his behaviour has often proved extreme, it nonetheless poses some fundamental questions about the role of traditional leaders in modern, post-apartheid South Africa: their entitlements, public funding, the feudal nature of their control and, above all in this case, the extent to which their royal titles grant them impunity.

As well as the formally recognised monarchs, South Africa has thousands of other traditional leaders - headmen and chiefs - who continue to enjoy widespread respect, particularly in rural areas, and who are often called to mediate in civil disputes within their clans.

During the decades of racial apartheid, the white-minority government sought to strengthen the role of royal families, seeking to play them off against the broader and much more threatening liberation movement led by the African National Congress (ANC).

Image copyright AFP Image caption Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is the most influential of South Africa's traditional rulers

But in recent years - and after multiple royal scandals - some South Africans have begun to question the sustainability of the traditional system, not least when it comes to issues like the semi-feudal control that Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini still enjoys over vast areas of land that he rents out to his subjects.

King Zwelithini - whose outspoken views on immigrants and sex education along with his lavish lifestyle have often been criticised - has, like King Dalindyebo, repeatedly challenged the authority of South Africa's democratic government.

The country's royal families face no immediate challenge to their authority, and many South Africans may shrug off King Dalindyebo as an embarrassing outlier.

But after this latest incident, plenty of people will be watching closely to see how fairly, or leniently, he will be treated by prosecutors.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51869417,BBC,Africa,True

Two-time Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya says she is ""supernatural"" as she confidently targets the 200m at Tokyo 2020.

The 29-year-old cannot compete in events between 400m and a mile without taking testosterone-reducing drugs after a World Athletics rule change.

South African Semenya ran 200m in 23.49 seconds - 0.69secs outside the Olympic qualifying time - at an event in Pretoria on Friday.

""I call myself supernatural,"" she said.

The three-time world 800m champion, who spoke of her decision to switch to the 200m in an Instagram post on Friday, must bring her time down to 22.80secs before 29 June to qualify for the South African Olympic team.

""We are chopping the times and I call myself supernatural. I can do anything I want,"" she added.

""I always challenge myself. This was not an easy decision to make.

""I am used to running two laps and then you come and run half a lap. You have to adjust, which is not easy, but anything is possible.""

If Semenya qualifies for the Olympics - which begin on 24 July - she would be set to compete against Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith, who won 200m gold at the 2019 World Championships.

Semenya, who won Olympic gold in the 800m in 2012 and 2016, missed the chance to defend her world 800m title in Doha last year, having failed in her bid to prevent the governing body's rule change.

World Athletics argued female athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) - such as Semenya - have ""a competitive advantage"".

,2021 Africa Cup of Nations: Caf postpones March qualifiers because of coronavirus,"This month's Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers have been indefinitely postponed

The Confederation of African Football (Caf) has postponed this month's 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers because of the coronavirus pandemic.

In a statement on Friday, Caf said the 48 matches scheduled to run between 25-31 March have been postponed until further notice even though only a few cases have been reported on the continent.

""Several players, who are supposed to play the next Afcon qualifiers, come from countries which have been severely affected by the virus (in) Europe and Asia,"" Caf wrote to member associations.

Caf also explained that many African governments have imposed strong travel restrictions, which require 14 days of quarantine, on those arriving from Europe.

At present, at least 18 African nations have reported cases of coronavirus.

Meanwhile, some European clubs - particularly those in Italy, which is in lockdown because of the outbreak - are reluctant to release players because of the virus.

Caf had previously said it would ""maintain its schedule"" until an African country was declared high-risk.

Since that statement on Wednesday, the outbreak has been upgraded to a pandemic while African football's ruling body had also faced pressure from several countries to suspend the qualifiers.

No date has been given for when the matches, to be played in nearly 50 countries across the continent, could be played but Caf said it will ""share a new proposal of a calendar"".

Caf informed its member associations of its decision on Friday

""To prevent one life means more than any matches,"" Zambia coach Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic told BBC Sport Africa.

""Ethically-speaking, no match is more valuable than any life. Football may be 'life' to us but when it comes to preventing certain things, no boundaries are supposed to be crossed in that regard.""

Both the Women's Under-20 World Cup qualifiers scheduled for later this month and April's Women's 2020 Nations Cup qualifiers have also been postponed.

Caf did not postpone next month's African Nations Championship (Chan), which is scheduled to take place in Cameroon between 4-25 April, on account of a forthcoming visit this weekend.

A delegation from Caf's medical committee is set to visit Cameroon - which has reported two cases of coronavirus so far - on Saturday and Sunday, with a view to assessing 'the preventive measures taken by the Local Organising Committee' ahead of the tournament for players based in their own leagues.

,"EU to give migrants in Greece €2,000 to go home","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Migrants live in squalor in Moria camp on Lesbos

The EU says it will pay €2,000 (£1,770; $2,225) each to migrants in overcrowded camps on the Greek islands willing to go back to their home countries.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson announced the scheme in Athens on Thursday. It was agreed with the Greek government.

She said it was temporary - open for one month only - and only for migrants who arrived before 1 January.

She said 5,000 migrants would be eligible for the ""voluntary return"".

This month, hundreds of migrants and refugees have reached Greek islands near Turkey by boat, increasing the pressure on struggling reception centres. The camps on those islands already have nearly 42,000 asylum seekers, though they were designed for about 6,000.

Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which is working on the islands, says more than 14,000 of the migrants are children.

""Men, women and children are living in horrific conditions in these overcrowded centres, in constant fear and with very basic access to services like toilets, showers, electricity,"" Stephan Oberreit, MSF head of mission in Greece, told the BBC.

""Our teams in the clinic opposite Moria camp receive around 70 children per day, including children suffering from chronic illnesses, for which we are not able to provide proper care.""

Ms Johansson said seven EU member states had agreed to take in at least 1,600 unaccompanied children from the camps, seen as especially vulnerable.

Many of the migrants are Syrians fleeing the civil war, but there are also Afghans, Pakistanis and West Africans. It is not clear how many would qualify for refugee status.

Aid agencies consider Syria too dangerous for migrants to be sent back there, but some other countries of origin, such as Pakistan, are considered safe enough.

Greece has temporarily suspended its processing of new asylum applications - a move condemned by aid groups.

Oxfam's spokesman on EU migration, Florian Oel, said ""all EU governments have avoided taking responsibility, not just Greece"" over the migrant crisis.

He said the situation had remained very bad since 2016, when Turkey signed a deal with the EU to halt a much larger flow of migrants into Europe.

The latest surge in numbers at the Greek border came after Turkey announced that it would no longer stop them trying to enter Greece. Turkey, which is hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees already, accuses the EU of not doing enough to help.

""People in need of safety have been turned into political bargaining chips,"" Mr Oel told the BBC.

""The EU partners have to share responsibility for those arriving; it means states should relocate refugees to their own countries and do the asylum procedure there. They must agree on permanent rules.""

However, he welcomed the EU announcement on relocating unaccompanied children as ""a good first step"".

Ms Johansson said repatriation of migrants from the islands would be coordinated with the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the EU border force Frontex.

The situation is also acute on the Greece-Turkey land border, where Greek police have used tear gas and water cannon to keep migrants out.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51859007,BBC,Africa,True
,Odion Ighalo: Manchester United forward scores sparkling goal with virtually nobody there to see it,"Odion Ighalo has scored four goals in three starts for Manchester United

Odion Ighalo's sensational goal for Manchester United in their 5-0 thrashing of LASK in the Europa League was worthy of a packed house at the Linzer Stadion.

Juggling the ball from right foot to left, the 30-year-old Nigeria forward then cannoned a left-footed shot in off the crossbar from 18 yards.

But instead of the roar of a crowd, all that was audible was was a thud of boot to ball and the clang of the crossbar before he was joined by his team-mates.

It was a sparkling effort unfortunately witnessed live by a smattering of people and not the wider audience it deserved due to the coronavirus outbreak restricting the attendance to just 500.

United's substitutes even crowded around a screen in their dugout to watch it again. But then would Ighalo have even attempted it at Old Trafford?

Former United midfielder Paul Ince, suggested otherwise on BT Sport, likening it to the sort of potshot seen at training grounds when the pressure is off.

""Maybe he doesn't do it in front of a full house,"" said Ince. ""It reminds me of one of those that you do at training. Maybe I'm doing a disservice to him.""

However, fellow studio guest Owen Hargreaves, was a touch more complimentary.

""It is like Tony Yeboah, it's a thing of beauty,"" he said, referencing the Ghanaian's famous in-off-the-crossbar volley for Leeds in 1995.

""It is one of the best goals he has ever scored.""

'No-one would have saved that'

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also effusive in his praise of Ighalo, who was a surprise January addition on loan from China's Shanghai Shenhua.

""Odion has done really well when he's come in and he's enjoying himself,"" Solskjaer said.

""He will improve and get better, but he has qualities that we saw in him that we needed and we'll still need those qualities for next season so let's see what we do.

""He is very good back to goal, you can play up to him. Great link player, but maybe the best thing about him is his personality, so he's got the whole lot really.

""He had three touches before his fourth, the finish. All them touches were high quality but he had to make them to create the space for himself.

""But the strike is on the half-volley, great timing. No-one would have saved that one so anyone would be proud of that finish.""

What fans made of it all

Paul Murphy: Remember when we all laughed when United signed Ighalo?

Michal Koziol: Everyone who said Ighalo wasn't the calibre United need should look at that goal over and over again. The first touch, the control, the power, everything perfect. Such a shame the stadium's empty.

Nicholas Mills: Anything about this Ighalo loan spell reminding anyone of Henrik Larsson.

Stuart Mitchell: That goal deserved to be seen by many more people in the ground. Stunning strike and United would do well to sign him up for next season clear he wants to play for the club.

,Guinea-Bissau: Political chaos could boost cocaine trade,"Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption Soldiers have taken over key installations in the capital

For a day recently, the small West African country of Guinea-Bissau had two presidents and two prime ministers, until one of the presidents stepped down citing death threats.

The country has been gripped by political turmoil for so many years that analysts do not agree on exactly how many coups it has had in its 46 years of independence. Some say nine, others count 10. An election held last year was another attempt to carve a new peaceful path but it has sparked yet more chaos, as journalist Ricci Shryock reports.

Amidst the political chaos, daily life appears to be carrying on as normal in the capital, Bissau, but underneath the veneer, residents say they are deeply frustrated with the political chaos and confused about what will happen next and whom to believe.

While the Portuguese word ""saudades"" expresses a longing for the past, the feeling in Bissau is more akin to a longing for a more prosperous future they know is possible, but each time Bissau-Guineans' raise their hopes, they are dashed by political manoeuvring - often backed by guns.

Along the streets, women are selling the country's number-one cash crop - freshly harvested cashews.

But the presence of armed soldiers is a reminder that things are not normal.

The absence of trusted sources of news has provided good fodder for rumours and innuendo, with people constantly trying to parse what is true and what is not.

Contradictory official communiqués and letters from various sides, about who is the rightful president, are being shared on WhatsApp and Facebook in the country of 1.6 million people.

""We don't know what's going on,"" said a hotel manager, Aboubacar, as he scrolled through his Facebook feed. He furrowed his brow and frowned as he tried to decide which local blogs to read.

One restaurant owner, who said the chaos was hurting her business, added: ""For such a tiny country, it's amazing how much fake news we can produce.""

Umaro Cissoko Embaló was announced as the winner of December's election.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Umaro Sissoco Embaló has won two legal challenges and hopes to win a third

The long-time ruling party PAIGC however alleged it was cheated out of victory and insists that Mr Embaló waits for the Supreme Court to rule on its third request to annul the elections. But he refused and has taken the oath of office.

And in the meantime, PAIGC lawmakers, who say that an alliance with smaller parties means they still have a majority in parliament, swore in one of its members as president and insisted their current prime minister stay in office.

However, shortly afterwards PAIGC Cipriano Cassamá stood down, citing fears for his safety.

Fake news fills the vacuum

""The problems in Bissau are structural problems, and the country has never really stabilised politically,"" said Gilles Yabi, founder of West African think-tank, Wathi.

""The country has the history of war, fighting for independence from Portugal, so the presence of the military is directly linked to this history, and the role the military played to get independence.""

Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption An uneasy calm has engulfed the streets of Bissau

He added there were other factors at play in the current crisis.

""The main problem is the political class of the country, and the fact that they have been fighting for power for a long time. The current situation is very polarised. Depending on whom you talk to, they will have quite a different version of things.""

There are two competing versions at the moment: While the PAIGC says the elections was rigged, the opposing side, MADEM-G15, says its candidate Mr Embaló won December's polls and is now rightfully installed at the presidency.

Image copyright Dan Sanha Image caption Cipriano Cassamá was speaker of parliament until he briefly became president

The National Election Commission has repeatedly confirmed that Mr Embaló won the polls with 54% of the vote, and at least one minister in his government has publicly accused their opponents of bribing a Supreme Court judge to rule in PAIGC's favour and stall the confirmation of Mr Embaló's win.

Both sides say they have proof, but in the vacuum of that proof, residents' social media feeds are flooded with false news reports of weapons seizures at a political party's headquarters and politicians hiding out at foreign embassies - events that never happened.

Bissau and the cocaine trade

To add to the confusion, Guinea-Bissau has for many years been used as a staging post in the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America to Europe.

The PAIGC's Aristides Gomes, who still says he is the rightful prime minister, has claimed that narco-trafficking is the main factor behind the current political instability.

A brief history of Guinea-Bissau:

Image copyright AFP

1446-47: First Portuguese arrive; subsequently administered as part of the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, the Guinea area becomes important in the slave-trade. Guinea-Bissau becomes a separate colony in the Portuguese Empire in 1879.

1974: Independence following a guerrilla war.

1980: Country's first president, Luís Cabral, is ousted in military coup led by João Bernardo Vieira; plans for unification with Cape Verde dropped. The overthrow is the first of many political coups that undermine the country's stability over the next four decades.

2010: US names two top military officials as international drugs traffickers and freezes their US assets. EU announces it is ending mission to reform Guinea-Bissau's security forces, saying lack of respect for rule of law is making this an impossible task.

2011: EU suspends part of its aid to Guinea-Bissau because of concerns over governance and the rule of law. Several months later, thousands take to the streets to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior for his failure to curb rising food prices.

2012: The UN Security Council expresses concern that drug trafficking has increased, and demands a return to constitutional rule.

2020: Umaro Cissoko Embaló takes office

Experts say drug traffickers can profit from the current political chaos, and there were already reports that one notorious trafficker who had previously fled the country was spotted back in Bissau at a downtown hotel last week.

This report was denied by Ibrahima Jalo, an ally of Mr Embaló, who heads the association of 18 political parties which is not represented in the assembly.

""No, no, no… Drug trafficking? In this country? No. Please. The drug trafficking here in Guinea-Bissau was maybe happening before, but it will never happen again.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Vultures are often seen as a portend of death in the region

In the past, the military and navy have been heavily linked to the country's drug trade.

In 2013, US Drug Enforcement Administration arrested the former head of the navy as he was attempting to close a million-dollar cocaine deal going through Guinea-Bissau.

Trafficking reportedly dropped off in Guinea-Bissau after that, but some experts say the recent few years of political crisis have reopened the corridor.

Amidst the chaos, nearly 1,000 hooded vultures were killed in a mass poisoning in the east of the country. Some said it was a bad omen for the country.

The birds were bubbling from their beaks in what the Vulture Conservation Foundation says is the worst mass vulture death event in recent memory in the world.

Fighting in the courts, not with guns

Vincent Foucher, a researcher for the French National Centre for Scientific Research, stresses that the latest iteration of the crisis appears at least for now to be more peaceful than some in the past.

""I think it's quite important to note that the elites have realised that now the competition is fought with and around legal norms. It's not about killing people - well for now - or coups. Let's hope it stays that way,"" he said.

However, all parties insist the law is on their side.

""It's always this thing that in Bissau people bend the law in one sense or another as suits their interests in the position of the moment. The law is bendable and it's not strong enough, not written clearly enough to an extent, and that's part of the problem even though it's not the cause of the problem,"" Mr Foucher added.

Foreign involvement is also complicating the situation.

Senegalese President Macky Sall has been outspoken in his support of Mr Embaló's presidency and his Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Regional troops have been in Guinea-Bissau for years to prevent conflict

The PAIGC has, however, denounced Senegal for what it says is interference in Guinea-Bissau's internal politics and that it wants to control the country's development - or lack thereof - especially when it comes to contentious maritime rights along their shared border.

Regional body Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) has said Mr Embaló's inauguration was outside the legal framework. A claim Mr Embaló's supporters rejected.

Still dreaming of a better future

Meanwhile, young people in the country lament that the political crisis in the country has lasted their entire lives.

Teachers and healthcare workers have been on strike since late last year, and many in the capital express a desire for the international community to intervene.

,Formula E keen to expand operations in Africa,"Marrakesh staged Africa's annual E-Prix race on 29 February

Electric motorsport series Formula E is seeking to expand its operations in Africa, the sport's founder Alejandro Agag has told the BBC.

The series currently has just one race in Africa - with Morocco's Marrakesh hosting one of the season's 14 rounds - but this could be two within the next ""12-24 months"".

The championship has not featured an African driver since it started in 2014, but there are also plans to change this.

""One of the locations we're talking to is Cape Town,"" Agag told BBC Sport Africa.

""We have some people there working to see if we can make it happen. There's a great location there around the football stadium, so that would be one of the options we're looking at.""

Marrakesh has staged a race since the 2016, the third season of a championship which started in 2014, and the sport is keen to expand further.

""Africa is a key continent where growth is happening and is going to happen,"" said Allan McNish, the team principal of Audi Sport.

""For the moment, Marrakesh is our home in Africa but we are actively looking for other cities, which doesn't mean we'll stop doing Marrakesh.

""We could do two cities in Africa - and that's a priority for us. I would suggest in the next 12-24 months, you're going to be going to a lot more races on the continent.""

Formula E organisers are considering a race near to Cape Town's Green Point Stadium

African Driver

While Formula E is looking to expand the number of races in Africa, officials also say they are ""actively looking"" to find the first African driver in the series.

None of the 12 teams, who have two drivers apiece, competing this year have one, nor have had one in the past.

""I think having a local hero on the track is very important to attract fans and to really have a connection with the fans,"" Spaniard Agag added.

""So we will need African drivers to be good and to be competitive. [If they could] be up there fighting for victory, that would be fantastic.

""Of course we're looking - for the moment, we don't have one - but definitely it would be fantastic to have one and we're actively looking.""

Formula E founder Alejandro Agag says an African driver is being 'actively' sought

South Africa's Kelvin van der Linder is one driver harbouring dreams of competing in Formula E.

In Marrakesh on 1 March, the 23-year-old competed in the Formula E rookie test, which took place a day after the E-Prix.

The rookie test is an introduction to Formula E cars for drivers who have never contested an E-Prix and who do not hold a licence to compete in the sport.

""The dream for me is to get to the top level of motorsport and right now, that's Formula 1 or Formula E,"" Van der Linder told BBC Sport Africa.

""There's not many in the world that get the chance, especially at a high level such as Formula E.

South Africa is the country that provided the last African driver in Formula 1, with Jody Scheckter - who quit the sport in 1980 - having won the title itself in 1979.

The last Formula 1 race to be held in Africa was also South Africa-based, with the Kyalami track staging the 1993 Grand Prix.

Kyalami is located just north of Johannesburg, where a Formula 1 festival is scheduled to take place at the end of the month.

,"David Rudisha: Olympic 800m champion on personal struggles, and Tokyo comeback","David Rudisha, pictured in December 2018, attending an event known as the 'Maasai Olympics' at Kimana, near Kenya's border with Tanzania

Snoozing in Nairobi airport's departure lounge in a navy blue suit, David Rudisha looks like just another businessman having a quick power nap.

His fellow passengers seem pretty relaxed about being in the presence of Kenyan running royalty. My feelings are a little different.

Appropriately for a man who has hardly been seen or heard from in the past three years, the two-time Olympic 800m champion Rudisha has been difficult to track down.

But now here we are, finally face to face with the man who, for some, outshone Usain Bolt at London 2012. It's a fuller face than you might remember.

By his own admission, the 31-year-old has changed a lot since that incredible world record of one minute 40.91 seconds he set in winning Olympic gold, before defending his crown four years later in Rio.

The initial problem was injury. A long-term issue with the tendon that attaches to the sitting bone means he has not run competitively since 4 July 2017.

But Rudisha has had to cope with a lot more than that.

Marital problems, separating from his wife, plus the death of his father Daniel - himself an Olympic medallist - last year left Rudisha looking for ""a bit of destruction to distract"".

To release the pressure valve, he was ""partying too much"". When the injuries finally subsided and he was able to return to running in November, he did so two stone overweight.

And then there is the reason why Rudisha feels he is living a ""second chance"" at life. He could easily have died last summer.

Five hours into a six-hour drive to his family home in Kilgoris, south-west Kenya, Rudisha rounded a corner late at night to be confronted by a bus on his side of the road. They collided head-on.

His car was a write-off. Recalling the memory, he recoils in his seat.

""Actually I don't even have words to explain the accident,"" he says. ""It was really horrific and scary. It was not easy and everybody, every time, kept asking me: 'How did you even survive? How did you get out of that car?'

""To come out without a single scratch was just like a miracle. It is not something that happens every day, it was so special and I feel like God still loves me.""

All of this explains why reducing weight, rather than lap times, is still top of the to-do list. However, a big goal is back on the table: the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Rudisha is one of four men to win consecutive 800m Olympic titles. Nobody has won three - at all, let alone in a row.

""I still feel like I still have something in me. I have not exhausted everything,"" he says.

""There is something left in the tank and that is what I want to exhaust before I think of doing other things.

""If you saw me one month ago I was a little bit heavier, but now I am losing the weight and the response is pretty good. The routine is back. When you miss out on training and competition for two years it is never easy…""

Rudisha trails off. The question of what could happen if the old magic returns is left hanging.

It's a tantalising thought. This is the man who after all, according to chairman Lord Coe, delivered the best performance of the entire London 2012 Olympics.

""Bolt was good, Rudisha was magnificent,"" Coe said. ""That is quite a big call but it was the most extraordinary piece of running I have probably ever seen.

""He had the balls to go in there and think: 'I am so much better than anyone else that I could [run a world record].' In Olympic finals you are not supposed to gamble with the till, but he did.""

Rudisha circa 2020 is more circumspect.

The impact of three years of back-to-back injuries undoubtedly informs his current mantra, for which he dips into Swahili: ""Pole, pole (slowly, slowly).

""I have had so many setbacks before so I don't want to rush into anything.

""We are human beings, not machines. You cannot have a spare part of your leg or foot or whatever, but we have also to listen sometimes to our body.

""Don't push, just try to be disciplined, doing the right thing at the right time. If the body responds and says yes…""

In an interview with Spikes magazine in October, Rudisha was open about turning to partying as a way to release the pressure he felt from his on and off-track issues.

""With everything else going on in my life, the pressure sometimes got to me,"" he said.

Rudisha's victory in the 800m was one of London 2012's iconic moments

""To release it I'd often hang out with friends, partying too much. It's not something you intend to come your way but sometimes, during periods like that, you look for a bit of destruction to distract yourself.""

Four months later he's a little more defensive.

""Well, I, you know, I have never really directly spoken about partying but, you know, just a social life that everybody has the right to enjoy,"" is how he explains it now.

""Whenever we have a [athletics] meet, sometimes we go to socialise, to go out for instance. That is normal life.

""I never meant anything extreme, because that is not what I do. Mostly I am a very focused person and disciplined. Sometimes when you have friends, you go out and throw a party and so forth, and that is actually what I meant.""

Rudisha's penchant for a post-race party is, of course, entirely natural.

But having spent two days earlier that week getting behind-the-scenes access to marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge's regime the contrast is striking.

Life in Kipchoge's Spartan training camp in Kenya's Rift Valley is all work and no play. Kipchoge - and 30 other athletes - live in dormitories in Kaptagat from Monday to Saturday. Away from their families and other distractions their life is simple. Train, eat, rest, repeat.

""Eliud's discipline is exceptional,"" Rudisha says. ""If you go back, Eliud can give you his training plan for the past two, three years. I don't think I have something like that.""

I ask if that is not his way. Rudisha lets out a big laugh.

""That's not my way. I do things more relaxed,"" he says.

""I do so passionately. Running is something you have to enjoy sometimes. It is hard but you just have to enjoy and you have to make it look like fun.""

To illustrate that more intuitive approach, Rudisha tells an anecdote about his pre-London 2012 training sessions.

His world record time of 1:40.91, set in an Olympic final having already run heats and a semi-final, was arguably as stratospheric as Kipchoge's ""moon-landing moment"" last year when he became the first man to run a sub two-hour marathon.

However, while Kipchoge had a team of hundreds of support staff who left no stone unturned in their search for perfection - climate, diet, training, trainers - Rudisha's key sessions before London 2012 didn't even feature a stopwatch.

""At a certain point I just needed to do some splits with my mind,"" he says.

""I gave Brother Colm [his coach, Brother Colm O'Connell] the watch. If I said I wanted to run 400m in 53, 54, 55 seconds I would do it, without the watch. It was amazing.

""That is how I familiarised myself with timing. It was very natural and that is why I really mastered 800m very well, in such a way that I knew exactly what I was running for the first lap. It was just there in my mind.""

Rudisha defended his Olympic title at Rio 2016 - and is still the 800m world record holder

It's easy to forget that Rudisha defended his London gold in Rio.

In fact, the man himself made the same mistake during our conversation, talking about winning a second, rather than a third, Olympic title in Tokyo.

That hat-trick would be an incredible athletic achievement for anyone. Given Rudisha's considerable issues both on and off the track for the past three years, it would be nothing short of a miracle.

We met with less than six months to go until the Olympics and Rudisha was yet to set foot on a track. He was still building up his baseline fitness with 10-kilometre runs on the dirt roads around his home in Eldoret.

But, crucially, eight years on from his greatest achievement, one of his greatest gifts has returned.

""I am happy,"" he says. ""I missed the track and I missed training for the past two years. Sport is what I loved in my life. Whenever I am out there and training I feel like I am doing what I really truly love, and I am a passionate about it.

""I know I have missed some of my best years and injury has robbed me. But I am looking forward.

""If I make the team, go to Tokyo, qualify for the final and be in that final, yes I will say I will be standing there as a potential gold medallist, or medallist in that event. But before I get there I cannot start counting things that are not ready yet.""

And with that the conversation is over.

""Ladies and gentlemen, flight 8606 to Mombasa is ready for boarding. We apologise for the delay and any inconvenience caused.""

The businessmen and women rush to gate three - visibly restless after what has been a lengthy delay.

Not Rudisha. Ticket in hand, he slowly says goodbye and takes time to pose for a picture before joining the back of the queue.

"['Umaru Fofana', 'Bbc News']",Expelled from the US and now in limbo in Sierra Leone,"Image caption Saren Idaho (L) and Prince Latoya were held for five months in a police cell in Sierra Leone's capital

Saren Idaho said he has no connection to Sierra Leone and had never been to the country until he was deported there from the US six months ago.

""I know nobody here,"" lamented the 55-year-old father of two.

Looking unwell and struggling to walk, he sat down on a plastic chair in his sparsely furnished hotel room in the capital, Freetown. As he was talking he played with a pack of cigarettes and several butts were squashed in an ashtray beside him.

At least this was better than the crowded police cell, where he slept on the floor ""with cockroaches, rats and bed bugs"" for the first five months of his time here.

Prince Latoya, 47, was on the same deportation flight and is in the same situation.

Both men, who had never met before coming to Sierra Leone, were long-term residents of the US. But they say they were originally from the Caribbean, which the US authorities dispute.

Image caption The two men are now staying in a hotel in Sierra Leone's capital

Idaho and Latoya were expelled last August, along with 17 Sierra Leoneans, among other West Africans, who had been convicted of committing crimes in the US.

They ended up on that flight after staff at Sierra Leone's embassy in Washington DC were put under pressure by US officials, according to Isha Sillah, director for the Americas and the Pacific at the foreign ministry here.

She said that the US immigration authorities had submitted documents to the embassy that ""appeared to suggest"" that the two men were from Sierra Leone. Without cross-checking, embassy officials issued them each with an Emergency Travel Certificate (ETC).

Embassy staff had told her that ""what contributed to the issuance of the ETC was also pressure piled on them by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security"" to accept them as Sierra Leoneans.

BBC America forged documents to bring me here. And I know I was not born in this country""

""The Sierra Leone government are like puppets to the Americans,"" Latoya, who said he was originally from the Bahamas, told the BBC.

Idaho was angry with the US authorities.

""America forged documents to bring me here claiming this to be my country of citizenship,"" he said. ""And I know I was not born in this country.

""I am from the Commonwealth of Dominica. What is so hard about returning to the US?""

'Denied by Dominica'

This has now become a massive bureaucratic problem.

The foreign ministry has contacted the two Caribbean countries' embassies in Washington to certify that the two men were born there.

""The Dominican embassy has denied that Idaho is their national while the Bahamian embassy says more documents are needed to enable them make a determination - hence it's inconclusive,"" Ms Sillah said.

Meanwhile, they are stuck in limbo in the hotel.

Image copyright Mowanda Idaho Image caption Idaho, pictured with his children 10 years ago, wants to be reunited with his family

The manager, Osman Kamara, said the men were checked in by the police with an advance payment for their lodging, but that ran out and an anonymous businessman stepped in to pay the bills to stop them being thrown out.

He also paid for a food and clothing allowance.

Before that, they were each getting $2.50 (£2) to cover daily costs, which they said barely paid for breakfast and bottled water.

""We have been living here with no food, no medical care, nothing,"" Latoya said.

Lost ID

The two men had been receiving extra money from relatives sent through Western Union. But as their Sierra Leone travel documents have now expired, they can no longer pick up the cash as a valid photo ID is required.

Idaho said he had been living in the US for 28 years until he was arrested and jailed in 2018 for driving while drunk.

He has lost all his ID documents. They were in a house that was seized by the bank as he was unable to pay the mortgage because he was imprisoned, he said.

""All my possessions, including my birth certificate, are locked in a store somewhere after the takeover of the house,"" he told the BBC.

Image copyright Mowanda Idaho Image caption Mowanda Idaho said that her two sons are missing their dad

His wife of 17 years, Mowanda Idaho, and his two sons, aged 14 and 11, are now living in the US state of South Carolina.

""It has been devastating for me and the two boys with the 14-year-old now living in a state of depression and failing in school,"" Ms Idaho, who is an American citizen, said by phone.

She last saw him for ""a five-minute encounter"" when he was taken to prison in April 2018.

She had spoken to an immigration lawyer who told her that he had heard nothing like her husband's case before. But she says she cannot afford the legal fees to take the authorities to court.

Latoya, who had lived in the US for 25 years, was convicted of identity theft. He said he had no wife or children.

'They said they were from Sierra Leone'

But the US government sees things differently.

In an email to the BBC, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described Latoya as a ""criminal alien who has been convicted of multiple identity theft-related criminal offenses"".

It said that he entered the country illegally in 1997, and ""on numerous occasions, Latoya stated to US immigration officers that he was a citizen of Sierra Leone"".

The Sierra Leonean embassy in Washington confirmed his citizenship, the DHS said.

BBC I never told then I was from Sierra Leone. Ask them to produce anything that said I claimed Sierra Leonean citizenship""

Latoya vehemently denied that he had made any claim to being from Sierra Leone.

""I never told then I was from Sierra Leone,"" he said.

""I don't know where they got this idea from. I went [to the US] by boat from the Bahamas. Ask them to produce anything that said I claimed Sierra Leonean citizenship.""

The US authorities also called Idaho ""a criminal alien"", who entered the country in 1999, adding that he had ""multiple convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol"".

He had told the immigration officials that he was from Sierra Leone, according to the email from the DHS.

""I never claimed Sierra Leonean citizenship,"" Idaho said in response. ""I don't have a multiple criminal record. I have only one conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol.""

As for the idea that the US authorities pressurised the Sierra Leonean embassy into issuing travel documents, the DHS is adamant that this did not happen.

In fact, it said that ""Sierra Leone has a history of refusing to issue travel documents for its citizens"", a situation which put the country under temporary US visa sanctions in 2017.

Waiting for travel documents

But the government here does not think the men are Sierra Leonean. It had wanted to fly the two men to the Caribbean, but without confirmation of their citizenship it now hopes to hand them over to the International Office for Migration (IOM).

The IOM chief in Sierra Leone, Sanusi Savage, said that his agency had not received an official request. He said he had only received phone calls from foreign ministry officials including from the minister, Nabilla Tunis, to help.

""I promised to support them with tickets but upon producing official travel documents and acceptance of their countries of origin,"" he told the BBC.

But that has not happened yet and the two men continue to live at the mercy of bureaucratic bickering.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51585330,BBC,Africa,True
"['Rick Kelsey', 'Newsbeat Reporter']",Babacar Sarr: How did an international footballer become a wanted man,"Babacar Sarr is a 29-year-old footballer who's played in top teams across the globe, including in one of the world's highest paying leagues.

He's also a fugitive, wanted in a rape case in Norway and the subject of an international arrest warrant.

He maintains his innocence and now has dropped off the radar.

Sarr is a Senegalese midfielder who built his reputation in Norwegian football, before playing in the top leagues in Russia and Saudi Arabia.

He was a star player at Molde, a top league Norwegian club he joined in 2016. He played there for about two years when the club was managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - who's now the manager of Manchester United.

'He was the engine of the team'

""Sarr was the engine, the motor of the team in a way,"" says Lars Johnsen, a journalist from Josimar, an independent online football magazine based in Norway.

""He had all these qualities, was good on the ball - everything,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.

But while his career flourished, Sarr faced multiple allegations of rape.

He was first accused in 2015, when he was playing for another Norwegian team. He was accused of raping a woman during an end-of-season trip to Stockholm. Police investigated but didn't press charges.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Molde, where Babacar Sarr lived for three years

After the move to Molde, Sarr faced further accusations of rape. He denies all the allegations against him.

In March 2018, he was charged for the first time, with a rape that allegedly took place at an after-party in an apartment in Molde in 2017.

Newsbeat spoke with the alleged victim who claims she woke to find him ""on top of her"".

Sarr continued to play for Molde before his trial, leading to anti-rape campaigners turning up at the team's matches with banners saying ""No Means No"", and anti-rape chants being sung at games.

After a joint criminal and civil trial, Sarr was found not guilty in August 2018 of the criminal charge.

But he was ordered to pay his accuser compensation of 150,000 Norwegian kroner (around £12,500) after the court ruled in her favour on the civil claim. Both sides appealed against the result.

Image copyright Ingvild Thorn Nordheim Image caption Ingvild Thorn Nordheim is a senior prosecutor in Norway

Sarr's Molde contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2019. At the time, Norwegian papers reported that the club thanked him for his contribution ""through a difficult time for the player as well as the club"".

The prosecution's appeal hearing against his acquittal was set for February 2019. But it had to be delayed, because both the defendant and a witness didn't appear in court.

In Norway, a criminal trial can't go ahead for serious crimes if the suspect isn't there, which is different to the UK.

By this time, he was more than 4,000 miles away, in Siberia, Russia.

'A huge mistake by the police'

In February 2019, Sarr signed for Yenisey Krasnoyarsk, a team in the Russian Premier League.

Following huge investment by wealthy club owners, the Russian league is now the seventh highest-paid football division in the world, so it was a big move for Sarr in his footballing career.

The extradition process between Russia and other countries is known to be complicated.

Then in June last year, just before he was due to appear in court in Norway for the rescheduled appeal hearing, Sarr signed for another club, this time in Saudi Arabia.

Around the same time, it emerged that Norwegian prosecutors had issued an international arrest warrant for him through Interpol, the organisation that helps police across the world work together on serious crimes.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sarr (right) moved from Norway to Russia then to Saudi Arabia

He joined Damac FC, a team on the rise in the Saudi top division, moving to a country where there is no extradition treaty with Norway. That means there was no agreement between those countries to send Sarr back to Norway for his case to be heard again in court.

But then in January, Sarr's contract with Damac FC was suddenly cancelled before the end of the season.

Damac didn't respond when Radio 1 Newsbeat asked why that was.

Around the same time, it emerged that he'd been charged with a second rape - one that was alleged to have taken place in Oslo, at Molde's end-of-season party in November 2018.

That second charge was recently dropped because Oslo police failed to notify Babacar Sarr within three months after being asked by prosecutors - the time limit allowed under Norwegian law.

The Oslo state prosecutor's office told us that the police were ""unsuccessful in their attempts at serving the indictment on Mr Sarr"".

This has been described by a senior law professor at the University of Bergen as ""a huge mistake by the police"".

Oslo police responded to Newsbeat saying they were unable to comment on cases that have been transferred to prosecutors.

Image copyright Josimar / Damac FC Image caption Damac FC in Saudi Arabia welcomed Babacar Sarr in June 2019 in a tweet

It's from January this year that Sarr's whereabouts become less clear.

No other club appears to have signed him.

There have been no sightings of him since the last of his 13 games with Damac.

A tweet that Damac had posted celebrating Sarr joining when he was signed last year appears to have been deleted, and Newsbeat could find no other references to him on the club's account.

Sarr's Instagram account, which was public, is now private.

Sarr's story has been in the news last month after one of his alleged victims told the Daily Telegraph that she thinks Solskjaer is ""not fit to lead"" Manchester United after his decision to keep playing Sarr at Molde after his original charge.

She thinks that football players charged with sexual assaults should not be allowed to continue playing until the case has been resolved.

""It's about the signal it sends, especially when it's someone's kids who looks up to them,"" she says.

Manchester United told The Telegraph that Solskjaer fully respected the due process of the Norwegian legal system.

In response to this case, UK campaigners have called for football clubs to suspend players if they are on trial for serious sexual offences.

'Nothing strange about this situation'

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The midfielder Babacar Sarr when he played for Molde

With no club linked to him, Sarr's whereabouts are unknown.

Norway's state prosecutor, Ingvild Thorn Nordheim, issued the international arrest warrant.

She says Sarr and his lawyers haven't answered any communication from her.

Newsbeat has seen court documents showing Norwegian prosecutors asking Saudi Arabian officials where he is, but receiving no concrete answers.

Lars Johnsen, says all the indications are he's still in Saudi Arabia, but he can't be sure.

""I have to say Saudi - but I don't know,"" he says.

""He might be in Senegal.""

He believes Sarr will be looking for his next move and may soon leave Saudi Arabia if he hasn't already.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sarr moved to Krasnoyarsk to play in the Russian Premier League - sometimes known as the prettiest city in Siberia

For now, his location - as well as whether he'll come back to Norway to face the appeal - are a mystery.

Sarr's lawyer, Yvonne Larsen, told Newsbeat the issue of the first rape has been ""dealt with already"" because Sarr was found not guilty at his first trial.

She added that Sarr continued to play football while he was charged because ""everyone is innocent until guilt is proved by the law, and Mr Sarr is still innocent"".

""There is nothing strange about this situation at all.""

As for one of the alleged victims, she has decided to move away from Molde.

She ""doesn't get her hopes up that the appeal will happen"" and wants to rebuild her life in another city.

Mr Hancock told the BBC manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS, and hotels could be turned into hospitals, Mr Hancock said.

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care.

Earlier, 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"", following Mr Matthews' death at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

She said she and her family were ""currently in isolation"" until they received their coronavirus test results back and urged people not to visit them until they got the all-clear.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had recently returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, flying out on February 22 and returning on February 29.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are not being tested, with the government prioritising tests for those ""most at risk of severe illness"".

Tests will primarily be given:

To all patients in critical care for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

To all other patients requiring hospital admission for pneumonia, ARDS or flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

Earlier, Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would be told within weeks they needed to remain at home, with groceries and vital medication delivered - but he did not give details about how long this would be for or when it would start.

Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends so long as they stayed two metres - or six feet - apart from them.

All the UK deaths from the virus so far have been among people aged over 60 or with underlying health conditions.

The Scottish government set out its interpretation of the strategy, saying it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.

""What we're saying to them is, reduce your contact.""

The Scottish government has also published its guidance that gatherings of 500 people or more should not take place in Scotland.

Although it does not have the power to call off events, it has urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" in cancelling large gatherings from Monday to help the efforts of emergency services.

'Start making more ventilators'

Manufacturers including car makers, weapon makers and army suppliers are to be asked to switch their production lines to making ventilators for use in hospitals treating coronavirus - which can cause severe breathing problems.

Digger manufacturer JCB said it has been approached by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to see if it could help with the production of ventilators.

The company chairman, Lord Bamford, said it was ""unclear as yet"" whether it could assist, but its research and engineering teams were ""actively looking"" at the request.

The health service is to stop non-urgent surgery and implement a huge training programme to retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those who become seriously ill with the Covid-19 disease.

What is a ventilator?

A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide

Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery

A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy)

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment, but that many times that number would be needed.

Work is also under way to buy up thousands of private hospital beds to boost NHS capacity should it be needed and the possibility that empty hotels may be requisitioned has not been ruled out.

Mr Hancock earlier used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to liken the coronavirus crisis to World War Two.

He wrote that, despite the Blitz, the UK ""pulled together in one gigantic national effort"" and that the same must happen once more.

It came as the government's strategy was criticised by some scientists, who wrote to ministers urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

""Of course there is a scientific debate around scientific concepts but I want to be absolutely crystal clear, we will do what is necessary,"" Mr Hancock said.

An emergency bill giving the government temporary powers to tackle the outbreak will be published next week.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the government is ""well behind the curve"" in its management of the outbreak and urged No 10 to give ""clearer guidance"" and ""much better support"".

He insisted the government had not acted ""fast enough"" to tackle the virus, citing concerns over the availability of NHS beds, ventilators and staff.

He said he had written to Mr Johnson demanding a meeting and to ask what would be in the emergency legislation that is to be presented to Parliament next week.

Why and when should vulnerable self-isolate?

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks or so.

That's why it's essential people don't go too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self isolating.

But the officials recognise that individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus: Some scientists say UK virus strategy is 'risking lives',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's nuanced approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

In an open letter, the 229 specialists in disciplines ranging from mathematics to genetics - though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases - say the UK's current approach will put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"".

The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune.

The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

The scientists - all from UK universities - also questioned the government's view that people would become fed up with restrictions if they were imposed too soon.

Their letter was published on the day it was announced 10 more people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21.

Meanwhile the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advised that measures to protect vulnerable people - including household isolation - ""will need to be instituted soon"".

Sir Patrick and the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, have said they intend to publish the computer models on which their strategy is based.

The UK's approach to coping with the coronavirus pandemic has been in stark contrast to other countries. The whole of Italy has been on lockdown since Tuesday, while Poland is set to close its borders for two weeks.

On Saturday the French government ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday).

And Spain has declared a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle the virus,

Measures 'insufficient'

In the open letter the group of scientists argue that stronger ""social distancing measures"" would ""dramatically"" slow the rate of growth of the disease in the UK, and would spare ""thousands of lives"".

The group, specialising in a range of disciplines, ranging from mathematics to genetics, though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases, said the current measures are ""insufficient"" and ""additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately"", as is happening in other countries.

On Friday, Sir Patrick suggested managing the spread of the disease so that the population gains some immunity to the disease was a part of the government strategy.

This idea, known as ""herd immunity"", means at-risk individuals are protected from infection because they are surrounded by people who are resistant to the disease.

Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease.

But in the open letter, the scientists said: ""Going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option.""

'Laissez-faire attitude'

The major downside of herd immunity, according to Birmingham University's Prof Willem van Schaik, is that this will mean that in the UK alone at least 36 million people will need to be infected and recover.

""It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths,"" he said.

""The only way to make this work would be to spread out these millions of cases over a relatively long period of time so that the NHS does not get overwhelmed.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Willem Von Schaik, professor of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, was one of the signatories

Prof van Schaik noted that the UK is the only country in Europe that is following what he described as its ""laissez-faire attitude to the virus"".

But a Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said that Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic. Our aims are to save lives, protect the most vulnerable, and relieve pressure on our NHS,"" he said.

""We have now moved out of the contain phase and into delay, and we have experts working round the clock. Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence.

""Our awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible.""

In a separate letter to the government, more than 200 behavioural scientists have questioned the government's argument that starting tougher measures too soon would lead to people not sticking to them just at the point that the epidemic is at its height.

""While we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about 'behavioural fatigue' or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,"" the letter said.

""Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it.""

""In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. Carrying on as normal for as long as possible undercuts that urgency,"" it added.

The scientists said ""radical behaviour change"" could have a ""much better"" effect and could ""save very large numbers of lives"".

""Experience in China and South Korea is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that this possibility should at least be attempted,"" it added.

The second letter called on the government to reconsider its stance on ""behavioural fatigue"" and to share the evidence on which it based this stance.

,PrEP: Preventative HIV drug available in England from April,"Image copyright Getty Images

A drug that prevents the transmission of the HIV virus will be available in England from April, the Department of Health has confirmed.

PrEP - or pre-exposure prophylaxis - is an antiretroviral medicine which, taken once a day, stops the transmission of HIV during unprotected sex.

The pill is already available in Scotland and Wales to people at risk of contracting the virus.

It is estimated there are about 103,800 people living with HIV in the UK.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the roll-out of the drug in England would eliminate new HIV infections within 10 years.

NHS England will pay for the drug.

The cost is estimated to likely be much less than the lifetime bill for treating those who already carry the virus.

The Terrence Higgins Trust, a charity that supports those living with HIV, estimates that about 7% of the roughly 103,800 people living with the virus in the UK do not know they are HIV positive.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'People think using PrEP means you put it about'

Ian Green, Chief Executive at the Terrence Higgins Trust, described the development as a ""game-changer"" for HIV prevention.

But he said more work needed to be done to ensure the benefits of PrEP were made clear to groups other than gay and bisexual men, such as women, trans people and BAME communities.

Sir Elton John, whose foundation supports HIV prevention and treatment, welcomed the government's decision.

""Taking PrEP prevents HIV from being passed on, which is truly incredible,"" he told the Sunday Times.

""It is the right decision for the UK government to roll this out more widely to minimise the spread of this disease so more people are protected - which is critical in fighting any epidemic.""

What is PrEP?

A pill taken daily, or on demand prior to having sex, to prevent HIV infection

If taken consistently, when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV, it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying

A UK Medical Research Council-run study comparing gay men on PrEP against non-users found an 86% fall in new HIV infections in PrEP users

Many in the sexual health sector say PrEP, when taken correctly, is almost 100% effective

It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk, including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed

Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections

But PrEP does have its critics, with some commentators saying funding it will lead to an abdication of personal responsibility, with men choosing not to use condoms.

Unlike condoms, PrEP does not protect against other sexually-transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea - of which the numbers of infections are rising.

In 2018, new HIV diagnoses in the UK fell to their lowest level since 2000 - 4,484 people - due to the success of preventative measures, Public Health England said.

The decline has been attributed to a mix of prevention methods, such as testing, condom provision, and the wider use of PrEP.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51897856,BBC,Health,True
,Coronavirus: Planned surgery cancelled in Wales,"Image copyright sudok1/Getty Images

Planned surgery is to be cancelled in Wales as the NHS gears up to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.

On Saturday, Public Health Wales said the number of cases had risen to 60.

Cutting back on so-called ""elective"" operations - those waiting for non-urgent treatment - had been put forward as one of the likely options as the pandemic escalates and more patients with the virus need treating.

Non-urgent outpatient appointments will also be put on hold.

Waiting time targets and monitoring arrangements are also being relaxed.

Meanwhile, Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies has defended the decision to postpone Wales' Six Nations game with Scotland, just 24 hours before kick-off.

Also, Cardiff City have confirmed a player and member of staff are self-isolating as a precaution, while a Wrexham FC player has been told to self-isolate after seeking medical advice, with the team's weekend game against Barrow postponed.

Image caption First Minister Mark Drakeford, flanked by health minister Vaughan Gething and NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall

Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""I am choosing to act now before we see a significant surge in demand so that our services can be ready to act. A larger number of people requiring high levels of care is highly likely over the coming weeks.""

He stressed that access to cancer and other essential treatments such as kidney dialysis would continue.

The minister said the priority was to save as many lives as possible, with 25,000 deaths in Wales possible in a worst case scenario.

What actions have been outlined?

Suspending non-urgent outpatient appointments to ensure urgent appointments were prioritised

Suspending non-urgent surgical admissions and procedures - but ensuring access for emergency and urgent surgery

Prioritising the use of non-emergency patient transport to focus on hospital discharges and ambulance emergency response

Expediting discharge of vulnerable patients from acute and community hospitals

Relaxing targets and monitoring arrangements across the health and care system

Minimising regulation requirements for health and care settings

Fast-tracking placements to care homes by suspending the current protocol which gives to right to a choice of home

Giving permission to cancel internal and professional events, including study leave, to free up staff for preparations

Relaxing contract and monitoring arrangements for GPs and primary care practitioners

Suspending NHS emergency service and health volunteer support to mass gatherings and events

EASY STEPS: How to keep safe

With the peak believed to be 10 to 14 weeks away, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was about making the ""right decisions at the right time"".

Earlier on Friday, the Welsh Government hinted at the move, saying it would need to consider reducing planned activity.

There are currently about 390,000 referrals waiting for hospital treatment in Wales - including some patients on multiple waiting lists. These include 47,000 orthopaedic referrals.

There were also 3 million outpatient appointments in the past year.

This could mean some quite big operations, including heart surgery, will be postponed for people - particularly if patients require intensive care afterwards.

But clinical decisions will have to be made if the conditions of patients deteriorate as they wait and they become emergencies.

We are used to seeing the temporary cancellation of planned surgery used as a pressure valve in the NHS by individual health boards, to relieve demand during winter pressures.

But in the wake of this crisis and the anticipated demand, to see this directed centrally by NHS Wales, is unprecedented.

Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""We would ask members of the public to help by being patient and understanding staff are working tirelessly.

""It is important to remember that we all have a responsibility to take precautions to minimise the chances of catching or spreading Covid-19"".

On Wednesday, a senior intensive care consultant warned about the supply of beds and staffing, because critical care units normally work at more than 90% capacity.

Dr Jack Parry-Jones, Welsh board member for the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said Wales was ""uniquely at risk"" if there was a surge of very sick people.

Europe is now the ""epicentre"" of the global coronavirus pandemic, the head of the World Health Organization says.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to use aggressive measures, community mobilisation and social distancing to save lives.

""Do not just let this fire burn,"" he said.

His comments came as several European countries reported steep rises in infections and deaths. Italy has recorded its highest daily toll yet.

There were 250 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 1,266, with 17,660 infections overall.

Spain, the worst-affected European country after Italy, reported a 50% jump in fatalities to 120 on Friday. Infections increased to 4,231.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says a state of alert will come into effect there on Saturday for two weeks.

Controls are also being introduced at an increasing number of borders in Europe, in response to rapid spread of the virus.

Why is Europe the 'epicentre'?

More than 132,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in 123 countries around the world, according to the WHO.

The total number of deaths has reached about 5,000 - a figure Dr Tedros described as ""a tragic milestone"".

""Europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China,"" he said.

""More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic.""

As well as the increases in Spain and Italy, France has now confirmed 2,876 cases and 79 deaths, up from a total of 61 deaths on Thursday.

Germany has seen 3,062 cases and five deaths. There have been 798 confirmed infections in the UK and 11 deaths.

What are European countries doing about it?

Announcing the state of alert in Spain, Mr Sanchez said the government would ""mobilise all the resources of state to better protect the health of all of its citizens"".

It will be able to limit movement, order evacuations, prohibit access to certain places and intervene in industry for up to 15 days.

""Victory depends on every single one of us,"" Mr Sanchez said. ""Heroism is also about washing your hands and staying at home.""

All but ""essential travel"" to parts of Spain should be avoided, says the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Italy has imposed a nationwide lockdown.

Meanwhile, at least 10 other countries in Europe are enforcing border closures, including:

Germany's Bundesliga, the only one of the big five European football leagues still being played, is to suspend games in the top two divisions from Tuesday.

Paris's Louvre - the largest art museum in the world - announced it would close from Friday, as will the Eiffel Tower.

Why Europe could be worse off than China

The number of cases of coronavirus reported every day in Europe has surpassed China at its peak.

But Europe is in a worse position.

The overwhelming majority of China's cases were in one place, Hubei province and those were largely concentrated in one city, Wuhan.

It was dealt with by an authoritarian government that imposed the biggest quarantine in human history.

While there are hotspots in Europe, this is an outbreak across a continent and different countries are adopting very different strategies for dealing with coronavirus.

All these figures are based on cases that have been detected, but scientists fear there could be large outbreaks going on unnoticed in countries that don't have the tools to spot them.

"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus: Why is the UK not shutting schools like other countries?,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's ""nuanced"" approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

Many countries are taking tough measures to crack down on the spread of coronavirus, including school closures, an end to mass gatherings and severe travel restrictions. But the UK has adopted relatively modest control measures.

The differences can be partly explained by the fact some of these countries are further into their epidemics. But it's clear the UK has adopted a more nuanced approach.

Computer simulations indicate the UK is in the early stages of its epidemic which is expected to rise sharply in four weeks and peak in 10 and 14 weeks' time.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, and chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty have made the judgement call that it is too soon to impose severe restrictions at this stage.

Such restrictions might last several months and risk ""self-isolation fatigue"", with people leaving their homes just as the epidemic was at its height. The elderly are particularly at risk of developing severe symptoms. But many of them are already isolated. Cutting them off from their communities at this stage, when the risks are still relatively low, would create unnecessary difficulties for them.

Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty have also advised against the suspension of mass gatherings. Again, their computer models indicate this would be less effective and more disruptive than the measures they have recommended: hand washing and asking people to self-isolate if they show symptoms of the disease.

These measures, if correctly implemented, could cut the peak of cases by 20%, says Sir Patrick.

""People are very much more likely to catch the virus from a family member or a friend somewhere in a small space rather than a big space [such as a sporting stadium],"" he said.

It's the same with school closures. While Ireland, France and Denmark are among a host of northern European countries to shut schools, for the moment at least they remain open in the UK.

Closing schools is effective for controlling serious flu epidemics, but Covid-19 seems to affect children less. There's still a risk, though, they could transmit it to their parents and grandparents. In addition, school closures would take many much needed NHS staff away from their jobs while they look after their children.

The British strategy is to delay the onset of the peak of the disease until the summer months, when the NHS is under less pressure, and to spread the peak of the epidemic to make treatment more manageable. The aim has also been to manage the spread of the infection so that the population builds up some immunity to the virus should it return in successive years.

Efforts to stamp it out too quickly risk leading to the epidemic returning, perhaps during the winter, once the extreme measures have been lifted. This would be a time when the health service was again under pressure.

It is important to stress that this strategy has been drawn up based on evidence and input from many of the world's leading scientists and doctors, many of whom have been involved in controlling the spread of the virus in China and Singapore. And it is notable that no UK epidemiologists - specialists in the spread of diseases - have spoken out in the mainstream media against the UK government's approach.

There are undoubtedly some who do disagree with the strategy. But there is an acceptance by such critics that Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty are the ones in the hot seat, having to make the biggest calls they have made in their professional lives. So the science community is prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and not speak out, for now at least.

"['Robert Cuffe', 'Head Of Statistics']",Coronavirus: Three reasons why the UK might not look like Italy,"Image copyright Reuters

Much of Italy is currently in lockdown as the country's tally of coronavirus deaths has topped 1,000.

The outbreak is putting the Italian healthcare service under immense strain. But will the UK follow this path?

On Thursday, Boris Johnson's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the UK was four weeks behind Italy ""in terms of the scale of the outbreak"" if not ""in terms of the response"".

Does that mean we're four weeks away from a similar fate?

Not necessarily. Here are three reasons why experts believe the UK's epidemic could be different from Italy's, and why the number of cases here means something different.

1. Different early transmission

The number of confirmed cases is not the same as the number of actual cases. It depends on how many infected people are detected.

The epidemics in both countries may be growing at a similar rate now, but early on the UK had more diagnosed cases than Italy. Italian numbers shot up on 23 February, leading scientists to think there was a period when the virus was spreading without being detected.

That gave less room for measures like tracing contacts of those who had fallen ill and isolating cases to slow the spread.

Professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth says that put the health system ""behind the curve"" in controlling the epidemic.

Researchers also warn that the Italy virus testing system has become overwhelmed and is not keeping up with new cases. This means Italy's figures could be falling further behind the total number of actual cases.

And as the UK adds more testing capacity, Prof Whitworth adds, we might see a ""jump in numbers"" - not just a result of greater transmission, but better detection.

2. Italy's epidemic is more concentrated

The pressure on health services also depends on where, and how severe, each case is.

There are good reasons to believe that these factors are different for the two countries. Since the initial spread, most of Italy's epidemic has been concentrated in the northern region of Lombardy, home to just over 15% of Italians.

Lombardy has accounted for almost 60 in every 100 cases in Italy. By contrast, the epidemic, so far, is more spread out in the UK. Like Lombardy, London has about 15% of citizens. But it has a smaller proportion of cases: just under 25 in 100.

So 15,000 cases spread out across the UK might not put the same pressure on hospitals as they would if they were mainly in one city or region.

The UK government is still planning for a time when the NHS will face significant challenges. But that may not be when we catch up with Italy's current number of confirmed cases.

3. More of Italy's confirmed cases are fatal

The death rate among confirmed cases in Italy is higher than in the UK. As of 12 March, the mortality rates among detected cases were 1.4% for the UK and 6.7% for Italy.

Prof Whitworth believes a higher death rate in Italy could mean that the observed cases contain a larger number of sicker patients. Italy has an older population than the UK, and the effects of Covid-19 infection have been more serious in older people.

That puts more pressure on services.

The alternative explanation for the higher death rate is that Italy's is an overwhelmed health service.

Don't relax quite yet

Even though our epidemic may not follow Italy's exactly, that doesn't mean the UK will escape serious changes to its way of life.

Epidemiologist Adam Kucharski warns against simple comparisons of case numbers and that ""without efforts to control the virus we could still see a situation evolve like that in Italy"", even if not necessarily in the next four weeks.

"['James Gallagher', 'Health', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"Coronavirus has spread to more than 140 countries or territories, including the UK, and claimed more than 5,700 lives.

So, what is the disease and how does it spread?

How do I protect myself?

The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.

Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on then your eyes, nose or mouth.

So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important for limiting the spread.

Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts.

What are the coronavirus symptoms?

Coronavirus infects the lungs. The symptoms start with a fever followed by a dry cough, which can lead to breathing problems.

It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.

The incubation period lasts up to 14 days, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days.

People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but there have been suggestions some can spread the virus even before they are sick.

The early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

How deadly is coronavirus?

The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable.

Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported.

A World Health Organization examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests:

6% become critically ill - lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death

14% develop severe symptoms - difficulty breathing and shortness of breath

80% develop mild symptoms - fever and cough and some may have pneumonia

Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. The data from China also suggests that men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.

Treatment relies on keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight off the virus. Work to develop a vaccine is under way.

What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?

The NHS says an epidemic in the UK is ""likely"".

Patients with mild symptoms - such as a new continuous cough or a high temperature above 37.8C- should self-isolate at home for at least seven days, according to the latest advice issued by Public Health England on Friday.

Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.

Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP.

If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. People needing to do so should take ""common-sense"" steps to avoid close contact with other people, says Public Health England.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from affected areas and who may need to self-isolate, has been issued.

Other countries have introduced their own measures For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people showing symptoms to call their healthcare provider, and those who are mildly ill to self-isolate.

The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public.

Who gets tested and how does it work?

In its latest advice, Public Health England (PHE) has said those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms will not be tested.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms will be tested.

If you need testing in the UK, you may have to give samples of mucus, blood or faeces. These will be tested and results may be available on the same day.

While you await your test results, you may be asked to stay at home and self-isolate.

How fast is it spreading?

Hundreds of new cases are being reported worldwide each day. However, it is thought health agencies may be unaware of many cases.

After starting in China, coronavirus is now spreading fast in countries like South Korea, Italy and Iran.

The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.

For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.

So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?

Incubation period

This is when the virus is establishing itself.

Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.

The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.

It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.

At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.

The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Everything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the BBC's Laura Foster

Mild disease

This is all most people will experience.

Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.

Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.

The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.

These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.

The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.

Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.

These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.

This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.

However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.

This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.

Severe disease

If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.

Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.

""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia

Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.

If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.

This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.

This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.

Critical disease

It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.

By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.

The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.

It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.

""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.

And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A patient being treated with an ECMO machine

Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.

This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.

But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.

The first deaths

Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.

The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.

The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.

He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.

He died 11 days after he was admitted.

The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.

He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.

,Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation?,"Image copyright Getty Images

More people in the UK should isolate themselves to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced.

So, what do you need to know about self-isolation and how to do it?

What is self-isolation?

Self-isolation means cutting yourself off from the rest of the world.

You need to stay at home, not go to work, school or other public places, and avoid public transport or taxis, says Public Health England.

""Common-sense"" steps include staying in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keeping away from other people in your home.

Ask for help if you need groceries, other shopping or medication.

It's OK to have friends, family or delivery drivers drop off supplies to get you through.

But you shouldn't have any visitors, PHE says. You can have deliveries left on the doorstep.

Do I need to self-isolate?

From Friday, everyone with flu-like symptoms - defined as a fever of above 37.8C or a persistent cough - is being asked to stay at home for at least seven days.

Anyone who has travelled to an affected area, or who has been in close contact with an infected person, had already been asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

Spending 15 minutes within 2m (6ft) of someone with the virus, or having face-to-face contact, is judged as close contact and a significant risk.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from the main affected areas and some other countries has been issued by the government. Full details of the countries concerned and whether you need to self-isolate are available here.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

The Covid-19 disease can cause a fever, cough and breathing problems. It takes five days on average for people to start showing the symptoms.

What if someone self-isolating shares a home?

If you are self-isolating and share a kitchen, try to avoid using it when other people are there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Clean all the surfaces at home with household cleaning products daily.

Although you might not be able to entirely separate yourself from family members or flatmates, the advice is to limit contact as much as possible.

If possible stay at least 2m (6ft) from other people you live with and sleep alone. Keep away from vulnerable people.

People living with someone in isolation should wash their hands often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds - especially after coming into contact with them.

You shouldn't share towels, toiletries or other household items with someone in isolation and they should have a separate bathroom. If that is not possible, the isolated person should use the bathroom last, cleaning it thoroughly afterwards if they are able.

Any rubbish that the isolated person has been in contact with should be double-bagged and kept. If the person tests positive, you will be told what to do with their waste.

Will I still get paid?

Workers will get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, not the fourth, to help contain coronavirus, the prime minister has said.

This means that people who have to self-isolate or who are ill would get an extra £40 to cover the first four days. This would take it up to its usual rate of £94.25 per week.

Many casual or agency workers may also be entitled to sick pay but self-employed people are not. Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick pay and should ask their employer.

In the meantime, the government says you can claim universal credit or employment and support allowance if you're prevented from working for public health reasons.

If you need to care for a relative or your child's school is closed and you need to look after them at short notice, your employer must give you time off, but it may be unpaid.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,BBC,Health,True
,Coronavirus elderly advice: How can I look after my older relatives?,"Image copyright EPA

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drop-off point to receive samples of the coronavirus for testing at Leeds General Infirmary

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

""We're all reaching that critical point now where we have to take stock and go, if I go to my parents I could be carrying something that could kill them. That's the reality of it.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Some people are wearing face masks although the government does not advise it

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Mental health charity Mind also has tips for those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Age UK's online advice adds: ""The government hasn't said we should stop going out or meeting up with other people.

""Most people can keep doing what they normally do as long as they don't have symptoms and maintain good hygiene practices like washing their hands regularly. You only need to stay at home and avoid contact with other people (called 'self-isolating') if you've been advised to by NHS 111 or a medical professional.""

"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']",Coronavirus: What next in the UK coronavirus fight?,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

,Coronavirus: How many confirmed cases are there in your area?,"Image copyright Getty Images

A total of 1,372 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, with the country now ramping up measures as part of the second stage of the government's phased plan to tackle the outbreak.

Some 40,279 people in the UK have been tested for the respiratory infection so far. Thirty five people who tested positive have died.

If you can't see the look-up click here.

The following maps, charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are dealing with it.

1. The number of UK cases is growing

The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January.

While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase significantly at the beginning of March.

Since then, cases have been reported across the UK, with 232 new cases announced on Sunday.

Most confirmed cases are in England, which has more than 1,000. But Scotland has 153 confirmed cases, Wales has 94 and Northern Ireland has 45.

Confirmed case numbers for the UK are lower than other European countries, such as Italy, for example, where there have been more than 21,000 cases and more than 1,400 deaths, according to 15 March figures from the World Health Organization.

However, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said there are probably between 5,000 and 10,000 people infected in the UK at this time.

He also said that many people will no longer be tested if they are showing mild symptoms. Only those with the most serious symptoms will be given a test in hospital.

England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the UK outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.

Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 140,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 5,700 deaths.

More than half the cases - about 80,000 - are in China, where the virus originated in December.

2. We are in the second phase of the government's response

The government has published its action plan for dealing with the virus, which involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research.

While the emphasis has been on the contain and research phases up until this week, the country has now moved to the ""delay"" phase to stop the wider spread of the virus.

As part of the delay phase, people with even mild coronavirus symptoms - defined as a temperature above 37.8 C or a ""new, continuous"" cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home for seven days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.

Schools are also being advised to cancel trips abroad and people over 70 and those with pre-existing health conditions are being told not to go on cruises.

The delay phase could also mean further ""social distancing"" measures at a later date, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out closing schools at this stage.

Action to isolate the over-70s for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus is planned in the coming weeks, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed.

Government sources have also said mass gatherings might soon be banned to ease pressure on emergency services.

If the virus becomes even more widespread, the government may then decide to enter the third phase of mitigation, when health services are asked to focus on critical care and retired NHS staff could be asked to return to work.

3. People who think they have coronavirus should self-isolate

If you have a ""new, continuous"" cough or high temperature and think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you should self isolate for seven days.

If symptoms persist beyond seven days or if you get worse you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service if you are in England.

In Scotland, you should call your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. In Wales call 111 (if available in your area) or 0845 46 47. In Northern Ireland call 111.

The UK government is now focusing on delaying the spread of coronavirus. But what might an outbreak mean for you, your job and your finances?

Here are the answers to a selection of readers' questions. (Let us know your coronavirus questions by using the form at the bottom of this article).

I run a small business. At what point should I tell people to work from home? - Kieren Johnstone, Horsham

It's really all about following government advice at this stage.

Many firms are already trialling home-working for office-based staff before any potential quarantine. This lets them test home working in a controlled way, before having to do it for real.

As a small business, you'll also need to think about your the way you are supplied, travel and your cashflow.

Also, check your insurance. Does the small print include business interruption cover? If so, does your policy have an extension for ""notifiable diseases""? Also, check if coronavirus is covered.

I'm self-employed. Can I claim benefits if I can't work due to the virus? - Mark Gribby, Nottingham

Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits, Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance.

But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before Universal Credit is paid.

People claiming Universal Credit can be paid early to help them until they receive their first payment. However, this will be taken off future benefit payments.

Unfortunately, those who are self-employed cannot get Statutory Sick Pay because that is paid by an employer.

Ask me

Will lenders be allowing people with mortgages to delay payments during the outbreak? - Clare Waters

Some banks, including NatWest and TSB, are offering customers affected by coronavirus the ability to delay their mortgage payments.

This will be decided on a case-by-case basis, a bit like the process of helping customers in financial difficulty.

Payments will be delayed for two or three months. So, it is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance.

Most probably, any future monthly mortgage bills will be slightly higher.

What will landlords do if coronavirus means people can't pay their rent? - The Urban Troopers via Twitter

At the moment, landlords are not being forced to allow tenants to delay paying their rent.

But they are being encouraged to be sympathetic if tenants have to self-isolate, or are laid off work and take a hit to their income.

The Residential Landlords Association says its members should discuss the problem with tenants, be flexible and arrange for money they owe to be repaid when things return to normal.

Most affected tenants, it says, will be in genuine hardship and suffering stress.

What if you're not on a salary and can't work from home if your workplace closes? - Joseph, Glasgow

If you are employed, your employer has an obligation to pay your Statutory Sick Pay for up to 28 weeks.

Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay Statutory Sick Pay from the first day off.

In the case of small employers, the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days,

Eligible employees are entitled to £94.25 a week.

I am buying a house. What if one party self-isolates after exchanging contracts? - Linda Lawford, Totton

When you exchange contracts for a property, you have made a contract. You would be liable to lose your deposit if you fail to complete the sale and, possibly, face a claim for damages.

In exceptional circumstances, the buyer and seller can agree to delay in completing the sale.

However, self-isolating would not necessarily mean you could not complete. This final step could be done over the phone or online.

At what point will the government advise people not to travel in confined spaces? - Lou Doret, Exeter

When its health experts advise it to do so. However, this might never happen.

For now, transport bosses in the UK say they're reviewing cleaning procedures. Transport for London says it's using a more powerful disinfectant.

Meanwhile, it's been announced that a London Underground train driver has tested positive for coronavirus.

Passenger numbers on trains have fallen as more people work at home.

Will panic buying continue to affect supermarkets? - Thomas, Porthmadog

The issue has been getting stock onto shelves quick enough to fill the gaps as shoppers strip them bare of certain products.

There has been a specific problem with hand sanitisers, where demand has outstripped supply.

But overall, the key message is that we're not going to run out of food. Shoppers should buy what they need.

If things take a serious turn for the worse, all our supermarkets have plans in place to keep us fed. The big challenge will be doing this with potentially far fewer workers.

Image copyright Getty Images

If schools are closed will there be financial help available for parents? - Richard, Eastleigh

Employers have to give you time off to deal with a domestic emergency, but they don't have to pay you.

The time you take has to be a reasonable amount. You can apply for some unpaid leave as well.

And the government has relaxed the rules for applying for benefits if you have coronavirus.

Volunteers are rallying round to help out those isolating themselves to prevent coronavirus spreading in their communities and around the country.

Groups in areas such as London and Cornwall are poised to get supplies to people unable to leave home in the coming weeks to contain Covid-19.

A 17-year-old boy who has set up a volunteer group in London said: ""It's only right that we help out.""

Public Health England (PHE) has advised people to self-isolate safely.

A major coronavirus epidemic is expected in the UK and PHE is working to contain the virus, which has resulted in six deaths and 382 confirmed cases.

The government has outlined emergency legislation to tackle the virus, including measures to allow people to leave their jobs and volunteer to care for those affected.

Image copyright Camel CSA Image caption Charlotte Barry has volunteered to help in her community

Josh St John James, 17 from Kingston in London, set up a group of young volunteers to offer support in any way.

The police cadet has been running Kingston Volunteer Taskforce as he believes young people should be offering to help.

He has been in contact with his local MP and health trust, and so far has four other local cadets willing to help out.

Skip Twitter post by @KingstonVTF2020 We are a team of Volunteer Cadets recruiting and directing young people who would volunteer to help their community as the threat of #COVID19 increases.

Before any volunteering takes place, our primary goal is to unite willing young individuals into one large task force. 1/3 — KingstonVTF (@KingstonVTF2020) March 8, 2020 Report

""I read that someone of our age is more likely to win the lottery than die from coronavirus so it's only right that we help out. You never know when we might need help in the future,"" he said.

""I think lots of people are prepared to volunteer and hopefully our group will give them a place to focus.""

About 50 people have added their names to a database set up by Volunteer Cornwall specifically to help out as more people self-isolate.

Andy Brelsford from the group said it also has an additional 50 people in emergency situations.

""Our worry is that people are being told to self-isolate for two weeks and at the end of that we find out that they haven't had any food to eat or had anything to drink.

""We want to make sure everybody has got somebody to keep them supplied.""

PHE has advised people who are self-isolating to do what they can to avoid visitors to their home and has urged any deliveries of groceries, medications or other shopping to be left at the door.

Charlotte Barry, from Wadebridge, said: ""I am an obvious person to get involved. I'm retired, time-rich, don't fall sick easily and am not in regular contact with anyone who is elderly or has underlying health conditions.

""We have a lot of elderly people in Cornwall. A lot of them have retired down here and so don't have the family backing that locals have.

""So these people are among the most vulnerable as they don't have anybody obvious to fall back on.""

Some volunteers, including in Shropshire are helping health centres deliver medical supplies to patients.

The Bridgnorth Medical Centre said on social media ""we have a small number of volunteers who can visit our most vulnerable patients/collect shopping etc, subject to availability"".

Coronavirus can affect anyone, but people with pre-existing health problems and older people are thought to be at greater risk of developing severe symptoms.

If you have a long-term health condition you may be feeling anxious. So here's what experts are advising.

Who is at risk?

Having a health condition does not make you more likely than anyone else to contract coronavirus, which is a respiratory disease.

But it appears people who are older, those with weakened immune systems and people who have underlying chronic conditions including asthma, diabetes or heart disease are more at risk of severe effects.

Most people recover from coronavirus quickly after a few days' rest. For some people, it can be more severe and, in rare cases, life-threatening. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu:

a cough

a high temperature

shortness of breath

I have asthma, what should I do?

Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your preventer inhaler (usually brown) daily as prescribed. This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.

Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service.

I'm elderly, should I self-isolate?

The latest advice from the government's chief medical adviser is that pensioners currently do not need to be self-isolating.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Older people and their families can also call Age UK Advice for free on 0800 169 65 65.

What if I have a chronic health issue?

Those with underlying medical issues such as high blood pressure, lung complaints and weakened or compromised immune systems are more likely to develop serious illness as a result of the disease.

Anyone with a higher risk from viruses such as cold or flu should take sensible steps to reduce the risk of picking up infections, and call your doctor if you're feeling unwell.

Those who begin to show symptoms should immediately contact their GP or NHS 111 for advice.

I have diabetes, what should I do?

Those living with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes could be at greater risk of more severe symptoms. Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: ""Coronavirus or Covid-19 can cause complications in people with diabetes.

""If you have diabetes and you have symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, you need to monitor your blood sugar closely and call the NHS 111 phone service.""

Should pregnant women worry?

There is no evidence yet that pregnant women are a high-risk group. Like anyone, they should take steps to avoid infection.

I'm a smoker, am I at higher risk?

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of public health charity, Ash, advises that those who smoke heavily should either cut back or try to quit entirely to lower their risk.

""Smokers are more likely to get respiratory infections and twice as likely to develop pneumonia as non-smokers,"" she said.

""Quitting smoking is good for your health in so many ways and smokers should see coronavirus as further motivation to give quitting a go to build up their body's defences now before coronavirus becomes widespread in the UK.""

What about my medication?

It is important that even if you are unwell, you continue to take your prescribed medication. If you need to collect prescriptions while unwell, ask a friend or family member to collect them for you.

Do I need a flu jab?

Coronavirus is an entirely different virus to flu, so the flu jab won't prevent infection, but flu can also make you sick and can be severe in certain people.

If you have not yet had your flu jab there is still time to get one. People aged 65 and over, pregnant women and children and adults with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems can get one for free on the NHS.

So how can I stay safe?

The virus is thought to be spread by coughs and via contaminated surfaces, such as handrails and door handles in public places.

Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading:

Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze

Put used tissues in the bin immediately

Wash your hands with soap and water often - use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available

Try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell

Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean

Should I use a face mask or avoid public places?

The British Lung Foundation says it does not recommend using a face mask ""as there isn't enough evidence to show how effective they are. Also, for people living with a lung condition wearing a face mask can make breathing more difficult.""

"['Robert Cuffe', 'Head Of Statistics']",Coronavirus death rate: What are the chances of dying?,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 50 countries have now confirmed cases

Researchers currently think that between five and 40 coronavirus cases in 1,000 will result in death, with a best guess of nine in 1,000 or about 1%.

On Tuesday, the World Health Organization's Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that ""globally, about 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases have died"".

Scientists' estimate of the death rate is lower because not all cases are reported.

On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK government's ""very best assessment"" was that the mortality rate was ""2% or, likely, lower"".

But it depends on a range of factors: your age, sex and general health and the health system you are in.

How hard is it to work out the death rate?

It is PhD-level hard. Even counting cases is tricky.

Most cases of most viruses will go uncounted because people tend not to visit the doctor with mild symptoms.

The different death rates we are seeing reported around the world are unlikely to be due to different versions of the virus.

According to research by Imperial College, it's because different countries are better or worse at spotting the milder, harder to count cases.

So under-reporting cases makes it easy to overestimate the death rate. But you can also get it wrong in the other direction.

It takes time before an infection results in recovery or death.

If you include all cases that haven't yet had a chance to run their course, you will underestimate the death rate because you are missing the cases that will end in death later.

Scientists combine individual pieces of evidence about each of these questions to build a picture of the death rate.

For example, they estimate the proportion of cases with mild symptoms from small, defined groups of people who are monitored very tightly, like people on repatriated flights.

But slightly different answers from those pieces of evidence will add up to big changes in the overall picture.

If you just use data from Hubei, where the death rate has been much higher than elsewhere in China, then the overall death rate will look much worse.

So scientists give a range as well as a best current estimate.

But even that doesn't tell the full story because there is no single death rate.

What's the risk for people like me?

Even though the death rates among confirmed cases don't tell us about the precise risk in any single group, their patterns can tell us about who is most at risk.

Some types of people are more likely to die if they contract coronavirus: the elderly, the unwell and, maybe, men.

In the first big analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was ten times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged.

The death rates were lowest for the under 30s - there were eight deaths in 4,500 cases.

And deaths were at least five times more common among people with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart or breathing problems.

There was even a slightly higher number of deaths among men compared to women.

All of these factors interact with each other and we don't yet have a complete picture of the risk for every type of person in every location.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At least 621 people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan

What's the risk for people where I live?

A group of 80-year-old men in China could have very different risks to men of the same age in Europe or Africa.

Your prognosis also depends on the treatment you get.

In turn, that depends on what is available and the stage of the epidemic.

If the epidemic takes off, then healthcare systems could get swamped with cases - there are only so many intensive care units or ventilators available in any given area.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronavirus patients in England are being treated at a specialist centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London

Is it more dangerous than flu?

We can't compare mortality rates because many people with mild flu symptoms choose never to visit a doctor.

So we don't know how many cases there are of flu, or any new virus every year.

But flu continues to kill people in the UK, as it does every winter.

As the data evolves, scientists will develop a clearer picture of who would be most at risk should a coronavirus outbreak arrive in the UK.

The basic advice from the WHO is that you can protect yourself from all respiratory viruses by washing your hands, avoiding people who are coughing and sneezing and trying not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth.

With the number of coronavirus patients rising around the world, children are being exposed to information and misinformation from many sources. How can parents best keep them up to date without terrifying them?

""Will I get sick?""

""Will my school close?""

""Will grandma or granddad die?""

Coronavirus is dominating the news and children, as always, are asking direct, difficult questions about what's going to happen.

While the risk of young people being seriously affected by the virus appears low, doom-laden social media posts and playground rumours can induce panic.

Stories of deaths, possible food shortages and school closures, and the circulation of phrases like ""pandemic potential"" can add to a sense of alarm.

Keeping control

So tone is vital when discussing coronavirus with a child, advises Angharad Rudkin, clinical psychologist and consultant on the parenting book What's My Child Thinking?

""We all enjoy scare stories to a degree, but we don't like to hear them quite so much when they're a bit closer to home,"" she says. ""Help your child put some distance between them and the threat by giving information about how coronavirus is spread and what we can do to help minimise the risk such as using loads of lovely bubbles when washing our hands.""

Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus which seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. After about a week, it leads to shortness of breath and some patients require hospital treatment.

Medics aren't sure exactly how it spreads from person to person, but similar viruses do so via droplets, such as those produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

It's essential to talk to a child about things he or she can control, such as disposing of tissues and personal hygiene, Dr Rudkin says, rather than those they cannot.

Once the explanation is over, the conversation should move on to something that ""isn't threatening, such as what they had for lunch or who do they think is going to win the football match this evening"", she adds.

The virus could affect millions of people around the world soon. The UK government says, in its latest plans, that up to a fifth of workers could be off sick at the peak of an epidemic, with school closures possible.

One problem in explaining the virus is that it's difficult to predict what will happen, though early, albeit limited, evidence suggests children with Covid-19 have tended to show mild symptoms.

While parents have long experience in explaining global threats - war, terrorism and climate change - pre-adolescent children are still developing their ability to assess risk, says Dr Rudkin. So it's important to find out what their level of worry over coronavirus is.

""Be clear that you don't know all of the answers but that there are people making decisions for us who have all the information they need.""

Parents, in turn, should be as informed as possible before explaining issues to children, including keeping up with official advice, Dr Rudkin says.

In the event that a boy or girl catches coronavirus, parents are advised not to overplay any risk to their health.

""You could tell them it's 'a bit like feeling sore', so they get to see it's not as dreadful as they might believe,"" Jon Gilmartin, a speech language therapist at the children's communication charity I Can, says.

Older people and those with existing health conditions are thought to be most at risk of death or serious sickness from catching coronavirus. This could lead children to worry about older friends and relatives.

Dr Rudkin advises honesty over the argument ""we will all die eventually but chances are not until we are really, really old"".

Use simple language

""But we can talk about it with a smile and use humour, or at least a lightness of touch, that doesn't then plummet our children into an existential pit they really don't need to be in, until they're 13 at least,"" she adds. ""Reassure your child that you and granddad are really fit and strong and that you will continue to do all you can to keep yourself/granddad healthy and safe.""

Children's capacity to deal with complex and worrying information increases with age, so the way a parent speaks to a three-year-old is very different to dealing with a teenager - and it involves a personal judgement.

But Mr Gilmartin suggests the use of ""simple language"" for all age groups and allowing children to ask ""lots of questions"" to show they're being listened to.

Parents who themselves are looking for the right language to use, could start with the BBC's Newsround coverage.

Children, like the rest of the population, are exposed to myths and misinformation about coronavirus, via playground gossip and, particularly among pre-teens and teenagers, on social media.

The best way to combat this is providing ""age-appropriate information and reassurance"", says Dr Rudkin, as the source young people trust best is a parent.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51734855,BBC,Health,True

Apple's annual showcase, the Worldwide Developers Conference, has been cancelled in favour of an online-only event.

""The current health situation has required that we create a new WWDC 2020 format,"" Apple said in a statement.

The June conference is often used to announce new products and software features.

Only open to Apple software developers, the $1,600 (£1,280) tickets sell out every year.

Apple said it ""will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June...[in] an entirely new online format"".

Full details will follow in the coming weeks, but Phil Schiller, the company's marketing chief, promised ""a full programme with an online keynote and sessions"".

The company will also put $1m (£800,000) towards local organisations in San Jose, California, ""to offset associated revenue loss as a result of WWDC 2020's new online format"".

The annual keynote speech from CEO Tim Cook is usually streamed online each year anyway, to a much larger audience than the one in the convention centre in San Jose.

There had been widespread speculation about the fate of the conference as the world battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Avoiding large gatherings is a key part of much public health advice.

Attendees in previous years have come from all over the globe. Apple says its developer programme includes 23 million people in 155 countries.

Last year's conference saw two major hardware announcements: a new Mac Pro, and the high-end Pro Display XDR monitor. The event also showcases new features coming to Apple's software, such as iOS and macOS.

Apple's physical gathering of thousands is the latest such technology event to be called off because of the coronavirus.

Earlier, the gaming industry's flagship event E3 was called off entirely, with a note that organisers were ""exploring options"" for an ""online experience"" in June.

The Ted conference of talks was also postponed, and organisers considered an online event as a replacement before opting for a later date.

The Game Developers Conference, SXSW, Mobile World Congress, and Google and Facebook's major conferences have also been hit.

Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance.

Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found.

The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns.

Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments.

The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time.

""We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click,"" says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team.

Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day.

""It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals,"" says Ms DeGrippo.

Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours.

If a member of the public clicked on ""access your funds now"", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information.

""Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email,"" says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. ""And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund.""

Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread.

""This little measure can save you,"" they claim.

But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger.

This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online.

To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice.

4. The virus is now airborne

The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission.

It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool.

Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers ""weaponising fear and panic"".

It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic. Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account.

Cofense says the combination of a ""rather good forgery"" and a ""high stress situation"" make for a potent trap.

One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account.

5. Donate here to help the fight

Image copyright Kaspersky Image caption The CDC is not asking for donations in Bitcoin

This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing.

Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware.

,Pentagon to reconsider Jedi $10bn cloud contract,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Pentagon wants to replace ageing computer networks with a single cloud system

The US Department of Defense is to ""reconsider"" its decision to award a multi-billion dollar cloud contract to Microsoft over Amazon.

It comes in response to a court case brought by Amazon Web Services (AWS), claiming the decision was politically motivated.

President Trump had previously expressed concern about Amazon's bid.

In a court filing, the Pentagon said the U-turn was ""in response to.... technical challenges presented by AWS"".

Microsoft said it ""remained confident"" its bid was ""technologically superior"".

In a statement, it said: ""We believe the Department of Defense made the correct decision when they awarded the contract.

""However, we support their decision to reconsider a small number of factors as it is likely the fastest way to resolve all issues and quickly provide the needed modern technology to people across our armed forces.""

Amazon said it was pleased that the DoD had acknowledged the ""substantial and legitimate issues"" with the award decision.

The Pentagon has requested 120 days to reassess the award - its filing was based on pricing and not whether President Trump had interfered in the process.

In July last year, President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair, telling reporters he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"".

He has previously criticised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - who owns the Washington Post.

Only Microsoft and Amazon bid for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure (Jedi) contract and the latter had been seen as the favourite to win.

The new system is designed to replace the DoD's ageing computer networks with a single cloud system, which will host classified secrets and provide artificial intelligence-based analysis to the military.

In October, following a delay, the contract was awarded to Microsoft.

A month later Amazon began an appeal over the decision, saying: ""Numerous aspects of the Jedi evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias - and it's important that these matters be examined and rectified.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51869764,BBC,Tech,True
,Facebook closes African fake accounts targeting US voters,"Image copyright Reuters

Facebook and Twitter have taken down a network of African-based fake accounts linked to previously banned Russian trolls.

The social-media firms say the accounts, based in Ghana and Nigeria, were aimed at US citizens.

They said although none of the activity focused on elections or political candidates, the network had requested to run political ads there.

Twitter said the accounts attempted to ""sow discord"".

An investigation by Facebook, in conjunction with CNN, found some accounts posted as a charity based in Ghana.

The troll factory was run from the headquarters of Ebla (Eliminating Barriers for the Liberation of Africa), near Accra, according to the investigators.

Others posed as blogs or posted in Facebook groups. All of the fake accounts focused on topics such as black history, fashion, celebrity gossip, US news and LGBTQ issues.

Troll factory

They shared negative content about police brutality and oppression. One account posed in a Facebook group as the cousin of an African American who died in police custody, according to CNN.

Facebook said the accounts were relatively new and operating out of Africa on behalf of Russian individuals with links to notorious troll factory the Internet Research Agency.

It said its systems had rejected the requests to run political adverts in the US, and it has taken down 49 Facebook accounts, 85 on Instagram and 69 other pages.

These had about 278,000 followers, with around 65% of these based in the US.

Twitter also removed 71 accounts that had 68,000 followers. It said that the accounts had ""attempted to sow discord"" with conversations about race and civil rights.

Previously banned

In a blog detailing the investigation, Facebook said: ""We're constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don't want our services to be used to manipulate people.

""We're taking down these pages and accounts because this activity was linked to individuals associated with the Internet Research Agency, an entity we had previously banned from Facebook. They also used fake accounts and co-ordinated with one another to mislead people about what they were doing.

""That behaviour was the basis for our action, not the content they posted.""

The Internet Research Agency was accused of running a fake news campaign aimed at disrupting the 2016 presidential election, and in 2018 13 Russian trolls were indicted by the US Justice Department.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51869767,BBC,Tech,True
,Apple's China stores reopen after a month,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China is a major market for Apple - and the closures hit sales hard

Apple has reopened all of its Chinese stores, a month after shutting them down amid the coronavirus outbreak.

All 42 official Apple retail stores opened on Friday, although some stores had special business hours.

It shut the stores in mid-February, as China put several cities on effective lockdown in a bid to contain the virus.

The outbreak has slashed demand for new phones, with Apple selling less than half the iPhones it sold in February last year.

There have also been concerns about the supply of phones for Apple and other manufacturers, as many Chinese factories which make phone parts shut down for weeks.

Foxconn, which assembles Apple's phones in huge factories, said employees had returned to work in numbers that ""exceeded our expectations and imagination"" - and that supplies of parts had returned to normal, too.

But it had its largest drop in revenue in about seven years during the closures.

Apple, meanwhile, sold roughly 494,000 iPhones in China in February - compared to 1.27 million in February 2019.

China recorded just 19 new infections on Tuesday. President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, in a high-profile visit covered by state media.

BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell said the visit was ""like a nationwide green light... a way of sending out a signal that the return to 'normality' should carry on apace.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51870725,BBC,Tech,True

Executives from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook met officials at Downing Street on Wednesday to discuss their role in the coronavirus crisis.

One of the things discussed was their role in ""modelling and tracking data"".

In similar meetings at the White House, meanwhile, companies were asked how they could use artificial intelligence.

A World Health Organization report last month said AI and big data were a key part of China's response to the virus.

Sharing data

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sharing data about the number of cases will be vital to see whether measures to slow the spread are working

Facebook is already working with researchers at Harvard University's School of Public Health and the National Tsing Hua University, in Taiwan, sharing anonymised data about people's movements and high-resolution population density maps, which help them forecast the spread of the virus.

The social network is also helping partners understand how people are talking about the issue online, via tools such as Crowdtangle, which aggregate social-media posts.

In the past, Google search data has been used to track infectious diseases.

To help people who want to track their own health, meanwhile, Google's life-science research arm, Verily is developing a small body-worn temperature patch that transmits data to a phone app.

""This could be especially useful in elderly populations, where viral infections have higher rates of morbidity and mortality,"" blogged chief executive Sundar Pichai.

Fighting misinformation

Image copyright Google Image caption People are turning to Google for the latest information about the virus

So far, there has not been any comprehensive study of how much misinformation remains on platforms such as Google and Facebook but it is likely to be substantial.

Google said its team was ""working round the clock to safeguard our users from phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation"".

Search for coronavirus or Covid-19, and an SOS Alert appears, alongside links to help and information about the virus.

YouTube, meanwhile, is using its homepage to direct users to the World Health Organization and other groups, for education and information, while working to remove videos suggesting alternative cures as soon as they go live.

Finding drugs

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An AI-discovered cure could be quicker than a traditional one but could still take many months

British start-up Exscienta became the first company to put a AI-designed drug molecule to human trials earlier this year.

It took just 12 months for algorithms to create it, compared with four to five years for traditional research.

AI could be used in three ways in the current crisis, according to chief executive Prof Andrew Hopkins:

to rapidly develop antibodies and vaccines for the Covid-19 virus

to scan through existing drugs to see if any could be repurposed

to design a drug to fight both the current and future coronavirus outbreaks

But he warned people to be realistic about what AI could achieve.

""The fastest this could be done is 18 to 24 months away, because of the manufacturing scale-up and all the safety testing that needs to be done,"" he said.

Google-owned AI company DeepMind, meanwhile, has used its AlphaFold system to release structure predictions of several proteins associated with the virus.

These have not yet been experimentally verified but DeepMind hopes this will help the scientific community's understanding of how the virus functions.

Scientists at both DeepMind and Exscienta praised the way those at the forefront of the outbreak had so quickly released data, which would be crucial for any algorithms searching for a cure.

Robot cleaners

Meanwhile, Prof Sabine Hauert, at Bristol University, told BBC News AI could simply make daily life easier during the crisis.

""It can also be used to put people out of harm's way, for example using robots to clean hospitals, or telepresence systems for remote meeting, consultations, or simply to connect with loved ones,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51851292,BBC,Tech,True
"['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Desk Editor']",Apps 'must check images for child abuse before publication',"Image copyright Getty Images

Internet companies must do more to tackle ""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuse on their platforms, a UK-held inquiry has concluded.

The panel also said the technology companies had ""failed to demonstrate"" they were fully aware of the number of under-13s using their services and lacked a plan to combat the problem.

It has called for all images to be screened before publication.

And it said more stringent age checks were also required.

'Reputational damage'

Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were identified as the most commonly cited apps where grooming was said to take place.

And the industry at large was accused of being ""reactive rather than proactive"" in response to the issues.

""Action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children,"" the inquiry said.

The report follows a series of public hearings, between January 2018 and May 2019, during which the police said they believed the UK was the world's third biggest consumer of live-streamed child sex abuse.

'Evil crime'

Facebook was one of the first to respond.

""[We] have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions,"" said its European head of safety, David Miles.

""As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe.""

Microsoft also promised to ""consider these findings carefully"", while Google said it would keep working with others to ""tackle this evil crime"".

Illegal imagery

The report said some steps should be taken before the end of September.

Leading its list is a requirement for screening before images appear online.

The report noted technologies such as Microsoft's PhotoDNA had made it possible for pictures to be quickly checked against databases of known illegal imagery without humans needing to look at them.

But at present, this filtering process typically happened after the material had already become available for others to see.

Officially banned

Users might be frustrated by a delay in seeing their content go live but, the panel said, it had not been told of any technical reason this process could not happen before publication.

The inquiry also said the UK government should introduce legislation to compel the companies involved to adopt more effective checks to deter under-age users.

Pre-teens were at ""particularly acute"" risk of being groomed, it said.

The panel recognised many services were officially banned to under-13s.

Child nudity

But it said in many cases, the only test was to require users to fill in a date-of-birth form, which could easily be falsified.

""There must be better means of ensuring compliance,"" it said.

The report acknowledged detecting and preventing the live-streaming of abuse was difficult but highlighted a French app as an example to learn from.

It said Yubo used algorithms to detect possible instances of child nudity, which a human moderator would then check to see if action if necessary.

Image copyright Yubo Image caption It was suggested the big social networks could learn from a smaller rival, Yubo

The panel also noted existing anti-abuse technologies did not work when communications were protected by end-to-end encryption, which digitally scrambles communications without giving platform providers a key.

The inquiry highlighted WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage and FaceTime already used the technique by default and Facebook intended to deploy it more widely soon.

However, it did not say how this should be addressed.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51851921,BBC,Tech,True

Amazon workers can take unlimited sick days this month - but only those in quarantine for the Covid-19 virus will be entitled to extra sick pay.

Many US warehouse workers are entitled to only 10 days' leave a year - for all holidays, sickness and emergencies.

And some had asked Amazon to change its policy to stop coronavirus spreading.

Some workers also say they are being told increase their hours, known as mandatory extra time, because of increased demand and staff shortages.

'Financial distress'

In a blog, Amazon said: ""The health and safety of our employees and contractors around the world continues to be our top priority as we face the challenges associated with Covid-19.

""Effective immediately, all Amazon employees diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed into quarantine will receive up to two weeks of pay.

""This additional pay while away from work is to ensure employees have the time they need to return to good health without the worry of lost pay.

""This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of March.""

Amazon has also established a $25m (£19.6m) fund to support independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants and seasonal employees ""under financial distress"".

BBC News has had access to an online forum used by about 25,000 Amazon warehouse workers.

And some of those unaffected by coronavirus are clearly relieved they will no longer have to struggle into work when either they or their family are sick.

""My two kids have been sick and last night I felt like death. Now, I can take time off and help the three of us to get better,"" wrote one.

Another said: ""It's allowing me to take a break and get my blood pressure down. My vision started to get blurry... my blood pressure was 176/100[mmHg].""

Those who test positive for the virus will now be guaranteed two weeks' pay.

And one Amazon warehouse worker told colleagues on the forum, the company's previous policy of not offering sick pay had been dangerous.

""Many co-workers live pay cheque to pay cheque and are still going to come into work even if they're sick, which means that coronavirus will spread like wildfire through Amazon, just like all the other sicknesses do,"" they wrote.

One in four US workers - more than 32 million - is not entitled to paid sick days and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics that rises to seven in 10 among low-paid workers.

And even before the coronavirus crisis, Amazon workers had begun to demand better conditions, with more paid time off (PTO) being chief among them.

In some facilities, workers have begun wearing badges saying: ""Amazonians united for PTO"".

""Amazon thinks we're just some stupid workers. But we know our rights, we're organising and we're winning,"" one worker, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51832894,BBC,Tech,True
"['Kevin Peachey', 'Personal Finance Reporter']",Is this the digital future for Bank of England banknotes?,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Digital money would be denominated in pounds, like banknotes

The Bank of England is considering the introduction of electronic banknotes for use by consumers and businesses.

Governor Mark Carney said: ""We are in the middle of a revolution in payments,"" saying the Bank must look into how electronic money could work.

He said this would complement, not replace, paper banknotes while people still wanted physical cash.

But it could open the door to programmable money to integrate with home appliances or the tax system.

Banknotes have been the only way for households to make payments with central bank money for 300 years, a discussion paper published by the Bank says.

The total value of banknotes in the UK economy was close to an all-time high, but people had been making fewer payments in cash, the Bank said.

The governor said fintech firms had begun to offer new forms of money and new ways to pay with it, but it was important to have currency from a trusted central bank.

So, the Bank is considering a Central Bank Digital Currency, which would be denominated in pounds sterling, just like banknotes. So £10 of the digital currency would always be worth the same as a £10 note.

This system would be different from money held digitally in a bank account, or cryptocurrencies. It would be guaranteed by the Bank, rather than a commercial business.

The idea also suggests that consumers would be able to pay for things without all the data about their transactions going to their bank. There would be some anonymity, as there is with cash.

Loading Central Bank Digital Currency would be an electronic version of withdrawing banknotes from an ATM. The Bank stressed this would not replace cash, particularly for those who prefer to use it.

""As long as demand for cash remains, the Bank is committed to meeting this demand,"" the Bank's discussion paper says.

The currency would also be separate from card payments, meaning it would not be affected by technical failures at Visa, Mastercard, or other payment networks.

Payments of the future

The introduction of a digital currency could lead to ""programmable money"", when payments could be integrated with appliances at home or tills at the shops.

Tax payments could be routed to HM Revenue and Customs at the point of sale, the Bank said.

Other examples are shares automatically paying dividends directly to shareholders, or electricity meters paying suppliers directly, based on the amount of power used.

It could also help with very small payments at a lower cost than now, allowing payments such as for a few pence each time to read individual news articles, rather than signing up to a monthly subscription.

Other central banks around the world are investigating the option of issuing digital currency. Interested parties are being invited to respond to the Bank of England's discussion by 12 June.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51851523,BBC,Tech,True

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced the 20% tax on e-books and online newspapers, magazines and journals will be abolished on 1 December.

But the BBC has learned that it will not apply to audiobooks, something that the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said was ""disappointing"".

A letter calling for the tax to be axed was signed by more than 600 authors and presented to Parliament in October.

Physical books and periodicals are already exempt.

In October 2018, the EU allowed member states drop sales taxes on electronic publications and many countries have already made the changes.

""The government expects the publishing industry, including e-booksellers, to pass on the benefit of this relief to consumers,"" the Budget states.

RNIB's head of social change, Sarah Lambert, said it was disappointing that the tax break was not being extended to audiobooks.

""Today's change recognises the unfairness of taxing some alternative formats and will help widen access for blind and partially sighted people who use e-Readers.

""However, for many people living with sight loss, audiobooks are their preferred format and allow them to enjoy their favourite titles in the same way as everyone else. It's not right that they will continue to be charged 20% more for books and we urge the government to make sure that audiobooks are included in the exemption.""

Publisher 404 Ink tweeted the ""huge"" decision would allow it to sell e-books from its website again.

Jim Waterson, media editor at the Guardian newspaper, estimated the move could benefit News UK - publisher of the Sun and Times papers - by £20m, if it kept the cost to consumers the same rather than passing on the saving to subscribers.

A 2018 report by the Publishers' Association estimated universities, libraries, government departments and the NHS would save up to £55m a year as a result of ditching VAT on digital publications.

In response to the news, it said: ""We are delighted that the government has decided to zero-rate VAT on digital books and journals in the Budget. It's fantastic that the Chancellor has acknowledged the value of reading.

""The decision to axe the reading tax will bring an end to the illogical and unfair tax on those who need or prefer to read digitally and should contribute to an increase in literacy in the UK.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51832899,BBC,Tech,True

The world's biggest gaming event, E3, has been cancelled over fears surrounding the spread of coronavirus.

The event, due to take place 9-11 June in Los Angeles, had been highly anticipated, ahead of PlayStation and Xbox console launches later this year.

Organisers said it had been cancelled ""after careful consultation"" over ""the health and safety of everyone in our industry"".

And they were ""exploring options"" for an ""online experience"" in June.

""This might lead to some permanent change to events like E3,"" said Piers Harding-Roll, from Ampere Analysis.

Such major expos ""were already struggling to define themselves in the rapidly changing landscape of games"" he said.

""Next year, E3 may well be quite different.""

The hype train derailed

Analysis by Marc Cieslak, gaming reporter

Got a new game to tell people about? Do it at E3. Got a new console to flog? E3 is the first stop the hype train calls at.

Over the course of its life, E3 has morphed from a trade-only event that helped retailers to figure how many physical copies of a game they wanted to buy, into a circus of organised chaos.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Monster Hunter photo booth in 2019 attracted plenty of attention

In recent years, the public has been allowed in, hoping to catch a glimpse of (or spend hours queuing to play) a pre-release game demo on the show floor. Multi-million dollar press conferences became the norm.

But industry observers have suggested that E3 has struggled to remain relevant in the last few years.

Opening up to the public was part of an attempt to regain some former glory. But the harsh reality is that E3 is an expensive show to exhibit at, costing many millions of dollars for those that do.

Some big brands would rather create their own events, promoting only their own products - a trend that doesn't look like it's going away any time soon.

Sony, which is launching its Playstation 5 console in time for the Christmas season, had already decided not to attend, for the second year in a row.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gamers play together on the show floor at E3 2019

Nintendo has also shifted to making its announcements in a global online live-stream - but, like many developers, it has maintained a presence at E3 for hands-on demonstrations.

Those are open to the public - and often involve game controllers being passed from person to person as thousands mingle on the show floor.

Microsoft's Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, tweeted that while the company had planned on appearing at E3, it would now hold a digital event.

Latest casualty

Dozens of major technology events have been cancelled in recent weeks as the virus has spread around the world and public health officials have warned people against gathering in large numbers.

The Game Developers Conference, SXSW, Mobile World Congress, and Google and Facebook's major conferences are among the casualties.

Major events that have yet to be cancelled include:

Bafta Games Awards: The British Academy awards ceremony, on 2 April, in London

The British Academy awards ceremony, on 2 April, in London WWDC: Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, on 3-7 June, in San Jose, California

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, on 3-7 June, in San Jose, California NAB: The annual broadcaster and media trade show, on 18-22 April, in Las Vegas,

Other events, such as the Ted talks series, have been postponed or shifted online.

'Upload demos'

The gaming media was left frustrated with organisers after the personal information of more than 2,000 journalists was published on E3's website last year.

""I wouldn't be shocked if we look back at 2020 as the year E3 died.""

Meanwhile, Brian Crecente, a former games journalist turned consultant, said: ""Why not have E3 without the E3?""

"['Adrienne Murray', 'Technology Of Business Reporter']",Are female urinals the answer to queues at the loos?,"Image copyright La Voix du Nord Image caption Toilet queues spurred Nathalie Des Isnards to start her company making women's urinals

A few years ago, Nathalie Des Isnards was attending a music festival with her husband David, and planning to watch her favourite group.

Before the show, they headed to the toilets. ""I spent 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pee,"" she recalls. Much to her frustration, she missed the first part of the concert.

Meanwhile David took just ""two minutes"", and saw the whole show.

""I was upset. I told myself, 'We're in the 21st century, something should be done about that.'""

She set about creating a women's urinal. The simple seatless basin she devised is housed in a cubicle with roof and door, designed for faster use but also privacy. ""I was not a designer. I was a user first,"" says the 46-year-old.

Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

However, thanks to social media, and growing competition between event organisers, she thinks the issue is getting more attention.

""[It] forces them to offer better services,"" she explains. Also, organisers now realise, when women are queuing, they're not spending money.

Des Isnards says 100,000 women used madamePee last year, at 15 events across France, including the Women's World Cup. ""It fits all women, not only young ones open to innovation.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption MadamePee hopes women's urinals will lead to shorter queues at events such as festivals and marathons

Two units have been also been installed in Paris as public amenities, she says. This year the loo will be in several other countries.

""The ambition is very clear. It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,"" says the French entrepreneur.

Even newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.

Copenhagen-based architects, Gina Périer and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.

""It's just insanely more efficient,"" says Ms Périer, 25.

The idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival. ""I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,"" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. ""There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.""

Image copyright Eric Delafosse Image caption Lapee is 'insanely more efficient' say its creators

According to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate.

The team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.

Getting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. ""We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,"" she tells me.

Lapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.

Ms Périer says Lapee is also targeting, ""public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.""

The start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year.

They're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.

Other urinal products have launched with varying success.

Perhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up.

Sam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.

""The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,"" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further.

Mr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.

Gail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.

""It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,"" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.

""Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption Research suggests women take up to twice as long to use toilets

Women typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned.

""We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,"" Ms Ramster says.

""Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.""

Researchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times.

But the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women.

""For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,"" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. ""This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].""

It could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676,BBC,Tech,True
"['Dougal Shaw', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']",Does being 'TikTok famous' actually make you money?,"Image caption Jake Sweet, also known as the Tiktok star Surfaceldn

When I meet up with Jake Sweet (aka Surfaceldn on TikTok), he's buzzing.

He's about to be flown out to the MTV Video Music Awards in Spain as a special guest. Dinner will be laid on, he explains, and there will be aftershow parties where he will rub shoulders with music's biggest stars - but best of all, says the 21-year-old, he will hang out with other social media influencers he admires.

He got his invite because he has just over three million followers on the TikTok video sharing app (more than twice as many as pop star Dua Lipa). His presence at the event will boost its profile, as well as his own.

But once the party's over, it will be back to Earth with a bump. He will return to lectures at the University of Nottingham.

When not working towards his degree, Jake makes fun, craft-based videos on TikTok, with a sideline in pranking. For instance, he once surprised his brother by filling his duvet with popcorn.

But he's best known for customising trainers, and for his tricks with orbeez, colourful pellets that change size in water.

He started on TikTok just to have fun with his friends back in November 2018. His videos achieved tens of thousands of views almost immediately, so he threw himself into it.

Now meet Felicity Harfin (aka @refelicity) and her boys.

Image copyright Harfin Family Image caption The Harfin family Tiktok stars

Felicity lives in Edinburgh and works in marketing - or at least she used to.

She discovered TikTok last year and decided to make some fun videos. Things really took off when she included her two sons.

Over summer she did a ""prank-a-day"" marathon called ""Taking revenge on my kids"". This included pretending to trap her hand in a car door and tricking them into smearing baked beans on their faces.

Half-way through the series, her videos were consistently getting two million views, and one achieved 13 million.

She now has 1.8 million followers and TikToking has practically become her full-time job.

TikTok is a Chinese-owned social media app that allows you to share short videos. The international version of the app has more than one billion users. In 2019 it was the second-most downloaded app globally, after WhatsApp.

The platform is owned by ByteDance and morphed out of the lip-syncing app Musical.ly. Music remains an important part of the experience - posts can be set to snippets of the latest commercial releases.

What sets TikTok apart from other social media platforms is the way it finds videos for you. As well as seeing videos posted by friends, users are recommended videos by the company's software algorithm.

Unlike Facebook, which recommends content based on your friends' activity, TikTok delves deep into users' behaviour on the app to figure out their tastes. Make the right kind of content and you can potentially reach millions of eyeballs.

And this explains a big reason for TikTok's appeal. In theory anyone can become ""TikTok famous"" - you don't have be a reality-TV star, or celebrity sportsperson to make viral videos.

Add to the equation the app's hashtag challenges and the experience becomes like a talent show.

On established platforms like YouTube and Instagram, influencers have made millions through advertising revenue and paid promotions. So can everyday influencers who crack the TikTok code make money, considering its vast reach?

Image copyright other Image caption Jake filled his brother's duvet in one popular prank video

Jake earns a small but steady income from TikTok which helps him at university - it's enough for things like groceries. But most of the money he makes gets spent on props for his next videos, he says.

Doing several videos a day is time-consuming - even his 15-second videos can take up to an hour to record. He has to put in an ""extra shift"" to make sure his university studies don't suffer.

But he gets lifestyle perks like party invites, and the experience of being a social media celebrity.

""I do get some money through promotions,"" he explains. ""I've done work with people like Amazon Music, rappers Trippie Redd and Juice Wrld.""

""They say we need you to promote this song, by doing a video along these lines, and then I put my own creative interpretation into it.""

Image copyright Harfin Image caption A memorable Harfin family video involved pretending to trap Felicity's hand in a car door

Jake gets his paid work through a company called Fanbytes, one of the digital agencies which have sprung up to service influencers.

Well-known early agencies of this kind include OP Talent, set up in 2012, which signed gaming star KSI, and Gleam Futures, which snapped up YouTuber Zoe Sugg.

Timothy Armoo founded Fanbytes in 2017 with fellow computer scientists he met at university.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Timothy Armoo of Fanbytes explains how his success is grounded in a love of maths

The company is busy signing up Snapchat and TikTok users, with a focus on ""Gen Z"" and the 18-21 market. It uses in-house algorithms to predict whose followings are about to take off.

Its software also measures who can persuade their followers to click on links - this is known as ""conversion ability"".

After that, some old-fashioned human decision making comes into play.

""We want people who can deliver what we call 'advertainment'"", explains Armoo. This is a seamless mixture of fun and paid-for content, while maintaining what he describes as a ""boy- or girl-next-door quality"".

Armoo has hooked influencers up with brands like Deliveroo, but also the government, who wanted his help to spread the word about the national minimum wage to a BAME audience.

Image copyright other Image caption Shauni Kibby - known on Tiktok as @Itzshauni

Shauni gets recognised by young teenagers in the street all the time thanks to her work on TikTok, where she has 3.2 million followers.

She joined the app's predecessor, Musical.ly in 2016. Within five days her videos were getting 10,000 likes and she immediately saw the potential, she says.

You can see why her videos appeal to a young audience. Many are like playground games and include fun pranks, tricks to impress friends, dances, or skits about love and relationships.

TikTok now provides her with enough money to live on, plus the ability to indulge her habit of clothes shopping - but less than you might think, given the size of her fanbase.

Sara McCorquodale, who runs an influencer intelligence platform called CORQ which tracks TikTok trends, agrees the platform is a tricky financial proposition.

While she predicts that brands will be spending more money on it this year, the model for rewarding influencers will have to be different to YouTube or Instagram, because ""short-term trends dominate what is popular as much as individual personalities"".

""It's like the internet before Facebook, it's fast-moving and unpredictable.""

Image copyright other Image caption TikTok stars Shanae and Renae are launching a lip gloss product

TikTok is busy moving into the mainstream with an advertising campaign, and expanding its community management operation in London. It will have to manage its influencers' money-making activities more carefully as it gets more attention.

""If you make sponsored content you have to do it explicitly and if the brand or influencer doesn't, they can get sanctioned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA),"" says Ms McCorquodale. ""Even if you are wearing a piece of clothing that is a gift, that has to be made clear.""

Not all influencers on TikTok are following these rules at the moment, and Instagram influencers have recently been banned for being irresponsible and for not being up front about product promotion.

Image caption Sara McCorquodale runs a social media influencer intelligence agency

TikTok says that ""every video posted as an advertisement is reviewed by us to ensure it is compliant with the ASA guidelines"".

It also says it regularly shares the ASA guidelines with creators, and that if an influencer indicates a video is sponsored, it will automatically be posted with ""#ad"" displayed.

TikTok has fallen foul of influencer behaviour before. Last year it was forced to apologise for the way some stars exploited young fans for financial gain through ""digital gifts"", with influencers themselves calling for more guidance from the app.

TikTok's growing prominence has also seen it face closer scrutiny over issues that affect all social media platforms like user privacy and personal safety.

It was fined in the United States for holding data on children under 13 and more recently faced criticism for the meme known as the skull-breaker challenge.

Charities have also called for it to do more to prevent the grooming of young children.

Jake plans to complete his degree and then pursue a full-time career as a social media influencer, focusing on TikTok.

""I want this to be an occupation for me,"" he says. Meanwhile, he is simply enjoying the interesting opportunities it brings.

The student's next engagement is a party to celebrate the launch of a new shoe, which he will of course be TikToking about.

When one of Louise Halford's staff members returned from a ski trip with flu-like symptoms, she advised him to work from home rather than risk bringing the coronavirus into the office.

Ms Halford also decided to work from home after feeling some possible symptoms as well.

""We work with someone who has a compromised immune system, so I don't want to take any chances,"" says Ms Halford, co-founder of Manchester-based Evolve Family Law.

Around the world, millions of other people have also been told to stay at home in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19.

That includes Apple where the chief executive Tim Cook told staff, ""feel free to work remotely if your job allows"".

Amazon and Google have similar policies in place.

""Employers are definitely taking this seriously,"" says Hannah Ford, a partner and employment law expert at law firm Stevens & Bolton.

""We are advising lots of clients on crisis management plans.""

Fortunately, there are now a huge variety of tools and services available to help employees perform their roles effectively from home.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Demand for videoconferencing services around the world is rising

Keeping in touch

Communicating with colleagues is crucial, which is why remote meeting services are in high demand.

In China, up to 22 times as many people are using Cisco's Webex videoconferencing service since the coronavirus appeared.

Like several of its competitors, it has upgraded its free service in response to the surge in demand.

Anyone signing up to its 90-day free plan can therefore benefit from unlimited usage, while the maximum number of participants is now 100, up from 50.

Rival Zoom also has a free video-conferencing plan. Its free tier allows unlimited one-to-one meetings, as well as group sessions lasting up to 40 minutes and involving 100 participants.

More Technology of Business

Staying secure

Those new to working from home present a juicy target for hackers, who will no doubt sense an opportunity to steal sensitive information, or commit online fraud.

To keep information secure most companies will use a virtual private network (VPN) to create an encrypted connection from the user's computer to their company IT system.

However, even businesses with a quality VPN may need to buy more user licences or improve the server capacity for everyone to use it at once.

""Companies are increasingly stress-testing their servers to ensure they will cope with everyone working remotely,"" Ms Ford says.

Another option would be to control your work computer from home using remote desktop software.

You might even want to use both bits of tech, which would provide a secure way to access your work computer.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Check your internet connection before working from home

If you are going to work from home, you might want to check that your internet connection is reliable.

Self-employed accountant Elizabeth Stanley's advice for anyone who may have to self-isolate is therefore to ""get your internet connection and security sorted now"".

""It's worth checking your home broadband provider allows you to connect to a VPN as this varies between providers, packages, and areas,"" says Ms Stanley, who is based in Newport, South Wales.

If not, you may need to upgrade, or invest in a mobile hotspot or router.

Anyone who collaborates with colleagues in different locations has probably used documents shared over the internet.

Slack, for example, is a secure instant messaging platform that offers file sharing and video calls and wants ""to replace email"".

It has around ten million users, including Sam O'Connor, co-founder of London-based banking app Coconut.

""Slack is a really good way of keeping in touch with everyone when you are working remotely,"" he says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Slack hopes to replace email with its collaborative work software

Slack's advice for users forced into quarantine includes setting up an Announcements channel that is read-only for most people but that administrators and managers can use to post important information.

It also recommends using the app's custom statuses to let colleagues know when you are on a call or away from your desk, and sketching out ideas on paper before taking a photo with your phone - rather than spending time and energy creating a slide.

But Slack is just one of many such apps.

Other options include Microsoft's Teams platform.

Part of Office 365, Teams' free version supports up to 300 participants and offers guest access, one-on-one, and group video and audio calls, as well as file and screen sharing, and online document collaboration.

And for businesses requiring more services, Microsoft too has responded to the current epidemic by offering a free six-month trial of the paid version, including full meetings, collaboration and workflow capabilities.

Asana is a similar service, with 70,000 paying customers at the end of 2019.

"['Will Smale', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']",The tech boss who lost more than a billion,"Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption Andrew Rickman today runs Rockley Photonics, which specialises in designing and producing next-generation, optical computer chips

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to UK technology pioneer Andrew Rickman.

How would you feel if you lost more than £1.4bn ($1.81bn) almost overnight?

That was the situation faced by Andrew Rickman back at the end of 2000, when the dotcom bubble spectacularly burst, sending shares in his company Bookham Technology plummeting.

""It was like a nuclear winter,"" he says looking back.

Andrew had set up Bookham in 1988 in the kitchen of his home in Wiltshire, when he was 28. It grew to become one of the world's leading providers of optical components for the telecommunication and computer industries. In very simple terms, its technology allowed data to be transferred very quickly using lasers and glass fibres.

By the late 1990s its sales were booming as more and more homes and businesses were being connected to the internet, and mobile phone networks were being rolled out.

Image copyright Andrew Rickman Image caption Andrew says his previous wealth was widely reported in UK newspapers

The good times were, well, so good, that after Bookham floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in April 2000, within two months it had joined the FTSE 100 index. This is the list of the 100 firms on the exchange with the largest market capitalisation - the combined value of all their shares.

Such was the surge of Bookham's share price that Andrew, who owned the largest stake in the business, became the UK's first technology billionaire. This sent the UK's tabloid newspapers into a frenzy, and the softly spoken, modest 40-year-old was suddenly a reluctant celebrity.

Journalists excitedly told their readers that he was richer than Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Paul McCartney combined. Looking back, he says he was ""embarrassed"" by all the coverage.

At the peak of Bookham's share price in the summer of 2000, Andrew was worth more than £1.5bn. Then the dotcom bubble burst, and before the end of the year Bookham's share price - and Andrew's wealth - had collapsed.

This thrust him back into the papers, which now gleefully reported his downfall.

Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption He predicts that his latest company - Rockley Photonics - could see billions of pounds in annual sales

""I didn't think particularly much about all the press coverage,"" says Andrew, now 59. ""The money wasn't an issue, because it was only on paper. Being the first dotcom billionaire wasn't a reality to me.

""The thing that was difficult to deal with, as a human being, was the massive change of circumstances for the company and our technology. It was an emotionally difficult thing to handle for many different reasons.""

The big problem for Bookham was that its cutting-edge optical equipment was expensive. And after the dotcom bubble burst, its customers - the firms building all the new networks - switched to using cheaper, simpler technology instead.

But before you feel sorry for Andrew, he still had some £50m in his bank account, and he was able to slowly build Bookham back up again. This involved delisting from the LSE, and moving the company to Silicon Valley to get around the then high price of sterling, and be closer to key customers.

Andrew eventually left the business in 2004, to start a new career as a technology investor. Then in 2013 he started his latest business - Rockley Photonics.

Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption Andrew now employs a team which keeps a close eye on economic and industry trends

Based in Oxford, with a 150-strong workforce, it designs a product called silicon photonic chips. These are like standard microchips, but with one key difference - they beam light around the chip instead of sending an electronic current.

Although the photonic chip industry is still in its infancy, the advantage is said to be that they can process a lot more data, more quickly. Photonic chips are now increasingly being used in everything from data centres to sensor systems on autonomous cars, and in the latest mobile phones.

Andrew says that Rockley now has an annual turnover in the ""tens of millions"", but with the potential of increasing this to billions.

Veteran electronics journalist Peter Clarke says that Andrew ""is one of a group of UK engineering visionaries that also carry the entrepreneurial gene"".

""Rickman is smart in an intense, academic way, and a good advert for the UK higher education system."" (He was educated at Imperial College in London, and the University of Surrey.)

Looking back on the dotcom bust, does Andrew think he should have predicted it?

""Hindsight is a great thing,"" he says. ""I don't think many people were prepared for that sort of boom and bust, they never seem to be.

""The span of time between boom and busts tends to be sufficient for the collective knowledge to have gone into retirement. But we were one of very, very, very few firms in our area that survived.

""One thing I did learn at that time was to have an eye to a more analytical view of the world around us. So from that point on I've always had what I would describe as an analysis team... They sit there and they basically analyse the environment the whole time, so, if you like, they become a sensitive seismic monitor.

"['Lucy Proctor', 'Bbc Stories']",'My search for the boy in a child abuse video',"One day, just after I had dropped my son off at school, I was sent a horrific video on WhatsApp. It made me question how images and videos of child sex abuse come to be made, and how they can be openly circulated on social media. And I wanted one answer above all - what happened to the boy in the video?

It may sound strange, but the woman who sent me the video was a fellow mum at the school gates. A group of us had set up a WhatsApp group to discuss term dates, uniforms, illnesses.

Then one morning, out of the blue, one of these mums sent a video to the group, with two crying-face emojis underneath it.

It was just a black box, no thumbnail, and we all pressed play without thinking. Maybe it would be a meme or a news story. Maybe one of the ""stranger danger"" videos some of the mums had started to share.

The video starts with a shot of a man and a baby, about 18 months old, sitting on a sofa. The baby smiles at the man.

I can't describe the rest.

If I tell you what I saw in the 10 seconds it took to grasp what was happening, and press stop, you'll have the image in your head too. And you don't want it. It's a video of child sex abuse. It's nine minutes long.

I screamed, and threw my phone across the room. It was pinging with messages from distraught members of the group.

I took my phone to the police station. I told them what had happened. I told them I believed the woman had sent it to us as a warning, and that I hoped they would investigate where the video came from. Was it new, or one they'd already come across? Was this little boy still in danger? Could this evidence help save him, or catch the abuser?

The police had my phone for two weeks. I found out the next day that they arrested the woman who sent it and visited other members of the group. And then I didn't hear anything else about it.

But one question stayed with me. What happened to the boy in the video? And so, a few months later, once I could read my own kids a bedtime story without thinking of him and life had got back to normal, I began to look for answers.

I started by trying to speak to the police officer investigating the video on my phone. But every time I called Wembley CID to speak to him, he'd just gone out.

He didn't want anything to do with me.

I checked with Alan Collins, a lawyer who specialises in child sex abuse, to see if any of the things I might normally do to track down people would work. Could I, for example, send former police officers a copy of the video to see if they recognised it?

""You could be looking at a prison sentence of 10 years,"" he told me. Same goes for taking a still and sending that. Just possessing an image like this on my phone could land me in jail.

So I called a friend of a friend who used to work for the police. He told me Wembley CID would have sent my phone off to one of the digital forensics labs spread across the city. The labs list all the illegal content, and when it's child sex abuse they grade it: Category A for the most serious, Cat B, Cat C. This WhatsApp video was Cat A.

Next, the file goes to victim identification and my case was passed to the Metropolitan Police's Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Command. An officer there, Det Sgt Lindsay Dick, agreed to talk to me, but he didn't want to say much about the techniques used in case it helped offenders work out how to evade capture.

An estimated 100,000 men in the UK regularly view child sex abuse

Police arrest between 400 and 450 people a month, men mostly, for viewing or downloading these files

WhatsApp takes down 250,000 accounts every month suspected of spreading child sex abuse material, based on the names of groups and profile pictures

He did tell me about one case, where an officer had got hold of a phone that had images of a boy being abused on it, along with images of the same boy not being abused. In one, he's standing at a bus stop in school uniform. An officer recognised the bus stop as a Mersey Transport sign, and put a call in to the Merseyside team. They recognised the school uniform. The boy was identified, his parents arrested, and social services took over. Victim-identification police all over the world rely on little clues like this.

Lindsay Dick wouldn't discuss the details of what I'd been sent, even though he had investigated the case. Then, when I asked him about a suggestion from an editor to take a still from the video of the perpetrator's face, to help identify him, I started to feel some heat.

""Do you still have a copy of that video?"" he asked me, sternly. ""No,"" I replied. But it was still sitting somewhere on WhatsApp's server, and because I was still a member of the group, it was still showing on my phone. Even though I'd done nothing wrong, I realised how seriously the police took this kind of thing.

This hit home late last year when a senior Metropolitan Police officer, Supt Novlett Robyn Williams, was given 200 community hours' unpaid work and threatened with losing her job for failing to report a video of child sex abuse her sister had sent her on WhatsApp. (She is now appealing against the conviction.)

The Metropolitan Police refused to help me any further in my search for the boy in the video. At one point they even told officers in another part of the country, incorrectly, that I'd been cautioned for sharing the video.

I found out later from the woman who sent the video to me that she had been given three years on the sex offenders register. But the investigating officers at Wembley CID took the case no further - they didn't arrest the friend who had sent it to her, and they didn't even try to find out who had sent it to her friend. Further up that chain of people sharing the video must be some dangerous people, perhaps an abuser. But nothing was done to follow the trail.

The Metropolitan Police says: ""The scale of child abuse and sexual exploitation offending online has grown in recent years. This increased demand on police, coupled with the need to keep up with advancement of technology and adapt our methods to detect and identify offenders, means it is a challenging area for the Met and police forces nationally. However, we remain committed to bringing those who commit child abuse offences online to justice, and safeguarding victims and young people at risk.

""We encourage anyone concerned about a child at risk of abuse or a possible victim, to contact police immediately. Anyone who receives an unsolicited message which depicts child abuse should report it to police immediately so action can be taken. Images of this nature should not be shared under any circumstances.""

I needed someone who wasn't involved with the case to give me some more clues about where this file I'd been sent might have come from. So I started searching, and I came across news articles about a team in Queensland, Australia with a reputation for infiltrating child abuse video-sharing sites.

Their head of victim identification, former Greater Manchester Police detective Paul Griffiths, told me the file I'd been sent had probably started life on one of these sites.

""What tends to happen is that when a file gets produced like that, it generally stays under cover, under wraps, circulating amongst a fairly small, tight network. Very often people who would know that they need to keep it safe and not distribute it widely,"" he said.

These networks of paedophiles use the dark web, a part of the internet that isn't indexed readily by search engines such as Google. They access sites through a connection called TOR, or the onion router. They use a fake IP address, connected to several other servers dotted around the globe, which makes their location untraceable.

Members of these dark web sites are like sick stamp collectors - they post thumbnails of what they have on dedicated online forums, and look to complete series, usually of a particular child.

Some of them are ""producers"" - they abuse the children, or film them being abused.

A couple of years ago Paul Griffiths' team was watching one site called Child's Play. They had intelligence that two of the site's leaders were meeting up in the US. Officers intercepted them, arrested them, and got their passwords.

Now they could see everything - each and every video - and they could get to work finding children and perpetrators. They made hundreds of arrests worldwide, and 200 children have been saved so far.

""It's Sherlock Holmes stuff, it's following little clues and seeing what you can piece together to try and find a needle in a haystack,"" says Griffiths.

The big worry now is live-streaming, where adults can pay to watch children being abused in real time. It's even harder to detect, because no file containing clues circulates, and the platforms are all encrypted. Just as the police and technology get better at finding victims in stills or videos, another threat emerges.

""There's a famous story and it often gets told in relation to this area of crime, in relation to the young girl walking on the beach and there's starfish all over the beach and she's picking the starfish up and putting them back into the sea and a guy says to her, 'Little girl, what are you doing? You're never gonna be able to save all of these starfish.' And she says, 'No, but I'll save that one.' And that's really what we're doing,"" says Griffiths.

""You know, we're saving the ones we can save. And if some magical solution appears somewhere in the future that's going to save all of them, that's going to stop this happening, then that'll be wonderful. But in the meantime, we can't just sit back and ignore what we know is happening.""

Paul Griffiths is part of a small network of people who travel the globe for meetings and conferences on what to do about the huge numbers of videos and images circulating online.

He told me to contact Maggie Brennan, a lecturer in clinical forensic psychology at the University of Plymouth, who has been studying child-sex-abuse material for years. Between 2016 and 2018 she combed through the child-abuse images in a database run by Interpol, to build up a profile of victims.

She found a chilling pattern that suggested the age of the boy in the video I saw is not that unusual.

""Concerningly, there is a substantive, small, but important proportion of those images that do depict infants and toddlers. And we found a significant result in terms of the association between very extreme forms of sexual violence and very young children.""

Like the boy in the video I was sent, most children on the database are white - most likely a reflection of the fact that the police forces contributing to it are from majority-white countries.

There's constant pressure, Brennan says, to quantify the numbers of images or videos that are in existence, and the numbers of victims who are being sexually exploited. But it's impossible. Databases only hold the images that have been found, through police raids or reports. Who knows how many are circulating out there?

Paul Griffiths says it only takes one person to bring a video out of the depths of the dark web and unleash it on the general population.

""Sooner or later it comes into the possession of someone who either doesn't know how to keep it safe and hidden, or doesn't really care. And they spread it wider. It can take a few hours, and it's all over the internet.""

I spoke to one offender who served seven months in prison for viewing child abuse images. He had been offered the files on Skype during an adult online sexual meet-up. He'd opened the first file, seen it was of a child - and carried on opening all 20. Then he tried to share them with someone else. Eventually, the man who sent him the files sent them to someone who told the police. But it's a telling example of how easily files like the one I was sent spread, from the depths of the dark web, on to platforms like Skype, and then to people's phones.

Despite the lack of action taken on my case, the UK policing response to child sex abuse images is one of the most robust in the world.

The Child Abuse Image Database (CAID) has seen huge investment over the last five years. When detectives receive the phone or laptop of a suspect, they can run images on it through state-of-the-art software that checks whether images are new, or already known to police. All police forces are linked up, and the database talks to others around the world.

In the 1990s the Home Office undertook a study of the proliferation of indecent imagery of children. There were less than 10,000 images in circulation then. Now there are almost 14 million images on the UK database.

The levels of depravity in videos and images are getting worse, Chief Constable Simon Bailey tells me. He's been the National Police Chief Council's lead for child protection and abuse investigations for the last five years.

I am expecting a forbidding character when I go to interview him at his Norfolk HQ. What I find is a man at the end of his tether.

""It just keeps growing, and growing, and growing,"" he says. ""And there is an element of, 'These figures are just so huge that just can't be right.' Well trust me, it is right. And if I have one really significant regret around my leadership and our response to this it's that we have struggled to land with the public the true scale of what we are dealing with, the horrors of what we are dealing with. Most people, I would like to think, would be mortified that this type of abuse is taking place.""

Last year, Simon Bailey called for a boycott of tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, until they invest in technology to filter and block these images and videos. The public, including myself, took little notice.

Last year, the robots Facebook deploys to sift through its Messenger service reported 12 million posts containing images of child abuse to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which runs the US database.

So child protection campaigners are horrified at Facebook's decision to start encrypting Messenger over the coming months, because it will mean the platform effectively goes ""dark"" and abusers will be able to share material with impunity.

It will become more like WhatsApp, where end-to-end encryption means no-one except the sender and receiver knows anything about what's in a message.

WhatsApp's encryption works because your phone and the phone of the person you're messaging generate the encryption codes and keys. When the message leaves your phone, it does travel through WhatsApp's servers - but they don't have the keys to decrypt it. The only way robots or artificial intelligence could scan the message would be if it was encrypted after it left your phone. But that would give prying regimes, law enforcement or the tech firms themselves a window into our messages. WhatsApp thinks it would lose customers as a result.

The solution is to do the scanning on our phones.

One way this could be done would be for everyone to download software with a list of all the unique codes of all the known child abuse images and videos. But this would still raise privacy concerns. The tech firms could fiddle with the list of codes to include non-child-abuse images - censorship in other words.

So it would be better if phones could run an algorithm to generate the codes themselves, completely independently from any government or tech company. This is the tricky bit though. No one's invented that algorithm yet.

One expert I spoke to put it like this: ""I wouldn't call it impossible, I'd call it unknown how to do it today."" It would take huge amounts of research and development - but it could probably be done.

The failure by Big Tech to invest in this angers Simon Bailey.

""They hold the key to so much of this. Their duty of care I think to children, they have completely absolved themselves of that.

""The reaction is always, 'Well we're doing our best.' No you're not. You need to do more. You're making billions of pounds in profit. Invest.""

There are high hopes for the UK government's Online Harms White Paper published in April 2019 - a radical proposal for legislation that would see tech firms held responsible for the harm they do. It proposes a new regulator and campaigners hope the resulting bill will include mandatory reporting of any child sex abuse. The results of a public consultation are due soon.

At the moment, the tech firms choose what to tell us. No-one knows, for example, how much Facebook or WhatsApp spend on child protection. Facebook says it has the best artificial intelligence on the market trying to block and filter messages. But the company won't reveal how it works, or how much it costs.

John Carr, who advises governments on child safety online, says this lack of transparency has to end.

""I work with people in these companies all the time, they agree with me on most stuff, they care passionately about protecting children but they don't make the decisions. It's their bosses, typically in California, that decide what happens. People high up in those companies need to feel the heat, they need to feel that their feet are being brought to the fire.""

Of course, I ask to speak to WhatsApp. They say no.

One bright summer day, I finally get a breakthrough in my search for the boy in the video. Simon Bailey's assistant puts me in touch with a senior police officer who opens some doors, and I get a call.

I'm told the boy is alive. He's one of the lucky minority who have been identified and rescued.

The video I was sent is an old one, from America. There are already three versions of it on the UK's CAID database - mine makes it four. Police can't tell me where he is, or what his name is. But they do tell me his abuser is serving a long jail term. It's the news I was hoping for.

And I'm happy to leave it at that. There's one word that has stuck in mind over the months that I've tried to find out more about this case - ""revictimisation"". Each time anybody watches or shares a video of a child being abused, that child is revictimised. And as I get closer to finding the boy, I realise I could end up making a phone call to tell him, out of the blue, that I've seen the video of him. He'd be reminded of the horror. He'd be humiliated. I should just leave him in peace.

But I've learned about a campaign group in the US made up of victims - people filmed by abusers - who want to be found, and heard.

James Marsh, a lawyer who has been representing and campaigning for victims of child sex abuse for 14 years, recently spearheaded a change to the law in America that gives victims a right to a minimum of $3,000 compensation from everyone convicted of viewing or sharing a video of their abuse.

It's called the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018, after the three young victims who backed it by writing impact statements for the courts.

""It's only been really very recently that victims have become more empowered to reclaim that space, really trying to assert that this is not a victimless crime, that these are not harmless pictures, and that they have voices that deserve to be heard,"" he tells me.

Voluntary principles

A set of ""voluntary principles"" for the tech industry, designed to counter online child sexual exploitation and abuse was published this week by the governments of the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, after consultations with six leading tech companies.

An accompanying letter acknowledged the industry's efforts, but said there was ""much more to be done to strengthen existing efforts"". It added that the initiative was intended to ""drive collective action"".

The principles include preventing dissemination of child sex abuse material, targeting online grooming, preventing search results from surfacing child sexual abuse, and sharing data about the evolving threat.

Recently a seasoned journalist called him for details about what happened to one of his clients. She was expecting to hear that the abuse involved naked photos. When he told her of the reality of the content of these films - the rape of a small child - she was horrified, and didn't publish the details.

""I think as a journalist you're turning off your readership by including these graphic descriptions. And yet, how else can you accurately report what's happening to bring about meaningful change?""

He says his clients, as they get older, have become frustrated by this squeamishness. ""This is our lived experience,"" they say. ""Face up to it.""

I ask him if he thinks the young man, Andy, from the Amy and Vicky and Andy Act, would be up for talking to me. He agrees to connect us on Facebook Messenger.

And with that, I had found a boy in a video. One who had suffered the same terrible fate as the boy in the video I was sent.

Whatever I might have wanted to ask that boy, I could ask Andy. Did he have somewhere safe to sleep at night? Had he managed to stay safe?

Andy has a warm voice. He's eager to talk, candid and hugely likeable. It's strange, but our conversation is not a miserable one.

He tells me he is in his early 20s. He's been out of jail for six months, which is the longest he's managed since he was a child. Fighting mainly, and robbery. When he was younger he was into drugs - meth, heroin and weed. He's doing well at staying off them now. And he has two children, who he adores.

But he lives in a kind of prison.

""I'm kind of a boring person. I don't really go out much, I stay at home, I kind of live just with my kids, and that's about it.""

Andy lives in constant fear that someone might recognise him from one of the videos his abuser made of him, as the abuse continued until he was 13. If someone so much as looks at him in the street, he worries.

His story starts with his parents' divorce. His mother wanted a male figure in his life, and so when Andy was around seven years old she sent him to a youth programme. The ""mentor"" allocated by the organisation groomed Andy and his family for a few months and took Andy on trips to Las Vegas.

Andy didn't tell anyone when the sexual abuse started, because he didn't want to upset his mother.

""I didn't know how my mom would act about it. I didn't want her to be embarrassed because something had happened to me. I didn't know if it was normal. That's kind of how he made it seem.""

How to get help

If you've been affected by the issues touched on in this story, you can find sources of support on the BBC Action Line

The Lucy Faithfull Foundation works to prevent and tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation

When Andy grew old enough he confronted his abuser, who soon afterwards went on the run to Mexico. Then, one day, the FBI turned up at Andy's high school and knocked on his classroom door. The abuser had got sloppy - he'd sent a video to someone he didn't know, who'd reported him.

""And then they tell me that there's hundreds of thousands of videos and pictures of me out on the web.""

Until that moment, Andy had no idea his abuse had been shared at all, let alone with thousands of people. But despite this shocking news, and the difficulty of telling his mother the truth, Andy agreed to help the FBI lure his abuser back across the border.

""We coaxed him back with a birthday party of mine.

""It was a whole three months, all the way up until my birthday. I talked with him on the phone, like nothing was wrong. He sent me a few packages.""

The FBI officers set up the sting. They showed Andy the route they thought his abuser would take and the location of the planned arrest.

""It was really cool. They caught him a couple blocks from my grandmother's house, pulled him over and arrested him.""

It was one of the best moments of Andy's life.

Like other identified victims in the US, Andy gets a letter every time someone is convicted of viewing or sharing a video of him. He has thousands of them.

He's doing his best to rebuild his life. When he can afford therapy, things are better. His lawyers are working on some big cases, which should bring him more compensation. But it's tough.

""Work is really hard for me. And it's not because I'm lazy or anything. It's mainly the mentality of not being able to trust somebody. I can't let this person in. So I'm really anti-social.""

Andy, like all victims, was incredibly unlucky to fall into the hands of an abuser. Had he not, he thinks he would by now have been the CEO of his father's business.

He is finding purpose and solace in his involvement with Amy, Vicky and Andy's law. The three young campaigners hope to meet up in person soon. In the future, Andy wants to give up his anonymity and go into schools to teach children how to stay safe, and how to tell someone if they are not. He feels an obligation to do it he says.

""You know, I want people to know my story.""

I will never get to talk to the other boy in the video. I hope he's OK. I hope he can rebuild his life - however slowly and imperfectly - like Andy.

I've been able to give you a happy ending. Both Andy and the little boy in the video I was sent have been identified and their abusers are in prison. But this is wildly misleading.

Most of the boys and girls in videos won't be rescued. And without radical reform of the way we manage technology and privacy, videos like the one I saw will keep circulating, and new children will be abused to feed the demand.

"['Chris Baraniuk', 'Technology Of Business Reporter']",Electric cars are coming: but where will you recharge?,"Image copyright Tiffany Snowden Image caption The Snowdens can't always charge their car outside their house

They've got the only electric car in the village. Tiffany Snowden and her husband bought their second-hand Nissan Leaf a few weeks ago and love it. It's smooth to drive and, she says, ""It's got quite a lot of power to it"". But there's a problem. It's a pain to charge up.

That's because, in the North Yorkshire hamlet where they live, it's a race home every night to get a parking space outside their house. If they succeed, they can plug the car in to mains electricity overnight. If they fail, the options are limited.

""The closest charging point to us is about 10 miles away,"" says Mrs Snowden.

This is a dilemma that could face an increasing number of drivers. The government says that in just 15 years the only new cars on the market will be fully electric vehicles (EVs) or hydrogen-powered alternatives.

While the number of charging points around the UK has increased by about 50% in the last 12 months, according to statistics from EV charging site Zap-Map.com, there are noticeable gaps in provision around the country.

A recent report from Capital Economics suggested that fleshing out the UK's charging network will cost £45.9bn between now and 2050. There are even fears that the electricity grid won't be able to cope as thousands more EVs get plugged in by their new owners.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of charging points has risen by 50% over last 12 months

Is the UK ready for the electric vehicle revolution, then, or is the whole movement doomed to stall?

The Snowdens are hoping that their local charging problem will have a local solution. The government has allocated £5 million in funding for councils to spend on residential charging points.

However, when Mrs Snowden asked her council about this, a representative told her there was little space in the village for charging bays. Plus, they added that the expense of upgrading infrastructure for such facilities was significant. Improving cabling and substations alone could cost ""upwards of £75,000"", they said.

The representative advised Mrs Snowden to ask whether the local pub could install a charging point instead - because it has parking space available and, potentially, spare electricity.

In the meantime, the Snowdens intend to upgrade their home charging point and will have to carefully plan where they charge up and how they use the roughly 80 miles of range they get with their 2014 Nissan Leaf.

""I think we've kind of gone about it perhaps a bit backwards in getting the car first,"" she jokes. ""We kind of jumped a bit into it but I think we just have to face it now, really.""

More Technology of Business

For anyone else wondering where they might charge up a new EV, there are an increasing options, says Ben Lane, co-founder at Zap-Map.com.

""At current rates, we're essentially doubling the number of charge points in the UK over a two year period,"" he says. Around 10,000 individual charging connectors were installed in the last 12 months in the UK. However, Dr Lane adds that there are places where gaps in the network are apparent.

""Wales is the country in the United Kingdom that probably needs to do the biggest catch-up,"" he says. And while England has by far the most chargers, there are places where coverage is ""fragmented"".

Certainly, some EV users have not faced the same challenges as the Snowdens in North Yorkshire.

Richard Jackson and his wife bought their first EV, a BMW i3, as an experiment back in 2016.

""We ended up using the BMW for everything,"" he says. ""It very quickly became our main family car.""

Image copyright Virtronix Image caption The Jacksons and their electric cars

Mr Jackson, who used to work in the petrol sector, commutes into London from his home near Hatfield and says that one of his main motivations for buying an electric car was to play a part in reducing ambient pollution in the capital.

""I really could tell, 'Wow, the air is not as good as it is out in the sticks'. I wanted to see… could I make a difference?"" he explains.

He's since bought a second electric car, an MG ZS EV, and hasn't looked back. Planning when and where to charge on journeys is important, Mr Jackson says, but he's taken his car to France on family holidays without problems. Since he began driving an electric vehicle, he has come close to running out of electricity on only one occasion, he says.

However, he does add that while he saves money on petrol, charging the car when out and about does incur other costs: ""My goodness me, you buy a lot of coffees when you go into charge points.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption BP owns the Chargemaster network of charging stations

Most of the charging bays being installed at the moment are being paid for by private businesses - including electricity companies, car makers and firms, like BP for instance, that also run petrol stations. Chargers might be located at service stations or hotels, leisure centres and shopping complexes, for example.

In some cases, these facilities are free to use but most charge a fee or a monthly subscription. There are also important differences to watch out for - charging times will vary widely depending on whether you plug in to a slow, fast or rapid charger.

More than £1.5bn will need to be spent on public charging infrastructure by 2030, according to accountancy firm Deloitte. There are huge costs in terms of supplying cabling and substations as well as the charging points themselves, say Deloitte's Jamie Hamilton and Michael Woodward.

Dr Lane at Zap-Map.com estimates that the UK's chargers will need to be used on average around five times as often as they are today before the system is financially sustainable. Investing in the network now, though, is essential.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many electric cars, including Audi's e-tron promise more than 200 miles between charges

As Mr Hamilton says, ""Lack of charging infrastructure is the number one barrier to people in terms of buying EVs at the moment."" That's become the top concern, having overtaken price and range, according to Deloitte's market research. Some new cars on sale today, including the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Audi e-tron, have more than 200 miles in range.

Even if the number of charging points around the UK does boom, some question whether the electricity grid will be able to cope with thousands of new vehicles thirsty for power.

A National Grid spokeswoman told the BBC that the anticipated increase of in electricity demand of 10% that is expected from EVs is ""entirely manageable"" because peak demand has fallen by 16% in the UK since 2002, due to efficiency gains. However, she adds that the system will still need to ensure everyone isn't plugging in their electric car at once.

This means connecting up charging points to a computer system that determines when they can be used. Currently, private individuals' car-charging habits are difficult to monitor and control.

The government has plans to bring in a new law that would ensure every new home built in the UK has an EV charging point. Some housing developments are already ploughing ahead with this idea.

Pedro Pacheco at market analysts Gartner praises this approach and says that, ultimately, drivers will have to be able to easily charge their cars at home or at work - with minimal change to their daily routines.

""In the end, this is absolutely essential for the acceptance of EVs,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51678830,BBC,Tech,True
,Coronavirus: More universities halt teaching and exams,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Face-to-face lectures are being suspended at many universities

Salford, Bristol, Edinburgh, Nottingham and Southampton universities are among the latest to rearrange teaching and exams to limit the spread of Covid-19.

Measures include ending term early, online teaching and cancelling exams.

The moves came as six Oxford students were diagnosed with the virus, while St Andrew's and Bristol universities have each reported a case.

""I recognise many of you are understandably anxious,"" Nottingham's vice-chancellor told students.

Prof Shearer West said in a letter, which she asked students to share with friends and family: ""I am writing to let you know what measures we are taking immediately to reassure you, protect your health and ensure that your learning can continue.""

Nottingham will put all teaching online from 23 March and is cancelling all trips overseas and residential trips within the UK.

However, the letter stresses the university - including its libraries - will remain open.

Salford University has announced all teaching - except for final-year students - will be suspended from Monday, but the campus and student accommodation will remain open.

""This will give us time and space to plan for what may be necessary,"" said a spokesperson.

Edinburgh is also transferring teaching online. Exams are cancelled for first- and second-year students, with those in their third year and beyond taking them online.

Again, the university stressed it was still open, with libraries, counselling, research and study spaces operating as usual.

""Students should be assured that they will achieve their qualifications on time and an Edinburgh degree will still hold the same value,"" said a spokesperson.

The University of West of Scotland has asked students not to attend its campuses from Monday, although it, too, says it will remain open.

It intends to move to remote learning ""to reduce the number of individuals on campus at any one time"".

Early holidays

Meanwhile, the University of Southampton has decided to bring its spring holiday forward by a week so that term now ends on 13 March.

""We will keep any impact to the absolute minimum and ensure all students can successfully complete their term's learning,"" it said in a statement.

Summer term is scheduled to start as normal next month.

Image caption Even if teaching and exams are off, libraries will remain open, say universities

In a similar move, the University of Bristol has announced it will end face-to-face teaching earlier this term, on 18 March. Online teaching will begin after the holidays and all overseas fieldtrips are cancelled.

Bristol vice-chancellor Hugh Brady, said he believed the measures were ""balanced and proportionate"".

""This is indeed a very worrying time for us all - professionally and personally - but I am confident that we can harness our collective ingenuity, resolve and passion for our institution to navigate the choppy waters ahead,"" he said.

'Business as usual'

Across the city, University of West of England took a different approach, tweeting: ""It is currently business as usual here but please rest assured we're monitoring the situation very closely and are able to act quickly if it changes to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our students, staff and visitors.""

A number of universities had previously announced moves to online teaching, including Durham, Manchester Metropolitan, the London School of Economics and Loughborough, where one student has tested positive for the virus.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51880355,BBC,Education,True
,Coronavirus: Government insists schools should stay open,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption There are real worries over the impact the virus will have on learning

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said keeping schools open in England is the ""best course of action"", despite fears about the coronavirus.

It comes as blanket school closures are being announced in European nations such as Spain, France and Ireland.

He told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that sending all pupils home would put a big strain on key workers who would also have to stay at home.

School leaders agreed keeping schools open was the right decision.

Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which is meeting for its annual conference, said head teachers would authorise absence if parents took the decision to keep their children off lessons.

'Exams worry'

He anticipated absences would be small in scale and similar to ""snow days"".

The government has said individual schools may be advised to shut by Public Health England if necessary.

Mr Barton said there was pressure from parents for more information and guidance about what might happen to national exams.

The exam season starts in early May, when the virus outbreak is expected to reach its peak, but exam regulators are urging schools to prepare for public exams as normal.

GCSE exams start in the second week of May and run until mid-June.

Mr Barton said many head teachers were facing questions about the exam season, and there was an urgent need for reassurance.

""Parents and pupils are worried about being the victim of something out of their control and are asking, 'Will I get into college or university?'""

Mr Williamson said: ""We're doing everything we can to make sure it's fair for students, we're having regular discussions with Ofqual.""

The government warned on Thursday that within weeks, whole households would be asked to self-isolate if one person showed symptoms consistent with coronavirus.

It is not clear exactly what this would mean for a teenager unable to sit their exams, but there are mechanisms for allocating marks in exceptional circumstances, which have been used before.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Gallagher explains the UK's Coronavirus 'delay' phase

The Welsh government has been advised that school closures are not an appropriate move at the moment, though the situation remains under review.

The Scottish government has also said school closures would not be an effective measure at this stage.

The Republic of Ireland's decision to close schools, colleges and public childcare facilities until 29 March is likely to affect businesses in Northern Ireland's border region that employ staff from the Irish Republic.

In the meantime, many schools will continue to assess how technology could be used to continue pupils' learning in the event of isolated closures.

Sharon Bruton, chief executive of the Keys Federation Academy Trust in Wigan, whose schools use an artificial-intelligence learning platform, said teachers could set assignments via email and social media accounts.

""Schools are adaptable and flexible places - I'm certain school leaders and curriculum leaders will be thinking about how teaching can continue for their students should this be an eventuality,"" she said.

""Educators are remarkably resilient and adaptable and I think part of our job is to meet the needs of our children and make sure they can thrive in challenging circumstances - and this [coronavirus outbreak] won't be any different.""

So the possibility of blanket school closures has been kicked down the road, but that doesn't remove the uncertainty entirely.

No head teacher can rule out the possibility their school could be affected at some point. More pressing is the likelihood that the peak in cases could coincide with exams due to begin in mid-May.

This might mean more households isolating, more teachers off work.

One option could be to move some exams to later in June, when fewer are traditionally scheduled to take place.

This would prolong the agony for teenagers, and their families, but could increase the chances of most being able to sit the exams that are the passport to the next stage of their life.

In the meantime, despite expert advice, some parents continue to call for school closures.

The exams watchdogs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all urging teachers and students to prepare for the exams season as normal.

In Scotland, where exams start earlier than the rest of the UK, the Scottish Qualifications Authority said there was no change to the 2020 national-qualifications timetable.

""Current deadlines for coursework, and other assessments, remain in place,"" it added.

Oxford University ""intends to remain open until instructed otherwise"", despite six students having contracted coronavirus.

Vice-chancellor Louise Richardson said all British undergraduates should go home for the Easter break ""unless they have a compelling reason to stay"".

The university, which has about 24,000 students, will use online teaching and assessment from next month.

It said all students affected by coronavirus were ""recovering well"".

Prof Richardson said the university's Medical Science Division had now cancelled all clinical teaching until further notice ""to release clinical teachers to the wards"".

,Coronavirus: Republic of Ireland to close schools and colleges,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar announced the measures on Thursday morning

Schools, colleges and other public facilities in the Republic of Ireland are to close in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the measures take effect from 18:00 on Thursday until 29 March.

He said that Northern Ireland and the UK would be briefed on developments.

Some 27 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Ireland on Thursday, according to the Department of Health.

There are now 70 total confirmed cases in the country.

The first death linked to coronavirus in Ireland - involving an elderly woman with underlying health conditions - was announced on Wednesday.

Meanwhile two more people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 10.

There are now 596 confirmed cases in the UK.

On Thursday another two more cases were diagnosed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total to 20.

Making the announcement, Mr Varadkar added that indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 500 should be cancelled. He said people should work remotely if possible. Airports and ports will remain open.

Northern Ireland's schools and colleges will not close at this stage. First Minister Arlene Foster said NI would follow scientific advice.

Ireland's chief medical officer Tony Holohan said ""he recognises the differences"" on the island of Ireland in the way governments are dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak.

Mr Holohan said: ""We have assessed the situation from our point of view and we believe that closing schools is an important part of the strategy for the reasons of ultimately protecting older and vulnerable people from schoolchildren who may not be significantly affected in terms of the illness.""

Earlier on Thursday, stocks tumbled around the world after US President Donald Trump restricted travel to the US from mainland Europe in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The UK and Ireland were not included.

Mr Trump announced a ban on travellers from 26 European countries entering the United States for 30 days, starting on Friday.

Mr Varadkar said schools, colleges and childcare facilities will close from Friday and that the public and businesses needed to take a sensible approach.

The measures introduced in the Republic of Ireland will have a significant impact on Northern Ireland's border region, according to the managing director of O'Neill's sportswear firm.

It employs more than 750 staff at its factory in Strabane, County Tyrone, near the border with County Donegal in the Republic.

Kieran Kennedy said: ""That will be very challenging for a lot of our staff. It will have a real impact on our manufacturing.""

The taoiseach said he realised the restrictions would be a ""real shock"".

""It is going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives and I know I'm asking people to make enormous sacrifices but we're doing it for each other,"" Mr Varadkar said.

""Our economy will suffer but it will bounce back.

""Lost time in school or college will be recovered and in time our lives will go back to normal.

""Ireland is a great nation, we're great people, we've experienced hardship and struggle before, we've overcome many trials in the past.""

Mr Varadkar said shops should remain open and public transport will continue to operate.

In other developments:

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to sign off plans to move from the ""containment"" phase of the outbreak to ""delay"" at the emergency Cobra meeting later.

'Necessary and justified'

Later, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said the closures were ""necessary and justified"".

""We do need to respond with calm, with unity, with discipline and resolve,"" he said.

""These are the right measures at the right time based on the best public health advice.""

'Decisive and rapid'

Mr Holohan said the measures announced by the government were ""early, decisive, rapid, co-ordinated and comprehensive"" and offered the ""greatest chance of mitigating the impact"" of the outbreak.

""But it is not to say it is going to prevent an increase in cases. We expect to see that,"" he said.

"['Robbie Meredith', 'Bbc News Ni Education Correspondent']",Twenty-five post-primary schools to get extra places,"Image copyright Getty Images

Twenty-five post-primary schools are to get extra places for new pupils in 2020.

The Department of Education (DE) has created 443 additional places to cope with an expected increase in demand in some areas.

Twenty schools have also been given 361 extra places in expectation of increased pupil numbers in 2021.

The department had previously warned of pressures on post-primary places in 2020 and 2021.

As a result they had asked principals to apply for temporary increases in their pupil intake for those years.

In 2019, 226 pupils had not got a post-primary place when the initial transfer process concluded in June and there was concern that number could rise this year.

The number of pupils due to transfer in 2020 is 24,017, compared to 21,732 in 2017 - a rise of more than 10%.

Those figures do not include pupils with statements of special educational needs, who are placed through a different process.

'Focus on welfare of children'

The department has now decided that a number of post-primaries in Belfast, north Down, Strangford, Newry and Armagh, Fermanagh and south Tyrone, south Antrim and mid-Ulster will get extra places.

In Belfast Grosvenor Grammar, Ashfield Boys' and Girls' High schools, Strathearn College, Our Lady and St Patrick's Knock, St Malachy's College, Dominican College and Blessed Trinity College will admit between 10 and 30 more pupils in 2020.

In addition, Aquinas Grammar will admit 20 extra pupils in 2021, though none in 2020.

St Patrick's College in Dungannon will get 22 extra places in both 2020 and 2021 while the nearby St Patrick's Academy will admit 15 more pupils than normal in those years.

In Magherafelt, St Pius X College is to admit 30 extra pupils in both years while St Mary's Grammar is to admit 12 additional pupils.

Antrim Grammar will get 24 extra places in 2020 and 2021.

In Newry, St Colman's College will take 15 more pupils and Our Lady's Grammar will admit 28 more in 2020 and 2021.

St Paul's Bessbrook will take 30 additional pupils into year 8 in both years.

In north Down and Strangford, Bangor Academy, Bangor Grammar, St Columbanus College, Regent House, Saintfield High, Movilla High, Nendrum College, Glastry College and Strangford Integrated will all admit some extra pupils in 2020.

Five of those schools, mainly in Bangor, will admit extra pupils again in 2021.

Education Minister Peter Weir said his department had carried out a detailed analysis of where demand was greatest.

""In light of this, I have moved to provide additional Year 8 places in areas where pressure is expected to be highest and have authorised an additional 443 places in 2020 and 361 places in 2021,"" he said.

""My focus is on the welfare of children and to minimise stress on families at transition and I may authorise further increases during the admissions process if they are required.""

A number of schools have already sought permanent increases in enrolments which is a separate process.

Schools will still be able to apply for future temporary increases in their pupil numbers should admission pressures arise later in the transfer process.

,Zimbabwe crisis: Parents of school dropouts face jail,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Many schools opened up in Zimbabwe after independence in 1980

Parents in Zimbabwe could face up to two years in jail if they fail to send their children to school.

The government has made education compulsory up to the age of 16 to stem rising school dropout figures blamed on the poor state of the economy.

It is estimated that in some parts of the country 20% of children do not go to school.

The new law also makes it is an offence to expel children for non-payment of school fees or for becoming pregnant.

Last year at least 60% of the children in primary school were sent home for failing to pay fees, according to the state's Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVac).

Zimbabwe's first leader Robert Mugabe, a former teacher who died last year, was praised for the education policies he adopted after independence in 1980.

The school system he established gave black Zimbabwean greater access to education as hundreds of state schools were opened, leading to Zimbabweans enjoying among the highest literacy rates in Africa.

However, free education ended in the 1990s and in the following decade the education system began to crumble.

What has changed?

The education law has been amended to make sure children in Zimbabwe go to school for a total of 12 years, five years more than was previously prescribed.

Image copyright AFP Image caption State schools are also suffering from a shortage of resources

Parents are now also in the firing line if their offspring fail to go to school.

They face up two years in jail - or a $260 (£200) fine if they can afford to pay it - if their children are found not to be attending classes.

The BBC's Shingai Nyoka in the capital, Harare, says it seems to be a bold attempt to force parents to prioritise education during an economic crisis.

But some believe the government is shirking its responsibilities amidst broken promises to provide free basic education and a chronic shortage of state schools.

The high drop-out rate has also been blamed on pregnancy, early marriages, the long distances to schools and a lack of interest, our reporter adds.

Why are children dropping out?

By Shingai Nyoka, BBC News, Harare

Parents have been spending less on education as they struggle to buy food. Fees at government-run schools must be paid up front and range from between $30 (£23) and $700 a year, depending on where they are based.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Unregistered schools don't insist on school uniforms

Last year, parents spent a third what they did in 2018 on education, says ZimVac.

In a sign of the desperate times, makeshift schools in poor areas of the capital, like Epworth, have been sprouting up in homes and backyards. They are unregistered - and therefore illegal. They can work out cheaper - about $3 a month - though their main draw is their flexibility about when the fees are paid.

Eunice Maronga, who runs one of these schools, says the children bring in money if and when they can. They are also more flexible about uniforms, though a $3-education has its drawbacks: no desks and one textbook - for the teacher.

""The reason why there is an increase in unregistered schools is because of the shortage of government schools - to the tune of about 2,000 schools,"" says Liberty Matsive, from the non-governmental organisation Education Coalition of Zimbabwe.

Elizabeth Chibanda, whose children are at home after her food-vending business collapsed, says she has sent her eight-year-old daughter back to her home village.

""She is doing nothing in the village, but I was ashamed to have a grade-three student sitting around, when it's so obvious to everyone she should be in school.""

Ms Chibanda said she was unable to get her son, who is six, into grade one at the start of the school year in January: ""With my son, I can pretend he is not of school-going age yet.""

Why is the economy is such bad shape?

Mr Mugabe was ousted from power in November 2017 with the hope that his army-backed successor and former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, would help revive the economy.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About 89% of adult Zimbabweans can read and write - among the highest literacy rates in Africa, according to 2014 World Bank data

But things have gone from bad to worse - and a decade on from the hyperinflation that devastated the economy, Zimbabwe is again facing rampant inflation, frequent shortages of foreign currency, food, fuel, electricity and medicine.

The country, which was once a major food producer, is also currently in the middle of a drought.

Last week, the US extended sanctions against Zimbabwe's top leaders, citing their actions to ""undermine democratic processes or institutions"", persecuting critics and economic mismanagement.

President Mnangagwa has blamed sanctions for crippling development in the country.

But Washington says their economic impact is limited to the farms and companies owned by about 80 of the targeted individuals, who include the president.

Staff at an infant school are frequently the target of violence from pupils, a report has found.

Ofsted inspectors found pupils at St George's Infant School and Nursery in Colchester ""throw things in lessons"" and some ""fail to follow basic rules"".

Inspectors said the majority of pupils behaved well, but ""not enough is done to stop the unacceptable behaviour of a few"" and rated the school inadequate.

The school said it was ""working hard"" to act upon ""lessons learned"".

The inspection in January, which followed a one in which the school was rated as requiring improvement, found ""standards achieved by pupils currently in the school are still poor"".

""This is because the curriculum is not planned or taught well enough,"" inspectors said, adding attendance at the school ""has not been high enough"".

'Violence from pupils'

Inspectors said: ""Behaviour management has improved, but is not having sufficient impact. There are frequent assaults on staff by pupils.

""While the majority of pupils behave well, not enough is done to stop the unacceptable behaviour of a few.

""Staff feel protected from bullying and harassment, but they do not feel protected from violence from pupils.""

The report found ""pupils fall behind because some teachers have low expectations and no clear plans to set out what they should teach"".

It added too many pupils with special educational needs or those with disabilities ""do not receive the support they should"".

Inspectors acknowledged the school, which has no permanent head teacher, was ""in a period of change"".

Carl Messer, interim executive head teacher, said they were ""already working hard to ensure that the lessons learned from the recent inspection by Ofsted are being swiftly acted upon"".

It follows a campaign by Croydon mum Catriona Ogilvy which has been backed by over 350,000 people.

Current law states maternity and paternity leave begins the day after birth even if a baby is born premature.

Treasury minister Kemi Badenoch said the government would pay the extra leave, rather than businesses.

Mrs Ogilvy - who spent time in a neonatal ward after her son, Samuel, was born 10 weeks early - has petitioned to extend parental leave following premature birth since 2015.

Her campaigning has seen the Mayor of London, Sony Music and a number of London councils adopt policies to give extra leave to staff who have babies born early.

Image copyright Catriona Ogilvy Image caption Catriona Ogilvy with her two sons Samuel and Jack

It is expected that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will outline plans for Neonatal Pay and Leave on Wednesday to allow new mothers and fathers to claim statutory paid leave for every week their child is in neonatal care, up to a maximum of 12 weeks.

Mrs Badenoch, the Minister for Equalities, told the Sunday Times the move would be ""historic"".

""This will be in addition to the usual maternity and paternity leave, and finally give parents the time, the resources and the space to handle these difficult circumstances,"" she said.

,Amber Rudd 'no platformed' by Oxford University society,"Image caption Amber Rudd was home secretary from July 2016 until she resigned in April 2018

Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd says she had an invitation to speak at an Oxford University society pulled half an hour before she was due to appear.

Ms Rudd, who stepped down as an MP in December, was due to speak to the UN Women Oxford UK society on Thursday.

Following a vote of its committee, understood to relate to her role in the Windrush scandal, the invitation was pulled.

Ms Rudd said some students' treatment of her was ""badly judged and rude"".

She had been due to speak about UN Women's Draw A Line campaign and her experiences of being an MP and minister for women and equalities.

Ms Rudd urged students to ""stop hiding and start engaging"".

She resigned as home secretary in April 2018 after people living legally in the UK were detained and deported and she inadvertently misled a Commons committee about the number of people who had been involved.

The UN Women Oxford UK society wrote on Facebook on Thursday: ""Following a majority vote in committee, tonight's event with speaker Amber Rudd has been cancelled.

It added it was ""deeply sorry for all and any hurt caused"" over the event.

Earlier in the week, it said the conversation with Ms Rudd would have been ""an honest and frank conversation"" about how her policies had impacted women of all races.

It had urged students to attend the event ""to help campaign for a truly frank feminism which is not afraid of taking opportunities to discuss issues with high profile figures"".

Later charity UN Women UK distanced itself from the row, and announced the student group involved had changed its name to United Women Oxford Student Society.

,Coronavirus elderly advice: How can I look after my older relatives?,"Image copyright EPA

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drop-off point to receive samples of the coronavirus for testing at Leeds General Infirmary

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

""We're all reaching that critical point now where we have to take stock and go, if I go to my parents I could be carrying something that could kill them. That's the reality of it.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Some people are wearing face masks although the government does not advise it

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The government has said there was ""no need"" for coronavirus stockpiling

Mental health charity Mind also has tips for those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

,Will UK schools close over coronavirus?,"Image copyright Cransley School Image caption Cransley School in Cheshire has been closed over coronavirus symptom fears

Some UK schools have closed over fears pupils and staff members may have been exposed to coronavirus after travelling abroad during the half-term break.

Others have sent pupils and staff home, as the illness continues to spread across Europe.

However, Public Health England (PHE) says it is not advising schools to shut to stem the spread of the virus.

Why are some schools closing their doors?

One academy chain chief executive told BBC News the decision to close one of his schools - Trinity Catholic College, in Middlesbrough - was primarily about the school's duty of care towards pupils and staff.

Hugh Hegarty, head of the Nicholas Postgate Catholic Academy Trust, which oversees the closed school, said he had made the decision after 36 pupils and eight staff members returned from a skiing trip to Italy over half-term.

""It's important people acknowledge that schools and other organisations have a duty of care to staff and have a duty of care to their children - and that is my paramount concern,"" said Mr Hegarty.

""The challenge for us was... the children had returned to school on Monday, so there had been the potential that the total school population had been exposed - even though it was minimal - to the potential risk and potential threat.

""The decision was made to advise those parents who had children on the ski trip to self-isolate and the other students to remain at home until we commence a deep clean.""

In Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the ContinU Plus Academy closed for the day on Wednesday after a staff member had been in ""close contact"" with a family member self-isolating following a trip to northern Italy.

William Martin Church of England Junior, Infant and Nursery School in Harlow, Essex, also closed on Wednesday after a staff member had returned from Italy.

Head teacher Gina Bailey said: ""The school is closed for one day and it is purely as a precaution. The staff member is not displaying any symptoms of the virus.""

But other schools have decided not to close following ski trips to northern Italy.

At St Aldhelm's Academy, in Dorset, head teacher Jon Webb wrote to parents: ""As it currently stands, we are not aware of anyone returning from the ski trip who are displaying symptoms that would cause us to have any concerns.""

What is the official advice to schools?

PHE's medical director Prof Paul Cosford acknowledged schools had to take ""difficult decisions given the complexity of the issues that they're facing"".

""Of course, schools have difficult decisions to take - a whole range of issues to take into account and we are able to talk to them about their specific circumstances and help them make the right decisions for them,"" he said.

""But what I would say is that our general advice is not to close schools.""

Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""no blanket closure"" for schools and the ""goal was to keep schools open"".

""If anyone has been in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or an educational setting, no special measures are required while test results are awaited,"" Mr Hancock told MPs.

""There is no need to close the school or send other students or staff home.

""Once the results arrive, those who test negative will be advised individually about returning to education.

""In most cases, closure of the childcare or education setting will be unnecessary but this will be a local decision based on various factors including professional advice.""

Head teachers in England should contact their regional schools commissioners should they need advice, he added.

Dr Bharat Pankhania, from University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""If you have returned from the area of northern Italy that is currently in lockdown since 19 February, you need to self-isolate, as per the advice from Public health England and the UK government.

""However, there's no need for a school to close. There are consequences to closing schools.

""It's disproportionate and it gives the wrong impression. It makes people extremely concerned, when there's no need to be.""

Official government guidance for educational settings says if a pupil or member of staff is confirmed as having coronavirus, anyone who has been ""in close face-to-face or touching contact, including those undertaking small group work (within 2m [6ft] of the case for more than 15 minutes)"" should self-isolate at home, or within their boarding school dormitory room, for 14 days"".

Does parental pressure affect head teachers' decisions?

Some parents have expressed concern via social media about their child coming into contact with the coronavirus, particularly if fellow pupils have been away in northern Italy.

But while some parents want to see schools closed, others do not want their child's education to be disrupted.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Schools listen carefully to the views of parents and they will obviously have regard to this feedback in making decisions over how to respond to any situation regarding coronavirus.

""However, it is often the case that different parents will have different views over an unfolding event, so school leaders have to take this range of opinion on board, together with the views of other stakeholders, and make a judgement on what response serves the best interests of all pupils and staff.""

Could there be an impact on the exam season?

With the exam season coming up next term, some teachers, parents and young people may be worried about disruption to important exams.

But the exams watchdog Ofqual said it was monitoring the situation closely and students should not be concerned.

""We routinely consider whether there are particular risks to the smooth running of exams and we are working closely with the exam boards and with the Department for Education,"" a spokesman said.

""We will update our existing guidance to reflect any specific arrangements schools and colleges should put in place if required.

""In the meantime, students should continue to prepare for the summer exams as usual and schools and colleges should ensure their contingency plans are up to date.""

Mr Barton added: ""We would urge students who are studying for their exams not to worry about what may or may not happen with regards to coronavirus and to concentrate on preparing for these important qualifications.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,BBC,Education,True
,Coronavirus: Schools told no delays so far to exams,"Image copyright PA Media Image caption There have been worries about the impact of coronavirus as the exam season approaches

The exam watchdog, responding to concerns about coronavirus, is telling schools in England to keep preparing as usual for the summer exam season.

Ofqual says it is working with exam boards and the government to make contingency plans if there is a ""widespread outbreak"".

But until that becomes necessary, the watchdog is telling schools to assume exams will continue as scheduled.

Most GCSEs and A-level exams are planned to run from early May.

On Monday, Ofqual issued advice that ""students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer exams and assessments as usual"".

But it said there would be guidance to ""manage any particular risks"" to the exam season if coronavirus became widespread.

The watchdog said it would send any updated information when necessary - and also shared existing contingency plans for exams being disrupted.

This covers emergencies that might happen during the exam season - which could see pupils having to take an exam in a different location from their own school or rearranging the time of an exam.

But these responses are usually for problems facing a small number of individual schools, pupils or staff.

So far, more than 20 schools have been closed at some point in response to concerns over coronavirus - and others have sent home pupils, such as those who had returned from a half-term trip to an area with higher levels of the virus.

'Best advice'

In the most recent cases involving the virus, there were reports of a member of staff infected in a primary school in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and in an infant school in Woodley, Berkshire.

But some of these schools will have returned to normal - and the great majority of the school system, with more than 24,000 schools in England, does not seem to have been significantly affected by the virus.

With the exam revision season already bringing its own stresses, ASCL head teachers' union Geoff Barton said: ""Schools and colleges will be approaching the possibility of the coronavirus situation disrupting exams in a calm and measured manner, hoping for the best and preparing for the worst.

""We would urge students to focus on studying for their exams and not to worry about what may or may not happen.""

National Association of Head Teachers leader Paul Whiteman said: ""Our best advice to school leaders is to encourage them to stay on top of the continually updated advice from the government, share it with pupils and their families and act accordingly.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51707144,BBC,Education,True
"['Sean Coughlan', 'Bbc News']",Is the new passport really blue or black?,"Image caption The new passport (left) is a return to the ""iconic blue"" of the old one, the Home Office says

Is the new UK passport blue? Or is the colour really closer to black?

The Home Office has issued pictures of the post-Brexit passport, describing it as a return to the ""iconic blue"" used for UK passports before 1988.

Experts in the science of colour - and instant experts on social media - are unconvinced, saying they look more like black.

But a Home Office spokesman says the colours of both the old and new passports are shades of blue.

""I'd say it's black,"" says Stephen Westland, professor of colour science and technology at the University of Leeds.

""If most people looked at this, they'd say it's black.""

But he says describing colours in terms of names can be imprecise - and individuals will have their own different perspectives.

If enough blue is added to black, he says there will be a transition point when people will begin to see the colour as blue.

""But that point varies for different people,"" he says.

That means that some might see a colour as an extremely dark shade of blue, while others would see it as black.

Perhaps allowing the Home Office not to be entirely painted into a corner, he suggests the colour might be ""bluish black"".

But in essence, Prof Westland says, ""this is closer to black"".

However he says the perception of colour can be influenced by its context - and by calling it a ""blue passport"" people might be more likely to see it as leaning towards blue.

Replacing the burgundy-coloured European Union document, the new UK passport has been described as a return to the ""traditional colour"".

Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the return to this ""iconic blue"" was ""entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one"".

The Home Office would not specify the shade of this blue, although a spokesman said it was close to, if not exactly, a blue numbered as 5395C in the Pantone classification.

But Craig Burston, senior lecturer in graphic design at the London College of Communication, which incorporates what was the London College of Printing, says there is nothing to suggest the ""dominant colour"" of the new passport is blue.

He suggests the colour is charcoal, maybe with a hint of blue.

But if it is blue, ""it must be the most apologetic shade of blue they could find"" because ""it's as black as blue gets"".

""You'd be hard pushed to get something that is darker that would be defined as blue,"" Mr Burston says.

""It's as near as damn it black.""

Skip Twitter post by @EveOrEvie Can we stop fighting about whether the passports are blue or black, the word Navy exists for a reason. — Evie (@EveOrEvie) March 2, 2020 Report

There could be differences depending on printing processes, lighting and the ""sheen"", he says.

But the question of the colour seems to have been mixed up with the politics of ""blue passports"".

And the social-media debate seems to be about Brexit as much as colour charts.

A spokesman for paint company Farrow and Ball says ""pure"" black would have no other colours added.

But in practice, blacks used in the ""everyday world would have a slight colour to them"", such as blue, grey or red.

This could make the passport a very dark blue although ""some people may perceive it as black"".

It is ""probably black blue,"" said the paint firm's spokesman.

There have been other internet debates over identifying colours - such as whether a dress was blue or white and gold.

Prof Westland says this reflects how people tend to see colours in quite definite ways, coming down on one side or the other, even though we know there are all kinds of shades and ambiguities.

"['Hannah Richardson', 'Education', 'Social Affairs Reporter']",Legal victories over 'No DSS' letting agents,"Image caption Ms Staples needed accommodation after her marriage broke down

The battle against the discriminatory practice of landlords not renting to benefit claimants has intensified after legal victories by two single mothers.

Amanda Staples and Emma Loffler both won out-of-court settlements against ""No DSS"" letting agents, on the grounds of indirect discrimination.

In a 2018 case, another single mother, Rosie Keogh, backed by charity Shelter, successfully argued blanket bans on claimants indirectly discriminated against women and disabled people who are more likely to be on benefits.

Ms Keogh's case was cited in letters of complaint Ms Staples and Ms Loffler wrote to different letting agents who had refused to show them properties.

Shelter took on their legal cases when the agents refused to budge.

Personal circumstances

Ms Staples, 36, who has three primary-aged children, needed accommodation after her marriage broke down.

""I kept ringing around estate agents and when I said I would be a housing benefit [claimant] it was a blanket 'No,'"" she said.

When a property came up in the Cambridgeshire village she was based in, she was initially excited but then hit a wall.

""I had noticed 'No DSS' adverts before but I thought I would be able to find somewhere locally so my children could still go to the same school and so I could keep my job there,"" she said.

""It was really uncomfortable to keep having to explain my personal circumstances to strangers.

""The whole thing was so difficult - I was working part time, I've always paid my rent, I had a child-maintenance order, and I ended up on benefits because of the divorce and because I had three children.""

Ms Staples offered to pay six months' rent up-front, and then 12 months' after an offer of a loan from her father, but the letting agent kept saying the landlord's insurance did not cover tenants on benefits.

Image caption After Shelter supported her legal action, Ms Staples's boys were able to stay at the same school

She said: ""After a while, talking to this one particular estate agent, I just said; 'Nothing I say is going to make any difference is it?' And he said, 'No.'""

With Shelter backing her legal action, the letting agent ultimately agreed to write a public letter of apology and to pay £3,000 compensation and the £10,000 legal costs.

The agent in Ms Loffler's case, meanwhile, also issued a public letter of apology and paid £3,500 compensation and £2,500 towards legal costs.

'Grossly unfair'

Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said: ""The message is clear - letting agents and landlords must not treat potential tenants as second-class citizens simply because they rely on benefits.

""If they continue to blindly discriminate against those receiving housing benefit, they risk legal action and a hefty fine.

""Not only is 'No DSS' discrimination outdated and grossly unfair, it is unlawful under the Equality Act because it overwhelming impacts women and disabled people, who are more likely to need support paying their rent.""

Image caption Ms Loffler was paid £3,500 compensation

The housing charity analysed 7,100 adverts on the biggest letting agent websites, including OpenRent, Rightmove, Countrywide and Zoopla, and found more than one in 10 contained phrases such as ""No DSS"" or similar.

Agents and landlords could face fines of about £5,000 per advert based on the three payouts made in cases so far, it said.

But a poll of 1,009 private landlords for the charity by YouGov in December 2019 and January 2020 revealed:

86% thought ""No DSS"" was lawful or were not sure

29% said they did not currently let to people receiving housing benefit and were advised not to by their letting agent

The Residential Landlords Association urged the government to:

stop lenders preventing a landlord from renting to benefit claimants as a condition of their buy-to-let mortgage,

align housing benefit with local rent levels

restore the right of tenants to choose to have the housing element of their benefit paid directly to their landlord

How to fight 'No DSS' landlords and letting agents

Keep a written note of phone and face-to-face conversations if you start to hear a ""No DSS"" message. Hold on to any emails.

Ensure there is no other reason the agent will not let you rent

Provide agents with evidence of previous reliability and ability to pay with housing benefit

"['Sean Coughlan', 'Bbc News Family', 'Education Correspondent']",Biggest earners and biggest losers from degrees,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption University leaders say the value of higher education should be measured in more than just earning power

Higher pay still makes it financially beneficial to go to university for most students in England, says research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

But 20% are worse off after paying for courses, says the study commissioned by the Department for Education.

Over their working lives, male graduates on average gain by £130,000 and female graduates by £100,000.

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says students and taxpayers needed to get value from their ""investment"".

The government has promised to tackle ""low quality"" courses.

But university leaders say there can be other forms of social and personal ""value"" from higher education, as well as measurements of graduate earnings.

The study on projected earnings, based on tax data, shows wide variations in the financial winners and losers between different subjects.

For women, the financial gains of studying creative arts and languages are ""close to zero""

Medicine will bring an extra £340,000 for women, economics £270,000 and £260,000 for law

Men studying creative arts subjects are projected to lose £100,000, compared to their counterparts who did not go to university

For men in the top-earning subject areas of medicine and economics, the likely gain is £500,000

For both men and women there are low financial returns for graduates in English and biology

Individual universities are not identified, but more selective universities tend to lead to bigger earnings

These gains and losses are counted after the cost of going to university has been deducted.

This includes £9,250 per year in tuition fees, loans for living costs, interest charged on loans and lost potential earnings from studying rather than being in jobs.

The average student graduates with about £50,000 in debt.

More women go to university than men - and a higher proportion of women, 85%, compared with 75% of men, will get a positive financial return.

But female graduates have lower lifetime earnings, which the analysis says is likely to reflect women taking time off or reducing hours when they have children.

The gender gap in earnings opens when graduates are in their 30s - although the data does not distinguish between part-time and full-time work so part-time could look like lower pay.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The study will raise questions about which subjects should be funded

But for 70,000 students each year the costs of going to university - such as fees, loans and lost earnings while they studied - will be greater than any extra money they make in earnings, so they make less than their counterparts who went to work straight after A-levels.

Ben Waltmann, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the public finances gained on average from higher education, ""because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax"".

That still meant that government finances had to subsidise almost half of individual graduates - with the biggest losses concentrated in subjects such as creative arts.

There have been suggestions that funding could be restricted for degrees offering poor value to students.

And these findings are published as the government prepares its response to Philip Augar's review of student finance.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graduates with economics degrees are among the highest earners

This recommended that tuition fees should be cut to £7,500 and that students needed better value for money.

The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, is also carrying out a review into how funding grants should be prioritised between different subjects.

But the UCU lecturers' union has warned against making simplistic links between the quality of a course and future salaries.

""Earnings potential is also heavily impacted by factors such as an individual's background, their parents' jobs, their gender, where they are from and where they live after graduating,"" says union leader Jo Grady.

And she said decisions about the value of courses needed to reflect ""the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society"".

Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said it was crucial that university applicants had ""clear and factual information"" and ""data on earnings potential is an important part of that picture"".

Others argued that apprenticeships were better value.

""This analysis is fresh evidence of how the current university model is broken,"" said Euan Blair, co-founder of apprenticeship provider WhiteHat.

""Young people are being pressured to go to university without any consideration given to whether the experience will be positive or if they'll be equipped to pursue the career they want,"" he said.

But even when earnings might be relatively low, graduates might be working in sectors making ""vital contributions to the wider economy and society"", said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK.

He said it was important to recognise that the ""benefits of a degree stretch far beyond salary outcomes"".

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan also highlighted the ""unquantifiable experiences and friendships"" of university.

But she said the reputation of the university sector depended on ""quality"" and that had to be safeguarded so that ""students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51676530,BBC,Education,True

""It's educated people who are causing the most damage to the planet,"" says sixth-former Joe Brindle.

Joe, 17, says schools need to put the environment at the heart of education.

Ministers agree ""it is vital that pupils are taught about climate change"" but Joe says schools are failing to prepare them for a climate emergency.

He is a founder member of Teach the Future which next week takes its call for an environmental overhaul of education to Parliament.

""It's people with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge who are becoming fossil-fuel chief executives and they are the ones who are causing the most destruction to our world,"" says Joe.

""And therefore that kind of shows that education is not succeeding and that our education is broken because education should be creating better people not worse.""

On Wednesday, Joe, a pupil at Devizes School, and more than a dozen other under-18s who make up the core of Teach the Future, will take over Parliament's Terrace Pavilion to host a crowdfunded reception for MPs.

The group, run jointly by the UK Student Climate Network, best known for the school climate strikes, and the National Union of Students' climate charity offshoot, SOS-UK, is launching a draft English emergency education bill which embodies their key demands and which Joe believes ""is going to be really big"".

Teach the Future is hoping the draft could at some stage form the basis of a private member's bill but for now, the aim is ""to get MPs on our side"".

The idea is based on the 1958 US National Defense Education Act which aimed to kickstart engineering, maths and science education and give America the edge in the space and arms races.

It paid off - by July 1969, the average age in Apollo mission control was just 28.

""I think it really shows that education can be used to solve a difficult problem, if the focus is down from the government,"" says Joe, who will sit A-levels in history, biology and chemistry this summer.

Image copyright TRW/PhotoQuest/Getty Images Image caption Most mission control staff on Nasa's Apollo programme were in their 20s

But rather than focusing exclusively on science, technology, engineering and maths - the range of the climate emergency education act needs to be far wider, he believes.

""The space race was just one thing but the climate crisis affects every single part of everything and it requires solutions from every single part of society, whether it be arts, whether it be maths, whether it be sciences.""

He wants everyone to understand the impact of their behaviour on the environment and ""try to do things in a way that has as little negative impact as you can"".

And while engineers have an important role, fundamentally, education needs to become more sustainable, he says.

People need to understand how the climate crisis happened, he argues: ""It's a symptom of a general unsustainable system.""

Image copyright Joe Brindle Image caption Joe speaking at the NUS Sustainability Summit in November 2019

Joe believes most people his age ""want to understand more about climate change and what's behind it, the issues of justice... and the politics behind it"".

But he says that while schools are largely sympathetic, they are constrained by limited budgets and the demands of a high-stakes exam system - and often teachers themselves lack detailed knowledge about climate change.

""It's not good enough that sustainability is restricted to a few subjects and most of our teachers and lecturers don't know enough about it,"" say the campaigners.

They also point out that including climate change in the national curriculum will only affect local authority schools - not academies, free schools or the private sector.

The group has invited dozens of MPs to the reception and are ""particularly hoping government ministers and people close to the government will be there"".

Zero-carbon schools

Teach the Future's wish-list also includes having climate science and sustainability included in teacher training and all education buildings to have a net-zero carbon footprint by 2030.

The group was founded in autumn 2019 but already has support from leading education unions and environmental organisations. It is hoping that several dozen MPs will attend the reception.

In a statement, the government said: ""It is vital that pupils are taught about climate change, which is why topics are included across the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools. Teachers have the freedom to expand on these areas if they wish.

""This government is a world leader in tackling climate change and we are the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. The Department for Education provides funding to support schools to become more sustainable institutions.""

A spokesperson said topics related to climate change and sustainability were included in the national curriculum for science and geography, a new environmental science A-level was introduced in 2017 and sustainability will be included in some new T-level technical qualifications, for example, construction students will learn about renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies.

Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to protect themselves from coronavirus.

When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

The government is to release social distancing advice for elderly people on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods.

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35.

Mr Hancock told the BBC that manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS.

He also said hotels could be converted into makeshift hospitals, while the government has begun negotiating with private healthcare providers to obtain thousands of extra beds in private hospitals.

What are the latest figures?

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest Department of Health figures.

Almost all of the new cases were in England, but 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

Most of the 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK have so far been people aged over 60 and with underlying health conditions.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are no longer being tested. The government says tests will primarily be given:

To all patients needing hospital treatment for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

What are the government's plans?

Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would soon be asked to self-isolate - but he did not say for how long.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends as long as they stayed 2m (6ft) away from them.

The health secretary also said the NHS would stop non-urgent surgery and retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those with the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19.

The Scottish government said it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.""

Scottish ministers have also advised against gatherings of 500 people or more. They do not have the power to call off events but have urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" by cancelling such gatherings from Monday.

Who are the latest victims?

Image copyright Nick Matthews Facebook Image caption Mary Matthews paid tribute to her husband, Nick, on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""best friend""

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol, who died at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"".

She urged people not to visit her and her family until their own test results for the virus came back.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, on 29 February.

How many ventilators are needed?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment - but that many times that number would be needed.

Car companies and weapon manufacturers are among the firms the government has asked to help to make ventilators to treat Covid-19 patients.

Ventilators treat severe breathing problems caused by Covid-19 by giving people oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from their lungs.

Digger manufacturer JCB said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if it could help.

JCB chairman Lord Bamford said it was ""unclear"" whether the firm could agree to do so, but that engineers were ""actively looking"" at the request.

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks.

That's why it's essential people don't start too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self-isolating.

But officials recognise individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

"['Tom Burridge', 'Transport Correspondent', 'Bbc News']",Train companies seek bailout as coronavirus hits passenger numbers,"Image copyright Getty Images

The government is in talks with rail bosses to put emergency measures in place to deal with falling passenger numbers after the coronavirus outbreak.

Some train operators were already losing money but fewer fares will put even more pressure on their finances.

A senior industry source said fairly drastic measures might be required for train companies to survive.

At an industry meeting last week, passenger numbers were said to have fallen by up to 18% on certain lines.

However, another industry source acknowledged that the fall in passengers could be significantly higher.

They told the BBC that the number of passengers travelling through major UK train stations at peak times had dropped considerably in recent days.

Very up-to-date figures for the whole UK network are not known as many tickets are still not purchased digitally, so it takes some time for the data to filter through.

Under franchise agreements, train companies have a range of contractual obligations, which govern how many trains they run and restrict how much they can charge for tickets.

They are also required to make payments to the government to run services on parts of the rail network.

The number of trains, the price of tickets and the amount companies pay government are all calculated based on assumptions about passenger numbers.

But, with fewer people catching the train - as some companies ask staff to work from home over fears about the spread of the coronavirus - the ability of rail companies to meet some of those obligations is now in doubt.

Emergency talks

The BBC understands that train operators are in talks with government to renegotiate the terms of some of those contracts.

Train companies want the government to give them more wriggle room so they can keep operating services for essential travel for people working in the emergency services, even though broader passenger numbers have fallen.

Options being discussed are likely to include a reduction in the number of train services and flexibility over the payments that train companies make to government.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""We recognise how difficult the current situation is for the transport sector and, across government, we are engaging with the sector's leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51896169,BBC,Politics,True
,Coronavirus: Supermarkets ask shoppers to be 'considerate' and stop stockpiling,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves

Supermarkets are urging shoppers not to buy more than they need amid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.

In a joint letter, UK retailers have reminded customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items.

""There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" it adds.

It comes after some shops began rationing the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely.

In the letter, the retailers say online and click-and-collect services are at ""full capacity"" and staff and suppliers are ""working day and night to keep the nation fed"".

The retailers say they are working ""closely"" with government and suppliers to make more deliveries to stores so that shelves are well-stocked.

""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without,"" the letter reads.

That was echoed in an email to customers from Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who said: ""There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked.""

In a plea to shoppers, he said: ""Please think before you buy and only buy what you and your family need.""

Skip Twitter post by @ViewdataUK I was laughing at people stockpiling toilet roll.. But now that I actually need to buy some, it's getting a bit beyond a joke. Even the kleenex is all gone. Not happy. pic.twitter.com/Zql9wva7IO — Rob (@ViewdataUK) March 14, 2020 Report

Speaking on behalf of retailers, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.""

The plea follows widespread concern over shoppers emptying supermarket shelves as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus.

Long queues were reported outside some supermarkets on Sunday morning.

Items including toilet paper, hand sanitiser, pasta and tinned foods are among those that have been in short supply.

That has led some supermarkets to limit the sale of some products, while Aldi has restricted customers to buying a maximum of four of each item.

Tesco, shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including anti-bacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables.

Meanwhile, Waitrose has brought in a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes.

Boots and Asda are both restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person.

Campaigners have warned stockpiling could hit the ""most vulnerable"" hardest.

Analysis

By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent

Supermarkets are used to spikes in demand, for example over the festive period. But they have usually been expecting them.

It has been clear from repeatedly emptied shelves that many shoppers have not heeded the official advice that there is no need to stockpile.

The BRC lobby group insists its members are resilient and there won't be long-term shortages. And supermarkets have adapted quickly. For example, Sainsbury's has told customers today that it has increased warehouse capacity and ordered more stock. Tesco is among the brands that will take up the government's offer of extending delivery hours to keep up with demand.

But with demand unprecedented for the time of year - weeks before the expected UK peak of the pandemic - this unusual joint letter from the major supermarkets shows they feel a strong message needs sending to customers. They will be hoping that the coordinated effort will help their strained supply chains cope and ensure everyone, including the most vulnerable, can get what they need.

Some food banks say they have a shortage of basic items which have already been panic bought by shoppers.

The government has said there is no need for anyone to stockpile items, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging people to ""behave responsibly and think about others"".

The government is relaxing restrictions on delivery hours for retailers to try to ensure shops remain stocked with basic items.

Deliveries to supermarkets are usually restricted overnight to avoid disturbing local residents.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said allowing night-time deliveries would allow stock to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

Meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog has warned retailers not to ""exploit"" fears about coronavirus by dramatically increasing the price of protective goods such as hand gels and face masks.

,Coronavirus: English local elections postponed for a year,"Image copyright Getty Images

Local and mayoral elections in England will be postponed for a year to May 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Downing Street said it would be impractical to hold the elections as planned, as they would come during the peak of the spread of the virus.

Polls were due in 118 English councils, the London Assembly and for seven English regional mayors.

Voting was also due to take place for the London mayor and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.

It comes after the Electoral Commission said on Thursday the elections should be delayed until the autumn to ""mitigate"" the impact of the virus.

Meanwhile, visitor access to Parliament will be restricted from Monday, and MPs and peers are being ""strongly"" discouraged from making overseas trips.

Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the ""proportionate and reasonable"" measures would help preserve the operation of Parliament during the outbreak.

Ten people have died with the virus, with 798 cases confirmed UK-wide.

The Cabinet Office said it would be bringing forward legislation to enact the elections delay in England, and would ensure the Welsh authorities had the same powers.

The last time elections were delayed was in 2001, when they took place one month late due to the foot and mouth outbreak.

Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the move to delay the polls was the ""right decision"".

But he added it was ""not clear"" why the government had opted for a year-long delay, rather than postpone until the autumn as the Electoral Commission recommended.

Before the postponement was announced, Labour had backed calls for a delay, adding it had ""serious concerns"" about the welfare of party staff and members.

Labour General Secretary Jennie Formby wrote to local party branches earlier on Friday advising them to suspend campaigning ahead of the polls.

Defending the decision to delay the polls, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said it was important ""everyone feels confident they are able to take part"".

""Respecting the annual cycle of local government, postponing them seems to me in the circumstance to be the right thing to do,"" he added.

'Uncharted territory'

James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ""The LGA has been raising a number of issues with government including the possible impact of coronavirus on local elections. The swift decision is very helpful.

""Councils will now continue to put all of their efforts into supporting their local communities as the nation tackles Covid-19.""

The decision to delay the polls was also backed by the Association of Electoral Administrators.

Its chief executive Peter Stanyon said: ""This is uncharted territory and our members have been raising significant concerns about the safe delivery of these elections.""

Political events delayed

Labour has cancelled the special conference in London at which it was due to announce the result of its leadership election on 4 April.

The party said on Thursday it would instead put on a ""scaled-back event"" instead.

The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and Welsh Labour have all cancelled their spring conferences due to the spread of the virus.

The SNP and Scottish Conservatives have also announced their spring conferences will be postponed.

Only one MP, health minister Nadine Dorries, has tested positive for the virus - but an increasing number are self-isolating after either feeling unwell or learning that colleagues they have recently mingled with now have the virus.

Speaking on Friday, Mr Buckland said there was currently ""no evidence"" to suggest that keeping Parliament open posed a ""public health issue in itself"".

But he added: ""If that evidence and information changes, then we'll have to take appropriate steps.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51876269,BBC,Politics,True

Prison staff will be offered bonuses to cover shortages - and staff could be redeployed to cover front-line services.

A number of inmates died during unrest at several Italian prisons last week after visits were suspended.

The Prison Officers Association has compared conditions in England's prisons to those found on cruise ships and the Prison Governors Association has said cases of the virus are inevitable.

BBC News has seen advice issued to prisons, which says inmates who had contact with a known coronavirus patient should be isolated in single accommodation.

It is understood plans being drawn in up in Whitehall involve communicating regularly with inmates, making sure they can contact their families and providing extra materials - like books and magazines - to those isolating to try to avoid boredom.

The possibility of designating other buildings as prisons to cope with pressures has not been ruled out.

Senior figures do not believe large numbers of prisoners will have to be released to cope with any strain.

There is, however, significant concern about the impact on older prisoners with underlying health issues.

,Brexit: EU drafts trade deal ahead of talks with UK,"Image copyright Getty Images

The EU has drafted a post-Brexit trade deal proposal, covering areas such as security, foreign policy and fisheries.

The 441-page draft legal text, seen by the BBC, was sent to the 27 EU states on Thursday night, ahead of being presented to the UK next week.

But the BBC's Adam Fleming said much of the draft will be rejected by the UK because of references to EU law.

The two negotiating teams were due to meet in London for talks, but that has been cancelled due to coronavirus.

A joint statement from the UK and EU said they were ""exploring alternative ways to continue discussions"", such as video conferencing.

The UK left the EU at the end of January and entered the so-called transition phase, where the country continues to abide by most of the bloc's rules while a trade deal is negotiated.

Boris Johnson has said if an agreement is not made by the end of 2020, the UK will leave without one and go on to World Trade Organisation rules.

But critics said such a move would be the equivalent of a ""no deal"" Brexit and would damage the UK economy.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove has also said the government could walk away from talks as early as June if a ""broad outline"" of a deal has not been agreed.

Asked if that position could change due to the threat of coronavirus outbreak causing delays, the PM's spokesman said the transition period would still end this year, adding: ""In UK law, a request for an extension is not possible.""

'Level playing field'

The draft legal text, called the ""New Partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom"", was drawn up by the European Commission.

The document includes a lot of blank sections and placeholders.

But it also makes a number of proposals, including:

A joint partnership council with 16 subcommittees, including one dedicated to the so-called ""level playing field""

Level playing field proposals on competition, taxation, labour and social protection, and the environment

Long term agreements over access to British waters for EU boats, with annual negotiations

Co-operation on data exchange and extradition, if the UK continues to implement the European Convention on Human Rights

The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the text ""shows [an] ambitious and comprehensive future relationship is possible"", adding: ""We must give ourselves every chance of success.""

But the UK government has already said it would not accept any alignment with EU laws as they are updated.

It has also rejected the EU's call for ""level playing field"" guarantees - where British companies would be given tariff-free access to the EU market if they do not undercut their rivals within the bloc.

However, the EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards.

The British negotiating team will take a red pen to large sections of this EU draft treaty.

They reject the idea of the deal referring to specific European laws.

They don't want the words ""European Court of Justice"" to appear anywhere.

And the proposal on fishing will be seen as limiting the UK's control of its own waters.

It will be worth scrutinising the text carefully, as there are lots of more technical areas of agreement that could form the basis of an eventual deal.

However, the two sides disagree on whether there should one big blockbuster deal or several smaller ones - and that's an argument that's potentially unsolvable.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51871155,BBC,Politics,True
"['Gavin Stamp', 'Political Reporter', 'Bbc News']",Coronavirus: Business as usual for self-isolating MPs,"Image copyright AFP Image caption James Brokenshire is among ministers working from home

Parliament may still be open for business but the coronavirus crisis is rapidly changing life for MPs.

Although only one has so far tested positive - the health minister Nadine Dorries - an increasing number are choosing to self-isolate after either feeling unwell or learning that colleagues they have recently mingled with now have the virus.

New government advice recommends that people isolate if they develop symptoms themselves.

Security Minister James Brokenshire is working from home ""as a precaution"" for a week after attending a breakfast meeting in the United States with Australian counterpart Peter Dutton, who has since tested positive.

Edward Argar has insisted there has been no-let up in his vital work as a health minister despite voluntarily confining himself to his home, saying ""the red boxes are still coming"".

Conservative MP Dehenna Davison said she was secluding herself in line with the latest NHS guidance that anyone with a high temperature or a persistent cough should stay away from work for a week.

Posting a picture on Twitter of her laptop, diary and a packet of solpadeine, the Bishop Auckland MP said she was working remotely and in ""regular contact"" with her team, adding ""it's business as usual but just a bit more digital"".

Hundreds of MPs, whether they have shown any symptoms or not, are starting to grapple with how to continue to represent their constituents while scaling back their public engagements - potentially for a prolonged period.

Many, as a first step, have decided to postpone face-to-face constituency surgeries, which typically take place on a Friday and Saturday.

These are, arguably, the most important date in an MP's weekly diary - an opportunity for constituents to raise problems and talk confidentially.

Image copyright EPA Image caption MPs are using different platforms to keep in touch with their constituents

Ms Davison said postponing all face-to-face meetings was the ""responsible thing to do"" in the current climate.

Others have followed suit, including Bournemouth East MP Tobias Ellwood, who said he had made the ""profound"" decision to stop seeing constituents and also not to visit his elderly mother, who was recently discharged from hospital.

Although drop-in events are now off limits for many MPs, they are making clear that their constituents can still reach them by phone. Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, said he and his staff will ""continue to operate as normally as possible within the issued guidelines"".

Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, has been in self-isolation for several days but is continuing to deal with local casework over the phone as well as fulfilling her duties as the party's spokeswoman for employment rights.

""It is about making sure we function and keep up our support for people,"" she told the BBC. ""The issues that people have with benefits and housing are not going away.""

'Visibility'

The MP, who is currently in London, has not ruled out holding face-to-face meetings after she returns to her constituency. But she expects to ""remodel"" her working practices, doing more via Skype and other platforms.

""The whole thing about the visibility of MPs - that will change and we will play more of co-ordinating role. We must make sure we are de-escalating this, staying ahead of the curve, and putting in place procedures which will be resilient through the peak of the crisis.""

Labour's Lilian Greenwood and Alex Sobel became the first MPs to take action last month, after they attended a Westminster conference where one of the guests tested positive for Covid-19.

Neither of them developed symptoms and they both returned to work.

With events changing by the minute, MPs are having to make very careful judgements and, according to Rachael Maskell, ""there have been a lot of discussions on WhatsApp groups about the different decisions"" being taken.

Conservative David Johnston, the MP for Wantage, is contacting everyone booked in for his weekend surgery to see if they want to go ahead while his Banbury colleague Victoria Prentis is speaking to elderly and more vulnerable constituents.

Analysis

By Daniel Kraemer, BBC Political Research Unit

One of the priorities for the government in the next few weeks will be to pass emergency legislation to respond to the public health crisis.

To do this - without triggering emergency powers - Parliament must be open but it doesn't have to be fully attended.

Parliament needs to be ""quorate"" before it votes and make progress on legislation.

This means there need to be at least 40 MPs present. In the Lords, the number is 30.

And it doesn't matter how many for each party are there. So, theoretically, the government could make progress with just 11% of Conservative members in the House.

The Labour Party has repeatedly called for changes to be made to the law to allow people being affected by the coronavirus crisis to have access to statutory sick pay.

This is something that is expected to be contained in government legislation, which ministers say will be published in the coming week.

And a row has broken out on Twitter between Ms Dorries and the wife of Conservative colleague Andrew Bridgen, who is self-isolating after developing a cough.

Nevena Bridgen has suggested the minister, who has praised the work of Public Health England, did not tell its contact tracers that she sat next to her husband in the Commons tea room before her diagnosis. This, she claims, has put her own baby and elderly mother at risk.

,Woman says Alex Salmond kissed her after doing zombie impression,"Image copyright PA Media

An SNP party worker has claimed Alex Salmond did an impression of a zombie before kissing her on both cheeks then trying to kiss her on the mouth.

The witness, known as Woman J, said the alleged incident - shortly before the independence referendum - had been ""like an awful nightmare"".

She also alleged that Mr Salmond later asked if she wanted to ""stay over"" at his Bute House residence.

Mr Salmond denies sexually assaulting Woman J in September 2014.

He has also pled not guilty to a further 13 charges of sexual assault against nine other women.

The alleged offences are all said to have happened when Mr Salmond was serving as Scotland's first minister and the leader of the SNP.

Woman J told the High Court in Edinburgh that she had been working with Mr Salmond in Bute House when she left the room to go to the toilet.

When she returned, she claimed to have ""utterly froze"" after finding Mr Salmond ""lying on the ground, between the dining table and the back of the sofa.""

She alleged that Mr Salmond had a pen and paper next to him, and told her to ""come here and work on this speech"".

Woman J said she lay on the ground some distance from Mr Salmond because she did not want to anger him.

The witness alleged that they were both working on the speech when ""out of the blue"" he asked: ""Have you seen that zombie movie?""

She claimed that Mr Salmond told her to stand up before he ""stretched his arms out straight towards me and did an impression of a zombie walking towards me"".

She added: ""He put his arms on my shoulders and leaned in to kiss me on one cheek and then proceeded to move me out of the way to kiss my other cheek.

""Then he leaned in to kiss me on the lips.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Woman J said the incident took place at Bute House

Woman J said she raised her arms to break his connection on her shoulders, and had attempted to act like nothing had happened.

But she alleged that Mr Salmond had later touched her briefly on the leg and face.

And she claimed he had said she could ""stay over"" if she wanted to - to which she had thought there was ""no way in hell I was"".

Under cross-examination from defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC, Woman J agreed that Mr Salmond was a ""touchy feely, tactile person"" who had sometimes kissed members of the public, and that she had thought that this was inappropriate.

Ms McCall put it to the witness: ""This incident with the zombie film, he says that never happened. You're going to tell me it did?""

Woman J replied: ""Yes"".

She also agreed that she had continued to work with Mr Salmond after the alleged incident.

Image copyright Jeff J Mitchell Image caption Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC described Mr Salmond as a ""tactile person""

Earlier in the day's evidence, a former civil servant known as Woman K claimed that photographs were taken of her as Mr Salmond grabbed hold of her bottom.

She said the photographs were taken at an event at Stirling Castle shortly before Mr Salmond stood down as first minister in November 2014.

Woman K claimed that Mr Salmond had been ""very insistent"" that she have her photograph taken with him.

She alleged that, as they were standing in front of the photographer, Mr Salmond put his arm around her before he ""reached down and grabbed hold of my backside"".

Woman K said Mr Salmond had done this ""quite forcefully with his full hand"" and it had felt ""very deliberate"".

She said she had felt ""shock and disbelief"" but had tried to ""just keep smiling"".

She said: ""I just want to do my job and feel proud of myself doing my job and it felt like I was being demeaned.

""It was unprofessional but there was nothing I could do about it.""

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Gordon Jackson QC suggested that the alleged incident involving Woman K was not sexual

The court was shown a series of photographs of the woman with Mr Salmond.

She appeared to have her eyes shut in several of them, and to be looking at Mr Salmond in another.

Woman K told the court that she looked ""very embarrassed"" because of ""what had just happened"".

She said another photograph shown to the court showed a ""look of disbelief"" on her face.

The witness said she had no choice but to get on with her job, but the next day she told her manager what had happened ""to make sure he was aware"".

What has the trial heard so far?

Woman K later agreed with defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC when he put it to her that she had thought the alleged incident ""wasn't sexual, it was about power"".

She said: ""That was my interpretation. The first minister grabbed by backside because he could.""

She also agreed that she had once described Mr Salmond as ""genuinely concerned and nice"" when she became unwell at work.

And she agreed that she had phoned Mr Salmond the next day to thank him for helping her.

Woman K also said that she had already contacted the Scottish government before it set up a helpline for people to report any allegations of inappropriate behaviour.

But she agreed that at that stage she wanted the complaint to go through the government rather than the police.

Dozed off

A third complainer, a Scottish government civil servant known as Woman D, told the court that it was a ""fairly regular occurrence"" for Mr Salmond to put his hands on her bottom when they were walking together, and that he had touched her face, hair and arms.

She said it made her feel uncomfortable, but she had put up with it because ""he was the leader of the country"" and she was worried it would damage her career if she put in a complaint.

Woman D went on to claim that she had once dozed off while in a car with Mr Salmond during a foreign trip - and had felt ""shocked"" and ""pretty icky"" when she woke up to find him stroking her face.

And she alleged that Mr Salmond had reached out to touch her face in a lift, before a colleague knocked his hand away and said something like ""What do you think you are doing?""

Defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC asked Woman D if she had once shown Mr Salmond a holiday picture of herself in a ""somewhat skimpy bikini"".

When she replied that she had only done so because Mr Salmond had asked to see her holiday photos, Mr Jackson replied: ""I take it you don't just take bikini photos? Why show him that one?""

Woman D replied: ""I don't know.""

Mr Salmond says he is innocent of all the allegations against him.

He has entered not guilty pleas to all 14 of the charges against him, which include one charge of attempted rape, one of sexual assault with intent to rape, 10 sexual assaults and two indecent assaults.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-51870445,BBC,Politics,True

""Shouting and snarling"" is not the way to get judges to accept curbs to their powers, a former top judge has warned.

Lord Sumption said the judiciary was likely to accept ""reasonable"" measures to address government concerns they are meddling in politics.

But he said the government would be mistaken if it thought ""abuse"" was the way to ""get things done"".

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a review into the relationship between government and the courts.

The commission will be overseen by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, working alongside Justice Secretary Robert Buckland and Attorney General Suella Braverman. Lord Sumption is reportedly being tipped by officials to be its chairman.

Ministers believe questions need to be asked to ""clarify what it is a judicial review is for"", senior government sources say.

Some ministers have argued that judicial reviews should not be used as a substitute for the work of Parliament.

But they have said any reforms will not be ""revenge"" for controversial decisions over Brexit - instead saying it will be about making the system better.

The prime minster's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is also keen on limiting judicial review powers.

In 2015, he argued on his personal blog that ""major reform"" was needed but it was an ""extremely fraught"" and complex issue, and entangled with Human Rights law and how the civil service ""uses all this to enmesh ministers in management chaos to stop things they don't like"".

What are judicial reviews?

A type of court case that allows members of the public to challenge the legality of a government decision

It can be a decision by a government department, a regulator, a local council and certain other public bodies

Judicial reviews can not overturn entire Acts of Parliament passed by MPs

Decisions can be challenged on the grounds that a minister did not have the power to make it, or the process leading up to it was unfair or irrational

A decision can also be overturned if a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with the Human Rights Act

Most cases do not get very far - in 2018 only 218 made it as far as a court hearing, out of 3,597 that were lodged

Of the cases that reached court, the government won 50% of them

Some members of the judiciary fear the government is seeking revenge for the Supreme Court's ruling in September that the government acted illegally in seeking to prorogue Parliament ahead of October's Brexit deadline.

More recently, ministers were left fuming when the Court of Appeal ruled against the removal of 25 foreign offenders scheduled to be on a deportation flight.

Lord Sumption, who was a Supreme Court justice between 2012 and 2018, has said he does not accept that the court overstepped the mark in September's prorogation judgement - or in a 2017 ruling forcing the government to hold a vote on triggering Article 50.

But he argued that courts were too often failing to distinguish between the legality of a minister's decision and ""cases where the judge simply does not like the underlying policy"". He said this was a particularly concern in immigration and benefit cases.

'Proper forum'

In a BBC Parliament lecture at King's College London, he said: ""We are only a democracy because ministers are answerable for the formation and execution of policy to Parliament.

""Parliament may not always be as effective as it should be. But the House of Commons is the only institutional means by which the electorate can influence policy.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Gina Miller spearheaded two successful challenges to government policy

""The appropriation by the courts of the right to decide where the public interest lies cuts across demarcation lines which are fundamental to the democratic state.

""Parliament is the proper forum for political opposition to the government. The courts are not.""

The former judge also argued that any shake-up of Britain's constitution must include electoral reform arguing that the first-past-the-post system produced governments without broad support.

'Unnecessary hostility'

He also argued that some international treaties, such as the European Human Rights Convention, lacked democratic legitimacy.

He said there was ""every prospect that judicial cooperation will be forthcoming if the measures proposed are reasonable and directed only to the more overtly political manifestations of judicial activism"".

But he warned that any attempt to reform the judiciary - or any other institution with wide public support - would fail if the government was too confrontational in its approach.

""People tend to judge politicians by their tone as much as their substance. Abuse is not a useful tool of policy. Shouting and snarling provokes unnecessary hostility among the electorate which will ultimately doom the whole project.""

,Coronavirus: Government insists schools should stay open,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption There are real worries over the impact the virus will have on learning

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said keeping schools open in England is the ""best course of action"", despite fears about the coronavirus.

It comes as blanket school closures are being announced in European nations such as Spain, France and Ireland.

He told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that sending all pupils home would put a big strain on key workers who would also have to stay at home.

School leaders agreed keeping schools open was the right decision.

Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which is meeting for its annual conference, said head teachers would authorise absence if parents took the decision to keep their children off lessons.

'Exams worry'

He anticipated absences would be small in scale and similar to ""snow days"".

The government has said individual schools may be advised to shut by Public Health England if necessary.

Mr Barton said there was pressure from parents for more information and guidance about what might happen to national exams.

The exam season starts in early May, when the virus outbreak is expected to reach its peak, but exam regulators are urging schools to prepare for public exams as normal.

GCSE exams start in the second week of May and run until mid-June.

Mr Barton said many head teachers were facing questions about the exam season, and there was an urgent need for reassurance.

""Parents and pupils are worried about being the victim of something out of their control and are asking, 'Will I get into college or university?'""

Mr Williamson said: ""We're doing everything we can to make sure it's fair for students, we're having regular discussions with Ofqual.""

The government warned on Thursday that within weeks, whole households would be asked to self-isolate if one person showed symptoms consistent with coronavirus.

It is not clear exactly what this would mean for a teenager unable to sit their exams, but there are mechanisms for allocating marks in exceptional circumstances, which have been used before.

The Welsh government has been advised that school closures are not an appropriate move at the moment, though the situation remains under review.

The Scottish government has also said school closures would not be an effective measure at this stage.

The Republic of Ireland's decision to close schools, colleges and public childcare facilities until 29 March is likely to affect businesses in Northern Ireland's border region that employ staff from the Irish Republic.

In the meantime, many schools will continue to assess how technology could be used to continue pupils' learning in the event of isolated closures.

Sharon Bruton, chief executive of the Keys Federation Academy Trust in Wigan, whose schools use an artificial-intelligence learning platform, said teachers could set assignments via email and social media accounts.

""Schools are adaptable and flexible places - I'm certain school leaders and curriculum leaders will be thinking about how teaching can continue for their students should this be an eventuality,"" she said.

""Educators are remarkably resilient and adaptable and I think part of our job is to meet the needs of our children and make sure they can thrive in challenging circumstances - and this [coronavirus outbreak] won't be any different.""

So the possibility of blanket school closures has been kicked down the road, but that doesn't remove the uncertainty entirely.

No head teacher can rule out the possibility their school could be affected at some point. More pressing is the likelihood that the peak in cases could coincide with exams due to begin in mid-May.

This might mean more households isolating, more teachers off work.

One option could be to move some exams to later in June, when fewer are traditionally scheduled to take place.

This would prolong the agony for teenagers, and their families, but could increase the chances of most being able to sit the exams that are the passport to the next stage of their life.

In the meantime, despite expert advice, some parents continue to call for school closures.

The exams watchdogs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all urging teachers and students to prepare for the exams season as normal.

In Scotland, where exams start earlier than the rest of the UK, the Scottish Qualifications Authority said there was no change to the 2020 national-qualifications timetable.

""Current deadlines for coursework, and other assessments, remain in place,"" it added.

England's exams watchdog, Ofqual, said: ""We continue to work closely with exam boards, other regulators and the Department for Education and we have met to plan for a range of scenarios, as the public would expect.

""Our overriding priorities are fairness to students this summer and keeping disruption to a minimum.""

Qualifications Wales said: ""We will provide guidance on our website to reflect any specific arrangements that schools and colleges should put in place if required.""

Northern Ireland's Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) said there were ""a broad range of contingencies to ensure the smooth operation of examinations"", which would be updated if necessary.

""In the meantime, students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer examinations and assessments as usual,"" it added.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51835486,BBC,Politics,True
,RHI: 'Corruption did not cause' energy scheme failure,"Image copyright Charles McQuillan Image caption The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating

Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme.

The findings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme were published on Friday.

It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"".

The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating.

The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"".

Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost.

Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.

It became known as ""cash for ash"".

Arlene Foster 'sorry for failings'

The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster.

Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster

She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"".

Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"".

""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn Féin MLA said.

Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly.

The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself.

""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption RHI behaviour was 'unacceptable'

However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information.

The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford.

It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"".

The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism.

The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin

A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"".

The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"".

The lack of record keeping was also highlighted.

It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants.

""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said.

""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place.""

What was the RHI scandal?

The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers.

But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.

It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget.

The financial scandal led to the collapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017 and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020.

A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it.

No expertise or support

Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"".

""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced.

""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported.""

A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014.

In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed.

The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better.

Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption The report said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour from Spads""

Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked.

The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"".

It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members.

Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party.

Inadequate governance

The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted.

The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"".

The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on.

This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"".

Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"".

""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme.

""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-51840287,BBC,Politics,True

,Smart motorways plan aims to boost safety,"Image copyright Gov.uk

The government says it wants to ""raise the bar"" on smart motorway safety, following criticism of the scheme.

Under the plan, opening motorway hard shoulders for traffic in busy periods will be scrapped.

On those smart motorways where the hard shoulder has been removed entirely, there will be an increase in places for vehicles to stop in an emergency.

Between 2015 and 2018, 11 people a year on average have died on smart motorways in England.

Announcing the plan to improve smart motorway safety, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had been ""greatly concerned by a number of deaths on smart motorways, and moved by the accounts of families who've lost loved ones in these tragic incidents"".

""The overall evidence shows that in most ways smart motorways are as safe or safer than conventional ones - but they are not in every way,"" he said.

A Freedom of Information (FoI) request sent by the BBC's Panorama to Highways England revealed that in one section of the M25, outside London, the number of near misses had risen 20-fold since the hard shoulder was removed in April 2014.

In the five years before the road was converted into a smart motorway, there were just 72 near misses. In the five years after, there were 1,485.

Jim O'Sullivan, the chief executive of Highways England, said: ""Every death in any road accident is tragic, and we are determined to do all we can to make our roads as safe as possible.""

There are two types of smart motorway in the UK.

The first is where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic when it is busy. The second is where the hard shoulder is open all the time and drivers who break down are encouraged to pull into emergency stops.

In addition to abolishing the ""confusing"" dynamic hard shoulder, the government has said it will also reduce the distance between places to stop in an emergency to three quarters of a mile where possible.

It says this will mean on future schemes, motorists should typically reach a stop every 45 seconds at 60mph. The maximum spacing will be one mile.

The government's plan also includes measures to:

Installing 10 additional emergency areas on the existing M25 smart motorway section

Speeding up the deployment of technology to detect 'stopped vehicles'

Making emergency areas more visible

Introducing more traffic signs giving the distance to the next place to stop in an emergency

Committing £5m to a communications campaign to increase awareness of how smart motorways work

Mr Shapps acknowledged the changes would cost ""quite a lot of money"", adding it could reach ""hundreds of millions of pounds"".

""Nothing is more important to me than making sure our road networks are completely safe,"" he said.

Meera Naran, whose son died on a smart motorway, welcomed the changes saying: ""I feel like this is a small mother's day present from Dev wherever he is.""

RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said it was welcome that the government had listened to drivers' concerns but added ""it remains to be seen if these measures go far enough to protect drivers"".

While the AA's Edmund King said the changes were ""a victory for common sense and road safety"".

But Labour MP Sarah Champion said the proposals did not ""go far enough"" and called on the government to restore smart motorways ""to traditional operation"".

She accused Mr Shapps of ""allowing these lethal roads to continue to operate"".

Image copyright Meera Naran Image caption Eight-year-old Dev Naran (left) was killed on a smart motorway when he was on his way home from visiting his critical ill brother (right).

Smart motorways were introduced with the aim of increasing capacity and easing congestion by using the hard shoulder as an extra lane.

But they have been criticised by the government minister who originally approved the roll-out in 2010.

Speaking to Panorama in January, Sir Mike Penning, who is no longer a minister, said he had been misled about the risks of taking away the hard shoulder.

The Conservative MP said he had agreed to the expansion in 2010 after a successful pilot on the M42 near Birmingham.

The pilot worked well because there were safe stopping points for motorists, called emergency safety refuges, on average every 600 metres.

But when the scheme was expanded across the country, the safety refuges were placed further apart - on some sections, they are 2.5 miles apart.

""They are endangering people's lives,"" said Sir Mike. ""There are people that are being killed and seriously injured on these roads, and it should never have happened.""

Responding to his comments, Highways England said the plans to expand smart motorways were approved by ministers and that it was working to gather the facts about safety.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51851421,BBC,Politics,True
,Budget virus plan 'substantial' but 'limited',"Image copyright EPA

The Budget measures to tackle the coronavirus are substantial, but limited, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).

The IFS gave its assessment the day after the chancellor announced a £12bn package to mitigate the economic effects of the virus.

It also warned that working from home would be harder for factory workers than for those in office jobs.

And many self-employed people would still not be entitled to sick pay.

""Mr Sunak will certainly want to monitor the effectiveness of the package and be ready to come back with more if necessary,"" the IFS said.

""This is a substantial package, well targeted at what it is seeking to achieve. It is, though, necessarily limited,"" it said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his first Budget to the Commons on Wednesday

""On the business side, it is aimed particularly at those businesses which might face a demand shock - those in hospitality, retail and so on.

""It does much less for those that might end up having to reduce production or close temporarily because staff can't come into work, either because they are ill, self-isolating or looking after children who have been sent home from school.""

'Very weak' forecasts

The IFS also described the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecasts for the UK economy as ""very weak"", even before factoring in long-term effects from the coronavirus.

GDP growth is the percentage change of how fast an economy is growing or shrinking over time.

The OBR said the growth rate was expected to dip to 1.1% this year, before picking back up to 1.8% in 2021.

The IFS called these projections ""feeble"" and said that the economy was ""not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus"".

Robert Chote, the OBR's chairman, said on Wednesday that given the severity of the outbreak, risks that the forecasts might need to be downgraded further were ""all too clear"", although the threat was difficult to quantify.

'Right economic thing to do'

Large rises in public spending also mean that general government spending will contribute more than half of GDP growth this year and the next.

Image caption The coronavirus is leading to shortages of hygiene items

The increased spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

Borrowing more money to invest into the UK is ""the right economic thing to do"", the chancellor has said.

Rishi Sunak told the BBC that interest rates were at a ""multi-decade low"" and he was ""not going to make an apology"" for the Budget - which included a £30bn package of investment.

The Bank of England announced a cut in interest rates on Wednesday.

But the Resolution Foundation warned of a £575 a year blow to households, even before the impact of coronavirus.

The think tank said the mark down of the UK economy by the Office of Budget Responsibility, without taking the outbreak into account, was ""incredibly grim and yet still unbelievably optimistic"".

Its chief executive, Torsten Bell, said: ""In reality, once we take the economic impact of coronavirus into account, this is the weakest official growth outlook on record.""

Labour's John McDonnell told the BBC's Today programme he welcomed more investment from the government, but ""10 years of austerity brought the country to our knees"" and the Budget was ""only going part way to making up"" for Tory cuts.

The chancellor said the plans he laid out on Wednesday were a ""significant step change"" for the government and the amount it would invest in infrastructure.

As well as a £5bn emergency response fund for the NHS and a number of other measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, he announced spending of more than £600bn on roads, rail, housing and broadband across the next five years.

But questioned over the OBR's low growth forecasts in the short term, Mr Sunak said the organisation had praised the government's long-term investment plans.

""We can look at that as see we are on the right track with the plans we are doing, and it will start to have an immediate effect on people,"" he told Today.

'Unprecedented'

Former Prime Minister Theresa May urged ""restraint and caution"" on spending after the Budget announcement.

She told the Commons: ""Although spending a lot of money may be popular and may seem the natural thing to do, there is, of course, that necessity to have a realistic assessment of the longer term impact of those decisions and of the longer term consequences.

""It is also necessary to ensure that we have that restraint and caution that enables us to make the public finances continue to be strong into the future.""

Mr Sunak defended his plans, saying he would be sticking to the fiscal rules set out in his the Tory's election manifesto.

""But we are going to take advantage of these historically and unprecedented very low interest rates to invest in the long-term productivity of our economy,"" he said.

""That is, I think, the right economic thing to do, whilst overall having stable management of our debt.""

Mr Sunak added: ""I am not going to make an apology for responding at scale in a comprehensive fashion to the immediate challenges we face from coronavirus. I do think that is the right thing to do.""

This is a new government with a new chancellor much hungrier for spending, much hungrier for borrowing and much less bothered about the size of the national debt - and we are talking about very, very big numbers here.

The case the government makes is: it is coherent and correct to do this as it is dead cheap for governments to borrow in the long term.

Rishi Sunak believes that what started off as a temporary, extraordinary period of low interest rates is basically now locked in for the long term.

It is the economic and political fashion now to think it is going to be a long-term situation, therefore if borrowing is so cheap, why wouldn't you want to be more flash with the cash?

But with respect to the economists, sometimes their crystal balls are a bit wonky, things can change, and some Conservatives on the backbenches believe this may not be the time to run up a new, additional, huge overdraft.

However, the government's judgement is 'now is the time' - not least because they want to be able to keep the very many promises they have made to electorate.

Easy budgets are ones where you stand up and write big cheques. But sometimes they pave the way for much harder budgets in the years to come.

The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

,Grooming gang research petition to be considered for Parliamentary debate,"Image copyright Getty Images

More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the release of Home Office research into the ""characteristics"" of grooming gangs.

The government has refused to release the information, telling The Independent it was ""not in the public interest"" to do so.

The issue will now be considered for a debate in Parliament, having passed the required number of signatures.

The Home Office said work on the issue was ""ongoing"".

In 2018, the then Home Secretary Sajid Javid ordered research into the ""characteristics and contexts"" of gangs abusing children, arguing that ignoring issues such as ethnicity is more likely to fuel the far-right.

He said he wanted officials researching the causes of gang-based exploitation to leave ""no stone unturned"".

The review came after grooming gangs were convicted in Huddersfield, Oxford, and Rotherham.

But the Independent reported last month that the government was refusing to release the research, saying it was not in the ""public interest"" in response to the publication's Freedom of Information request.

The petition, on the UK government and Parliament petitions website, reads: ""We, the British public, demand the release of the official research on grooming gangs undertaken by the government in full.

,Pavement parking could be banned in England,"Image copyright Getty Images

Parking on pavements could be banned in England to help pedestrians, the Department for Transport has said.

With the exception of London - where a ban already exists - only lorries are currently prevented from pavement parking.

The government is to open a consultation on whether to give local authorities more parking powers.

The AA, however, has warned a ban could have ""unintended consequences"" and cause more widespread ""parking chaos"".

The consultation comes after a committee of MPs last year called for a nationwide ban on the ""blight"" of parking on pavements.

Witnesses told the Commons' transport committee that the worst cases of pavement parking were effectively trapping disabled, elderly and vulnerable people, making them ""afraid to leave their homes"".

The cross-party group said blocked-off walkways were also exacerbating the issue of loneliness in Britain.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Vehicles parked on the pavement can cause very real difficulties for many pedestrians.""

He said the consultation would look at a variety of options, including giving local authorities extended powers to crack down on this behaviour.

Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the transport committee, welcomed the consultation, noting that the government had promised in 2015 to look into the issue but consultations and reviews had failed to improve roadside conditions.

""This government has signalled an intent to finally deliver change,"" he said, adding that detailed timings were needed.

London's ban

While ministers consider outlawing pavement parking across England, a ban has been in place in London since 1974.

One of its main aims is to prevent pedestrians, including wheelchair users, people with baby buggies and the visually impaired, from being obstructed.

But it is also about limiting damage to footways - unlike roads, pavements are not designed to take the weight of vehicles.

The rules apply to almost all streets in London at all times, and those who flout them can be given a parking ticket of up to £100 and be towed away - even if just one or two wheels are parked on the footway.

Exceptions to the ban include vehicles that have been exempted by councils and for unloading or loading when there is no other method available.

It is a widespread issue - a YouGov survey in 2018 found 65% of drivers admitted to having previously parked on the pavement.

'Unintended consequences'

The AA said it agreed that people who park in an anti-social way should be penalised.

But it added: ""An outright ban could lead to unintended consequences with parking chaos becoming more widespread.

""A better solution would be for councils to make a street-by-street assessment and where pavement parking could be allowed it be clearly marked and signed.""

Last year, Scotland became the first country in the UK to legislate against pavement parking. The ban comes into place in 2021.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51844446,BBC,Politics,True
"['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Desk Editor']",Apps 'must check images for child abuse before publication',"Image copyright Getty Images

Internet companies must do more to tackle ""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuse on their platforms, a UK-held inquiry has concluded.

The panel also said the technology companies had ""failed to demonstrate"" they were fully aware of the number of under-13s using their services and lacked a plan to combat the problem.

It has called for all images to be screened before publication.

And it said more stringent age checks were also required.

'Reputational damage'

Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were identified as the most commonly cited apps where grooming was said to take place.

And the industry at large was accused of being ""reactive rather than proactive"" in response to the issues.

""Action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children,"" the inquiry said.

The report follows a series of public hearings, between January 2018 and May 2019, during which the police said they believed the UK was the world's third biggest consumer of live-streamed child sex abuse.

'Evil crime'

Facebook was one of the first to respond.

""[We] have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions,"" said its European head of safety, David Miles.

""As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe.""

Microsoft also promised to ""consider these findings carefully"", while Google said it would keep working with others to ""tackle this evil crime"".

Illegal imagery

The report said some steps should be taken before the end of September.

Leading its list is a requirement for screening before images appear online.

The report noted technologies such as Microsoft's PhotoDNA had made it possible for pictures to be quickly checked against databases of known illegal imagery without humans needing to look at them.

But at present, this filtering process typically happened after the material had already become available for others to see.

Officially banned

Users might be frustrated by a delay in seeing their content go live but, the panel said, it had not been told of any technical reason this process could not happen before publication.

The inquiry also said the UK government should introduce legislation to compel the companies involved to adopt more effective checks to deter under-age users.

Pre-teens were at ""particularly acute"" risk of being groomed, it said.

The panel recognised many services were officially banned to under-13s.

Child nudity

But it said in many cases, the only test was to require users to fill in a date-of-birth form, which could easily be falsified.

""There must be better means of ensuring compliance,"" it said.

The report acknowledged detecting and preventing the live-streaming of abuse was difficult but highlighted a French app as an example to learn from.

It said Yubo used algorithms to detect possible instances of child nudity, which a human moderator would then check to see if action if necessary.

Image copyright Yubo Image caption It was suggested the big social networks could learn from a smaller rival, Yubo

The panel also noted existing anti-abuse technologies did not work when communications were protected by end-to-end encryption, which digitally scrambles communications without giving platform providers a key.

The inquiry highlighted WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage and FaceTime already used the technique by default and Facebook intended to deploy it more widely soon.

However, it did not say how this should be addressed.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51851921,BBC,Politics,True
,Coronavirus: Plaid Cymru call for Wales v Scotland to be called off,"Image copyright Stu Forster/Getty Images Image caption Scotland v Wales at Murrayfield in last year's Six Nations

The Six Nations match between Wales and Scotland should be called off, Plaid Cymru has said.

Leader Adam Price called for all mass gathering events should be postponed or cancelled.

The safety of citizens ""must be put before everything else"", Mr Price said.

But Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said advice cancelling events would not make a difference in saving lives.

However he said a recommendation the Scottish Government has made, that large events should not go ahead from next week, is also being considered in Wales.

Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said that, from Friday, people with symptoms of a new cough or fever would be asked to self-isolate for seven days as part of an escalated response to the coronavirus.

Plaid earlier cancelled its own spring party conference, due to be held on 20-21 March in Llangollen.

Welsh Labour and the Liberal Democrats also announced they have cancelled their conferences.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has recommended that mass events involving more than 500 people should not go ahead from next week.

Mark Reckless, Brexit Party group leader in the assembly, called for all schools in Wales to be closed from Monday.

""I recognise the disruption this will cause, but I believe social distancing should begin sooner rather than later, and that doing so now may make a significant difference to the rate of infection and save lives,"" he said.

Adam Price said: ""The safety of our citizens - including the most vulnerable and at risk of coronavirus, must be put before everything else.""

He called for the Welsh Government to take ""urgent and aggressive action"" rather ""than waiting for instruction from London"".

They should consider instructing public sector workers to work from home, whether schools should break up early for Easter, the party leader said.

""All mass gatherings and events should be postponed or cancelled with immediate effect - that would mean no indoor gatherings larger than 100 and no outdoor gathering larger than 500.""

Earlier Plaid Cymru said cancelling its conference ""is the most responsible course of action for the party to take in the current circumstances.""

Conservative assembly member Andrew RT Davies said postponing the Wales-Scotland match was ""surely the sensible move"".

Image caption Vaughan Gething said opposition parties should take a ""responsible approach""

In a robust response, Mr Gething told a press conference that politicians, including those in the opposition, should take a ""responsible approach"" and should not try to suggest ""there is public health advice to take a step when actually it does not exist"".

""The challenge about larger events is that the science doesn't tell us it really makes a difference either in significantly delaying the peak of the outbreak or indeed in terms of saving life.""

However, he said that the Scottish Government view on larger events may be taken by Welsh Government. ""That is something we are actively considering. And we may make the same decision next week as well.""

He said the Scottish Government was thinking about the impact on emergency services.

'Think carefully'

The Labour event was to be held from 27 to 29 March.

Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""At a time when the whole Welsh Labour Government is focused on responding to the major challenge of coronavirus, I have decided it would not be right for members of the Welsh Government to be taken away from those duties.

""I look forward to the conference being rescheduled.

""The Welsh Government is not at present suggesting cancellation of other events in Wales but do advise everyone to think carefully if they represent the best use of time and resources in the current context.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-51853674,BBC,Politics,True
,Budget 2020: Chancellor pumps billions into economy to combat coronavirus,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the “largest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 years”

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a £30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak.

He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding.

In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together.""

The Bank of England has announced an emergency cut in interest rates.

Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus.

""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs.

Of the £30bn in extra spending, £12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least £5bn for the NHS in England and £7bn for business and workers across the UK.

This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to £18bn next year, and even more in following years.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around £100bn to public borrowing by 2024.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, which has now been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts.

Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include:

Statutory sick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate"" even if they have not displayed symptoms

Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below £51,000 suspended for a year

A £500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas

A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to £1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses

The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus

Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts

Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres

The number of coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus.

The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"".

The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving £6bn over the next five years.

The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

Big increases in borrowing

The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts.

And that figure does not include £12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak.

The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn.

In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year.

A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled and duties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more.

The so-called tampon tax will be abolished, and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journals will be scrapped from 1 December.

And the chancellor pledged to more than double spending on UK government research and development by 2024.

The chancellor announced more than £600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projects over five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England.

He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"".

He also promised an additional £640m for the Scottish government, £360m for the Welsh government, £210m for the Northern Ireland executive and £240m for new city and growth deals.

Mr Sunak said he was providing £200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences.

The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January.

,Budget 2020: McDonnell criticises government for offering 'nothing on social care',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McDonnell: I'm absolutely worried about social care

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the government's Budget has offered ""nothing"" to tackle the ""social care crisis"".

He told the BBC it would be difficult to ""rebuild"" social care services to cope with the coronavirus outbreak.

He said he was ""worried"" about the future, but he welcomed extra funding to help the NHS.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social care will get ""everything it needs"" to respond to the outbreak.

Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced at least £5bn this year for the NHS in England to help it cope with the spread of the virus.

Mr Hancock told MPs the extra cash was for ""social care too"", telling MPs that adult social care ""will be at the front line of our response"".

It comes after Mr Hancock wrote to MPs last week to start cross-party talks to find a long-term solution on how social care should be funded.

The talks were a pledge in the Conservative election manifesto, which also promised an extra £1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years.

According to NHS Digital, 841,850 people were receiving long-term care in England in 2018. An ageing population is expected to increase demand.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Neil Show, Mr McDonnell said he would support any ""effective"" plan to emerge from the talks.

But he accused ministers of having failed to ""seriously"" acknowledge pressures faced by the sector, and failing to ""learn the lessons"" from budget cuts to public services over the last 10 years.

""There's nothing for social care today,"" he added, referring to the Budget.

""If you don't tackle the social care crisis, we're going to have real problems - not just immediately but for the long-term future"".

Earlier, former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted he failed to solve issues relating to social care whilst in office.

Writing on Twitter, he added that the sector ""desperately"" needed a long-term plan to go alongside the 10-year NHS England blueprint unveiled last year.

""Hospitals will continue to fill up, and the winter crisis will be annual until we fix this issue,"" he added.

'Astounding omission'

Speaking after the Budget was delivered, acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the spending plans did not do ""anything"" for social care.

""We have a care sector on its knees. Care homes are closing and there are shortages of care staff,"" he said.

""It is an astounding omission.""

Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund think tank, said adult social care remained a ""pressing and overlooked"" issue.

He added that it was ""hugely disappointing"" the Budget ""does not include an emergency cash injection to help local government to address social care needs beyond coronavirus.""

Social care is a devolved issue. In Scotland, the SNP has said if it is re-elected in 2021 it would scrap all non-residential social care charges.

Plaid Cymru has said social care in Wales should be free at the point of need and funded from general taxation.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51844778,BBC,Politics,True

,Coronavirus: Five ways hospitals will change to tackle the pandemic,"Image copyright Getty Images

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has braced the UK for ""quite extraordinary interventions that you don't normally have in peacetime"" to combat the coronavirus pandemic. But what are these interventions and how will they change the NHS?

1. Hotel room or hospital ward?

Image copyright Steve Parsons/PA Wire Image caption A Holiday Inn hotel near Heathrow Airport has been reserved by the government for people arriving from abroad to self-isolate

The health secretary said empty hotels across the country would help ease the pressure on hospitals that are filling up with patients.

""Some people are saying: 'Should you build a hospital?'"" Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

""Actually, we've seen that many hotels are empty so we've got ready-built facilities for looking after people.""

Asked about whether military field hospitals might also be used to spread the load, Mr Hancock said: ""I'm open to all options.""

He said he was more concerned that enough staff members and equipment were available to cope with an influx in patients, rather than worrying about where those patients would go to receive care.

""The critical thing is that [the hotels] need oxygen supply and the ventilation equipment - whether it's the invasive ventilation or just the mask on your face.

""So what matters is not just the space, it's making sure that the equipment and the trained staff are there as well.""

Hotel chain Best Western said it was considering turning some of its properties into temporary hospitals to help the NHS.

Chief executive Rob Paterson said Best Western would discuss the idea this week and ""would be willing to take unprecedented steps to support the national effort"".

The chain reported an increase in cancellations over the last month as a result of the pandemic.

2. NHS or private hospital?

The Labour Party and the GMB union have called on the government to use empty beds in ""plush private hospitals"" to ease the pressure on the NHS.

Downing Street confirmed on Sunday that the health service would buy up thousands of beds in private hospitals if they were needed to cope with a surge in patient numbers.

The government said ""negotiations"" with private healthcare providers have already begun.

But the GMB union is calling for these beds to be given to the NHS for free.

""This is a public health emergency, not a business opportunity for shoddy private healthcare chums to profiteer from distress,"" said GMB's Rehana Azam.

3. Ventilators made at car factories

How will thousands of new ventilators - machines needed to help patients breathe - be made quickly enough to cope with an increase in demand?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available in the UK at the moment but that many times that number would be needed as the number of people with Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, increased.

Asked if the likes of military engineers and car manufacturers would be asked to meet the demand, the health secretary said: ""Yes, we're talking to all those companies.""

""We've got high quality engineering in this country. And we want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators to do that,"" he added.

The speedy manufacturing might not stop once the UK has enough ventilators either, with Mr Hancock suggesting the equipment could be sent abroad to help other countries in need.

Digger manufacturing company JCB confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if they could help to make ventilators.

Chairman Lord Bamford said the British company - which cut production and working hours in February as coronavirus led to a shortage of components - would do ""whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing"".

Skip Twitter post by @JCBmachines Following reports in today’s media, JCB Chairman Lord Bamford said:

4. Operating theatres converted into wards

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Non-urgent operations such as knee or hip replacements will be cancelled to free up space for Covid-19 patients

The cancellation of swathes of non-urgent - or ""elective"" - surgery will help to free up space, Mr Hancock said.

He said the sorts of operations that could be delayed ""in this emergency"" situation included hip and knee operations.

Operating theatres where these procedures are normally carried out are equipped with oxygen supplies, meaning they ""can be turned into wards"" for coronavirus patients.

This measure is ""one of the first things that we're going to do"", he added.

5. New (and old) staff

Image copyright Jeff Overs/BBC Image caption Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Andrew Marr how hospitals would change as the UK waged war on the virus

All those extra ventilators will throw up another problem - there are not enough trained nurses and doctors to operate them.

To fix this, Mr Hancock said the government wanted to bring recently-retired doctors ""back into service"".

But, the health secretary said, some of those workers would need to be trained up to deal with the specific needs of Covid-19 - which is a respiratory disease,

""We will be stopping some other activity, and asking doctors who normally do other things to retrain to be able to, for instance, use the ventilators.""

He would not say how long it might take to train people up but did say: ""We will do it as fast as we can.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51898207,BBC,Politics,True

"['Marco Silva', 'In-Depth Reporting On Social Media']",General election 2019: What's the evidence that Russia interfered?,"A leak of confidential UK government documents in the run-up to last December's general election has been blamed on Russian actors. But what evidence is there to say the Russian government itself tried to interfere in British politics?

With just about two weeks to go before election day, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn revealed a trove of confidential documents outlining talks between UK and US officials about a possible future trade deal.

The leak fuelled a debate about the future of the NHS and made the headlines for days, particularly after evidence emerged blaming Russians for the leak.

But a key question remains unanswered, three months after the vote: Was the Russian government directly involved?

Reddit and the elusive 'Gregoratior'

The 451-page trove of documents first emerged online in October.

A user going by the name ""Gregoratior"" posted a link to the documents on discussion website Reddit, suggesting the publication would ""make some noise"".

It didn't at first: only a small number of Reddit users noticed the post and commented on it.

On Twitter, politicians and journalists also failed to immediately notice the leak, despite repeated attempts by a Twitter account, again with the handle ""Gregoratior"", to get their attention. Since then, the account has been suspended.

Listen to our investigation 'Did Russia leak British secrets online?'

With less than a week to go before the election, Reddit released a statement linking the ""Gregoratior"" account to a known disinformation campaign coming out of Russia.

The website banned the account, along with 60 other related accounts suspected of misusing the platform and engaging in what they called ""influence operations"".

We asked Reddit if we could examine the evidence the company holds linking these accounts to Russian operators - but they declined to show us.

It also remains unclear how the Labour Party got hold of the leaked documents. At the time, they did not reveal their source, and they did not respond to BBC Trending's recent requests for comment.

At the time of the leak, Mr Corbyn described suggestions that Labour might have benefited from a Russian operation as ""nonsense"".

'Operation Secondary Infektion'

But there is stronger evidence pointing to the involvement of Russian hackers - albeit not conclusive proof that the Kremlin itself is involved.

Last year, Facebook shut down dozens of accounts, pages and groups run from Russia for engaging in what the company described as ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"".

They were linked to what the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank, would later identify as ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" - a disinformation campaign stemming from Russia.

Through a network of bogus social media accounts, this campaign tried to spread forged documents and false news stories that, according to DFRLab, ""attacked Western interests and unity"".

Image copyright FunnyJunk.com Image caption Among the forged stories were suggestions that Spanish intelligence was aware of a Remainer plot to kill Boris Johnson

Often translated into several languages, many of these stories were published on websites open to contributions from the public.

When the leak of UK-US trade documents hit the headlines, open-source investigators noticed how the files were published and distributed online. Soon, the similarities with ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" became evident.

""The tradecraft was absolutely identical,"" says Ben Nimmo, who worked on the original DFRLab report and is currently head of investigations at US company Graphika.

Nimmo outlined the similarities between the earlier operation and the UK leaks in a report released in December.

""The same type of pages were being used, similar username strategies were being used,"" says Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""It either is an actor who is replicating these efforts or it is the same actor.""

Image copyright Reddit Image caption Another forged story which was part of the operation suggested the Real IRA had posted an Arabic-language invitation to Islamist fighters online

There was however one key difference: while ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" spread false stories based on forged documents - often clear and preposterous fakes - the ""Gregoratior"" leak of trade talk documents seems authentic.

The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, but no government official has yet denounced them as forgeries.

""The big question is still: How did internal UK government documents end up on Reddit in the first place?"" says Mr Nimmo.

Due to the possibility that hackers may have been involved in gaining access to the documents, the National Cyber Security Centre is currently investigating.

Moscow denies involvement in leaks

While the evidence points back to Russian territory, it is far more difficult to determine who specifically was carrying out the operation and, more importantly, on whose orders.

""It was sophisticated, it was well resourced,"" says Mr Nimmo. ""The likeliest candidate is either some form of Russian state operator or some proxy of the Russian state operators."" But he and several other experts stop short of drawing a definitive line to the Russian government.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference

""Yes, Russia does have that strategy in their playbook,"" Ms Neudert says. ""But it could also be private actors, some sort of hacker collective, it could be some sort of tech-savvy trolling... There are many kinds of actors that are hacking private information.""

The Russian Embassy in London denied any links to either ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" or the leak of UK-US trade documents.

Other experts warned that an exclusive focus on Russia could deflect attention from other campaigns.

""Russia has a habit of trying to interfere in western countries' elections,"" says Elisabeth Braw, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. ""They are extremely good at corrupting our public discourse.""

""But we have a situation where it's very easy to blame Russia,"" Ms Braw says. ""That is extremely dangerous, because we neglect to examine the activities of other countries that want to weaken our societies, such as China, North Korea, or Iran.""

Unreleased report

In October, the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee completed a report outlining the various ways in which Russia has recently tried to interfere with British democracy.

Downing Street delayed the publication of the report, prompting accusations that it might be trying to suppress its key conclusions. Number 10 denies the accusation and says a normal timetable has been followed.

Publication is now expected later this year, once a new Intelligence and Security Committee has been appointed.

"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']",Coronavirus: What next in the UK coronavirus fight?,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

['Press Trust Of India'],"No timeline to remove income tax exemptions, says Nirmala Sitharaman","Finance Minister on Sunday said the idea behind introducing second alternative tax slabs sans exemptions was to take the country towards “a simplified, exemption-free, and reduced rate of tax regime”.

There was, however, no time frame set by the government to remove all exemptions, she told reporters after an interactive session with trade representatives and intellectuals on the Union Budget.

“At the moment we only started a second alternative with some exemptions removed or some exemptions included, although the original intention was to remove all exemptions and give a clear simplified reduced rate of income tax,” the finance minister said.

The Budget has introduced more tax slabs and offers higher limits provided the taxpayer is ready to forego all the existing exemptions and deductions including home loan interest, other tax savings investments. “We have not made up our minds as yet (on the removal of all exemptions)... We are trying step by step, move forward and no particular timeline given,” she said.

Addressing a post-Budget press meet on February 1, Sitharaman had said the government intended to remove all I-T exemptions in the long run.

On Sunday, she said based on a simulation and assumption, 69 per cent of taxpayers would have benefitted and probably 11 per cent would have been “attracted” had the new tax regime been introduced last year.

When asked about the Supreme Court order on telecom companies’ payment of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and the concerns expressed by some bankers, Sitharaman said it may not be proper for her to comment on the matter as there is a Ministry concerned looking into it. “The concerned ministry is looking into it. So, it may not be proper for me to comment on it,” the minister said.

To a query on allegations by the Telangana government that there was a decline in devolution of funds to states from the Centre, she said the allocation is followed as per the recommendations of the Finance commissions and it is not true that the centre is not cooperating with states.

‘FRBM not breached’



The finance minister said the Budget was prepared keeping the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) in mind even as she maintained she would be remembered for presenting the “longest prepared Budget” than for “longest speech” on it.

“So in a way all these (measures) and more have been done that the FRBM, as an Act, we have to keep in mind and also comply with it. So we have not really breached the FRBM. We have not gone outlandish on it. We have kept fiscal discipline, which is a USP for both the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and also for the Shri Narendra Modi government,” she said.

The Centre had earlier said it was committed to reducing fiscal deficit — the gap between total expenditure and revenue — to 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2020-21 and eliminate the primary deficit as per the FRBM Act.

The government has utilised ‘escape clause’ under the FRBM Act, which allows the Centre to breach its fiscal deficit target by 0.5 percentage points at times of severe stress in the economy, including periods of structural change and when growth falls sharply.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/no-timeline-to-remove-income-tax-exemptions-says-nirmala-sitharaman-120021600696_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True
['Press Trust Of India'],"Budget disappointing; but fiscal, taxation measures welcome: EAC member","The Union Budget was ""disappointing"" as it lacked a vision, though measures like relaxing the fiscal deficit target and simplifying income tax are positives, the PM's economic advisory council member Ashima Goyal has said.

Goyal, who is a part-time member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), also said that it was a ""surprise"" not to have a mention of the word 'slowdown' in the nearly three-hour long speech by Finance Minister

The budget document is a ""balancing act"" between fiscal stimulus to drive growth and the need to be responsible on spending, she said at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research here over the weekend.

""Overall it (Budget) was disappointing because they didn't bring out the vision as a first real budget of a new government. It had to give a vision,"" the eminent economist said.

India's GDP growth is expected to slip to a decadal low of 5 per cent this fiscal, pressured by domestic factors like drop in consumption, as well as global issues.

""Surprising thing is that coming at a time when everybody is disturbed about a slowdown, the word slowdown is not used at all in almost three-hour long speech. There was no discussion on how the Budget is going to attack slowdown,"" Goyal said.

She further said Sitharaman was in a ""catch-22"" situation from the word go in the Budget making process, wherein any action would have left someone unhappy.

However, the finance minister has achieved a ""balancing act"" through her moves, Goyal said.

She elaborated that by adopting the 'exit clause' under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, the government gave a stimulus to growth and yet affirmed commitment to rules against fiscal profligacy.

To drive the point further, she said a 0.5 percentage point relaxation in fiscal deficit target offered under the exit clause makes lot of resources available, considering that the overall size of the economy is nearly USD 3 trillion.

Goyal also welcomed the government's resolve not to adopt policies similar to the response following the 2008 financial crisis.

She said in 2008-09, the fiscal deficit had gone up by 4 percentage points and the interest rates were also taken to record lows to stimulate growth.

There is also an attempt by the government to direct expenditure more towards capital expenditure, which suggests that the quality of the fiscal deficit is better now.

The Budget also has other positives like the ones on taxation, where there is greater focus on trust and simplification, she said, welcoming the debated moves on exemptions.

The government's moves on frontloading expenditure to early part of the fiscal year will also help, she said.

The measures on helping smaller non-bank lenders will prop up the economy as liquidity is still an issue for lot of players in the system, she noted.

The government has been ""opportunistic"" on the transparency front, she said, adding that credibility has been added by stating the off-budget borrowings through entities like the Food Corporation of India.

On banks' reluctance to pass on RBI's rate cuts, she cited pressure from both the elevated small savings interest rates and also the dependence of a large population on interest income.

""We are not willing as an economy to move to a lower interest rate, lower inflation economy,"" she said.

On the resource mobilisation front, she acknowledged that people are getting ""cynical"" with the privatisation targets after a massive under-performance on this front in FY20, but seemed to suggest that work already undertaken, like in the case of Air India, will reap revenues.

Meanwhile, she also flagged implementation issues on the budgetary targets, suggesting that the revenue increase targets are very high.

Goyal also pitched for a relook at the the subsidy model, highlighting food subsidies to illustrate that the consumption habits have changed.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/budget-was-disappointing-for-lacking-vision-but-fiscal-taxation-measures-welcome-eac-pm-member-ashima-goyal-120021600334_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

Garg, in a blogpost titled 'Will Expenditure Proposals of Budget 2020-21 Stimulate Growth and Improve Redistribution?', said that in the broadest sense, the expenditure proposals of Budget 2020-21 present more of consolidation in the face of deteriorating economic and fiscal situation.

""The objective of kick-starting growth and building growth momentum which does not seem to have been addressed effectively in the Budget. Infrastructure investments in roads, railways and metros have been the major planks of infrastructure investment by the government.

""The outlays of these programmes have not seen any nominal growth in 2020-21 (in real terms, these would be 8-10 per cent lower),"" the former finance secretary said.

He said that likewise, outlays for promoting industrial and services growth have seen no change in character.

""All these expenditures are unlikely to be imparting any fresh growth stimulus to the Indian economy,"" he argued.

A number of good public welfare programme like rural roads, rural housing, toilets, household electricity connections, LPG connections and now tap water are continuing with their much-needed outlays protected, Garg said, adding that distress relieving programme like MGNREGA and PM-Kisan are also continuing with their outlays preserved.

""This equity will go down under without it ever coming back to the Government. It makes no sense for BSNL and MTNL to go for 4G licence and create a network at this stage in a super competitive field.

""If the Government intended to keep these two companies mortally sick but on ventilator, more transparent way would have been to pay this as grant and not as capital expenditure,"" he said.

['Indivjal Dhasmana'],"Open to tweaking Budget to address concerns of the industry, says FM","did not rule out tweaking provisions of the Budget to address concerns of the industry.

She also said her ministry is willing to take more steps beyond the Budget announcements to boost the economy.

“As and when tweaking will have to happen in the Budget or as and when more has to be done beyond the Budget, we are willing,” she said in her interaction with sector experts on Friday.

The also said that the ministry will come out with detailed rules on its direct tax resolution scheme in a couple of days. This will provide clarity to those who are keen to settle their tax disputes under the scheme.

Changes to the Budget are made when the Finance Bill comes up for discussion which will happen after Parliament reconvenes post the recess next month.

Industry sought clarity on taxes on real estate investment trusts (REITs), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), dividend tax, employees stock options (ESOPs) and real estate, among others.

The amended direct tax resolution or Vivad Se Vishwas Bill is yet to be tabled in Parliament and then enacted. As such, the rules under the Bill would not be in the form of a notification, Sitharaman said.

She said the details will give a clear picture to what the notification will contain once the Bill is passed by Parliament.

“In a day or two, we will be coming out with a clear non-paper (on the scheme) because Parliament is yet to pass it,” she said.

She told consultants from Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers, among others, that they will have time to look at these and tell their clients what will come out. “You will get 30 days or three weeks before the Bill is passed,” the told the consultants.

Recently, the Cabinet okayed expanding the scope of the Bill called Vivad Se Vishwas to make it more attractive. The ambit will include litigation pending in arbitration forums and debt recovery tribunals (DRTs). The scheme will also include cases related to revision and small-value search disputes.

The Cabinet also sweetened the scheme by reducing the disputed amount by half for those assessees who got favourable orders, but the income tax department challenged those.

Sitharaman has already introduced the Bill in the Lok Sabha to resolve disputed tax cases, amounting to Rs 9.3 trillion, giving effect to the Budget announcement.

The scheme offers waiver of interest, penalty, and prosecution for settling tax disputes. It was earlier limited to cases pending before the commissioner (appeals), the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, high courts or the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2020. Now, a complete waiver of interest and penalty will be given if tax dues are paid by March 31. An additional 10 per cent of the disputed amount will have to be paid after that. To queries on employees stock option provisions in the Budget for start-ups, the finance minister said she is willing to know the opinion of the industry whether to treat ESOPs as salary or perk and how it should be taxed.

['Virendra Singh Rawat'],Yogi govt to table Budget 2020-21 on February 18; session starts Thursday,"The Budget Session of legislature will begin on Thursday with the Yogi Adityanath government slated to table the UP Annual Budget 2020-21 on February 18.

In the backdrop of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) facing poll reverses in the recently held Delhi assembly polls, the budget session will be a stormy affair with the opposition likely to corner the Adityanath government on various issues, including law and order.

Although, the UP Annual Budget 2019-20 tabled on February 7, 2019 was to the tune of Rs 4.79 trillion, the total size of the state budget for the current financial year burgeoned to about Rs 4.96 trillion after the tabling of two supplementary budgets in the legislature on July 23 and December 17, 2019 of Rs 13,595 crore and Rs 4,210 crore respectively.

As such, the size of the UP Annual Budget 2020-21 is expected to breach the historic mark of Rs 5 trillion, when it is tabled next week.

The government is working on various ongoing and proposed expressway projects viz. Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway and Ganga Expressway, apart from other infrastructure projects, such as Jewar International Airport, Greater Noida and UP Defence Corridor. Therefore, the Budget is likely to allocate funds towards these flagship projects, since they are aimed at attaining full or part operational status before the next UP elections in 2022.

Meanwhile, the Adityanath government today held an all party meeting seeking the support of all the political parties in the smooth conduct of the two houses of the UP legislature viz. Vidhan Sabha (Lower House) and Vidhan Parishad (Upper House).

However, the opposition, including Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress will nevertheless attack the BJP dispensation on the people’s issues of alleged farm distress, deteriorating law and order, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic development etc.

Besides, the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) are seen as the fulcrum around which the opposition will take the government to task, and indirectly target the Narendra Modi government at the Centre.

Meanwhile, it would be the first time when UP Governor Anandiben Patel will preside over the Annual Budget Session after taking over the gubernatorial post last year from her predecessor Ram Naik.

In the second Supplementary Budget for 2019-20 tabled in December 2019, the Adityanath government had allocated Rs 1,700 crore to the industries department for the various infrastructure projects. Rs 960 crore was given to the UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) for the prepayment of loan HUDCO loan sourced for Purvanchal Expressway.

Sources said while the American Club Cool Fresh Taste saw the minimum hike of 10 per cent, from Rs 200 to Rs 220 for a pack of 20 cigarettes, the price of Navy Cut Filter rose by about 16 per cent, at Rs 80 for a pack of 10 sticks. Flake Filter has become costlier by 14 per cent at Rs 80, while prices of Flake Special Filter, Flake Blue Special Filter and Wave Cool Mint rose by 20 per cent.

Other brands that suffered a price rise were Gold Flake Super Star and Duke Special Filter.

Incidentally, it is one of the steepest price upsurges took in the past 2-3 years. Last year, the firm increased the prices of Bristol, Capstan and Flake Excel by 7-14 per cent and also introduced hikes in some regional brands while in 2017, prices rose by 6-7 per cent across brands.

However, in 2016, the company took selective price increases across its cigarettes portfolio pass on the excise increase, making Classic and Gold Flake Kings brands more expensive by 13 per cent. In the year before prices went up by 12-21 per cent.

The hike this time exceeded the previously anticipated surge of 7-10 per cent which sector analysts were expecting after NCCD was revised.

Analysts reasoned that on a blended basis, there is likely to be an 11 per cent tax hike on the average as the dominant 64 mm (mini king size) has seen a sharper tax hike of 15 per cent while others like the king size and regular sizes have seen tax hike of 9-10 per cent.

According to Abneesh Roy, executive vice president of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities, a seven per cent hike would have led to a 3-4 per cent decline in volumes.

The previous projection, however, is likely to be revised now.

ITC, which commands the leadership position in the cigarettes space with a 3/4th market share, has been raising concerns over the stress on its cigarettes business prompted by taxation and illicit trade.

After its third quarter results, ITC said that while the company continues to augment its product portfolio, “extremely stringent regulations along with a punitive and discriminatory taxation regime on cigarettes in recent years have had numerous negative, albeit unintended repercussions”.

It said that such a course has resulted in decline in legal volumes in favour of lightly taxed and tax-evaded tobacco products. Moreover, the absence of mandatory pictorial warnings on illegally traded cigarettes in the country has also added to the stress on the legal cigarette industry.

ITC also raised concerns that there has been widespread availability of illegal cigarettes and other tobacco products of dubious quality and hygiene to consumers at extremely affordable prices.

After its results for the third quarter of the current fiscal year, ITC said that the performance during the quarter reflects the persistent weakness in the overall demand environment, especially in rural markets and wholesale channel, tight market liquidity conditions and the increasing salience of illicit trade especially at the premium end.

During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, ITC posted a 6.31 per cent rise in its income from cigarettes, at Rs 17,928.69 crore, while profit from cigarette sales rose by 7.59 per cent to Rs 12,188.58 crore.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/itc-is-first-to-hike-cigarette-prices-post-budget-makes-them-10-20-dearer-120021101540_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

“The economy is strong, foreign exchange reserves are at its highest, and investments from abroad continue steadily,” Sitharaman said while interacting with economists, traders, and industry associations at an event in Chennai.

“We are sound in macroeconomics. Even though there are discussions on whether the economic growth has come down to 5 (per cent) or 6 (per cent) from 8 per cent, our base is as strong as it was when there was 8 per cent growth. If not, will foreign exchange reserves be at the current level? They are higher than ever. Similarly, foreign direct investment is the highest ever. If it (the government’s work) is being criticised with a good intend to improve performance, it is good. We will return to 8 per cent growth,” she said.

She said people who blamed Prime Minister for growth falling from 8 per cent to 5 per cent should consider that industries were coming to India like never before. “When international markets are fluctuating, and and the US-China trade war are impacting the markets, if one Budget has been able to maintain all the three markets at good levels, it is the government’s Budget,” she said.

She was referring to the performance of the equity, bond and currency markets since the Budget presentation on February 1. She said the government had responsibly used public funds, unlike the previous Congress-led governments that gave bank loans to “uncles and brothers-in-law” when the economy was slowing down in 2008-2010.

Sitharaman said goods and services tax (GST) collections were growing as the government was taking help of improved technology and plugging the loopholes. She said during the past three months, GST collections had exceeded Rs 1 trillion.

Ajay Bhushan Pandey, revenue secretary, said new individual income-tax proposals would help taxpayers in many ways. He said the Vivad se Viswas scheme was expected to get passed by Parliament this month and an electronic interface would be introduced where taxpayers could find out the details of their dispute and apply instantly for a settlement.

Foreign exchange earnings in tourism sector has grown from Rs 1.75 trillion to Rs 1.88 trillion between January and November 2019. Factoring in the encouraging FDI inflows and outbound Indian tourist splurge on foreign travel, tourism promotion deserved a higher allocation, the industry body felt.

“We had already brought to the notice of the Union finance ministry that Rs 9,000 crore is being spent by Indians traveling abroad on holidays because India is lacking infrastructure required for the tourism sector. More good hotels at iconic destinations and domestic tourist locations are not available within the country and do not have sufficient hotels. It was proposed to give incentives up to three-star category hotels to enable Indian hospitality sector to compete with neighbouring countries to make tourism a major foreign exchange earning source for the country,” said J K Mohanty, secretary, HAI and chairman (eastern region), Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO).

HAI welcomed the Budgetary announcement of developing five archaeological sites at Rakhigarhi in Haryana, Hastinapur in Uttar Pradesh, Sivasagar in Assam, Dholavira in Gujarat and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu, stating that iconic sites with on-site museums will definitely help the tourism sector. However, it lamented the omission of sites of historical and religious import in Odisha such as Sun Temple at Konark, Jagannath Temple at Puri and Dhauli, the seat of Buddhist peace pagoda on Bhubaneswar's periphery.

Flagging the positives in the Budget for the tourism sector, HAI lauded the Government's decision to pledge Rs 100 trillion for infrastructure and creating a national infrastructure pipeline by improving railways, airports, national highways, train connectivity to iconic tourist destinations improving water ways by connecting rivers and building 100 more airports to support UDAN scheme.

The that for several months remained in the comfort zone of the central bank has started inching up and crossed the 7 per cent mark during December 2019, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables.

Experts said the MPC members are going to have a tough time as slowing economy makes the case for reduction in repo rate, while rising inflation and higher fiscal deficit will require the central bank to either hike the rate or maintain a status quo.

The sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2019-20 will be announced at 1145 hours on Thursday.

['Somesh Jha'],Budget 2020 has not accounted for telcos' AGR dues: DEA secretary,"In the Union Budget, the government hasn’t included the (AGR) dues, which the Supreme Court has ordered telecom service providers to pay, in its revenues for 2019-20 and 2020-21.

While upholding the AGR definition of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), SC had in October 2019 asked telcos to pay up past dues estimated at Rs 1.47 trillion within three months. The industry plea, seeking a modification of the order to get more time for paying up the dues, is yet to be heard in the top court.

“The AGR dues have not been factored in by the government in its Union Budget as the matter is sub-judice,” said economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty on the sidelines of the post-Budget-Ficci event on Monday. He said the AGR dues have not been accounted for either in the current financial year or the next. “We want to be on the conservative side while budgeting our revenues,” he added.

In the latest Budget, the government has estimated a revenue of Rs 1.33 trillion from telecom services in 2020-21. This is around Rs 74,000 crore more than the Rs 58,989 crore it expects to earn in the present financial year.

The government hasn’t specified the avenues from which Rs 1.33 trillion can be realised in the telecom sector.

It is either an ambitious target or the government would look for alternative resources, said analysts.

Besides AGR dues, spectrum auction across bands, scheduled for this year, would yield revenues. However, the financially stressed telecom companies are unlikely to bid aggressively in the auction.

Even after the SC deadline for paying up the AGR dues expired on January 23, the DoT did not take any coercive action against the defaulters as their appeals seeking relaxation in payment timelines is pending in the apex court.

The figure of Rs 1.33 trillion under the telecom head in the Budget raised apprehensions among telecom operators that they may have to pay a substantial portion of the AGR dues — over 50 per cent of Rs 1.47 trillion — in the next fiscal year.

According to Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) estimates, telcos have to pay around Rs 16,000 to Rs 17,000 crore as licence fee and spectrum usage charge (SUC) this year.

Even after assuming that revenues will grow sharply due to increase in tariffs and redefinition of AGR, they say it cannot be more than Rs 30,000 crore for FY21. But with a moratorium of two years on payment of deferred spectrum for FY21, which is Rs 25,000 crore, this money will not be available. Also with negative response on 5G, COAI expects the government to get Rs 25,000 crore upfront for fresh spectrum auction next year.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-2020-has-not-accounted-for-telcos-agr-dues-dea-secretary-120020301781_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

They indicated that spectrum auction component may have been included in the receipts although the same could not be confirmed.

The government on Saturday increased the revenue estimate from the debt-ridden telecom sector by over two-folds to Rs 1.33 trillion for 2020-21. The government, in the receipt budget, has pegged a revenue collection of Rs 1,33,027.2 crore for financial year 2020-21 under communications head.

It expects a revenue of Rs 58,686.64 crore under communications head in the current fiscal year against budgeted amount of Rs 50,519.8 crore in 2019-20.

The Supreme Court, in October last year, had upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual (AGR) of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

"['Shreya Jai', 'Amritha Pillay']",Power industry hails proposal for smart prepaid metering across the country,"The proposal for smart prepaid metering across the country in three years, announced in the Union Budget last week, has been hailed by the power industry. But the initiative is not new. The power ministry has been planning it for the past two years, but with limited success. At the same time, many hurdles await the ambitious plan.

In her Budget speech on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman said, “The ministry intends to promote smart metering. I urge all states and Union territories to replace conventional energy meters with prepaid smart meters in the next three years,” she said on Saturday.

Two years back, R K Singh, Union Minister for Power, said his ministry was planning to convert all meters in the country to smart prepaid meters. In an interview to Business Standard in 2018, Singh had said he would mandate state-owned power distribution companies (discoms) to switch to smart prepaid meters.

“Smart, because we are aiming at ‘time of the day’ tariff. Prepaid, because it improves bill collection and efficiency. It is pro-poor as well. Consumers can charge as many times as they wish. They will not face disconnection. It is good for discoms as they will get payment in advance,” he had said then.

Since then, 400,000 smart meters have been installed to date in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. These were by Energy Efficiency Services, which is mandated for smart meters tendering to private companies. Close to 5 million were tendered in the first round.

Responding to the announcement in the Budget, the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers Association (IEEMA) said this is a positive step and the industry will fully cooperate with the government in meeting the target.

“Installing smart prepaid meters will improve the cash flows and revenue of discoms. Going by the government’s commitment to promote Make In India, it should also ensure indigenous meter makers are preferred over imported ones. With smart prepaid meters come data and cybersecurity risks. Hence, indigenous products should be given priority,” said Sunil Mishra, director general, IEEMA.

Despite the ambitious target, there is, however, no budgetary allocation or grant to smart metering in the Union Budget.

Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director for Tata Power, called smart metering push a ‘knee-jerk reaction’. “The government needs to first address distribution reforms. Smart meters on their own will not give much benefit,” said Sinha. He further added, once other distribution-related technologies are in place, smart meters will bring in great value.

Several industry players also highlighted that the investment needed under this ambitious plan would come from the private sector and hence, there needs to be a comprehensive policy. “The plan would need close to ~1-1.5 trillion of investment and five-seven years for implementation. There is no guiding policy yet on smart meters,” said an executive of a leading meter company.

He said a common policy should be enforced for all states with rules on payment security, data security, operation and maintenance. “To start with, all state and state electricity regulatory boards should be on board and agree to a unified policy,” he said.

A smart prepaid meter has a modem (communication device) and a remote switch by which demand, supply, and billing can be monitored and controlled remotely. The data from the meter is collected in a cloud server. This reduces energy theft, improves billing and bill collection. It also helps discoms collect the data of consumer demand patterns, which, in turn, can be used to plan supply.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/power-industry-hails-proposal-for-smart-prepaid-metering-across-the-country-120020301438_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

An evaluation of 13,000 using the CRISIL Quantix database shows that working capital comprises over half of their need for debt.

In this context, the push given to the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform — the institutional mechanism that facilitates financing of MSMEs’ receivables — is a positive, too.

The extension of loan restructuring for another year (till March 2021) is also expected to provide relief to a sector that accounts for about 9 per cent of the banking system’s gross non-performing assets.

""We are not saying which one is beneficial, which one is not beneficial. We have provided an option. We have not put restrictions on anyone. This proposal can only benefit somebody and not harm anybody,"" he said. ""So, in this whole proposal, not a single person will be loser.""



He said taxpayers have an option to stay with the current regime of getting a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 and investing Rs 1.5 lakh in saving schemes and pay 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 30 per cent tax depending on income levels.

Alternatively, they can migrate to the new regime and pay lower tax rates without having to invest in any instrument to claim exemption, he said.

In the new regime, 5 per cent tax is levied on an annual income between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 per cent. The tax rate rises to 10 per cent, 15, per cent, 20 per cent and 25 per cent for every Rs 2.5 lakh addition. A 30 per cent tax is charged for income over Rs 15 lakh.

""Because the proposal is that we will continue the old scheme and if you find the new scheme attractive, you come or else you don't come. Therefore, there is no scope of confusion or worry,"" he said.

Pandey said the taxpayer will have to choose between old and the new regime at the time of filing return for the next financial year, sometime in July 2021.

""When you file I-T return, there will be a choice. If you say choice 1 then the return form in the new system will open and most of your application will be pre-filled. Then, you make appropriate changes and file I-T (return). If you choose the old system, then only that form will open. It is easier to pre-fill the form under new tax structures,"" he said.

He said data show that out of the 5.8 crore individuals who filed returns in the financial year 2018-19, 90 per cent claimed tax deductions of less than Rs 2 lakh, including deductions under Section 80C of the Act (for provident fund, PPF, life insurance premium), Section 80D (mediclaim insurance), Section 80CCD(1B) (additional deduction for National Pension Scheme), deduction for housing loan interest and standard deduction.

""I am not saying it (new scheme) will benefit everyone. It might benefit 30-40 per cent people. But, even if it is benefiting 30 per cent people then also it is a big thing,"" he said. ""We are giving option to those people who are unable to avail exemptions or deductions. Who are these people -- somebody who has just joined job market, someone who has not decided to buy a house, he does not know how much will be savings, he might be putting little money in PF (provident fund) and insurance. He may find that depending on his income, this new scheme is better.""



Similarly, for senior citizens living on a pension and who do not have to buy a house or put money in PF, the new regime would be beneficial, he said.

The new tax regime is also beneficial for small businessmen and shopkeepers who do not get the benefit of LTC or HRA.

""It is not that our objective was to provide benefit to each and every section of the taxpayer. We have provided option and that should be fine,"" he said adding the new tax rates would lead to a Rs 40,000 crore dent in government revenues in the next financial year.

Individuals having an annual salary income of over Rs 13 lakh and availing deductions of up to Rs 2 lakh will save on their tax outgo if they opt for the new tax regime proposed in the Budget, government sources said on Sunday.

For those earning a salary of Rs 12 lakh and less and availing deductions of up to Rs 2 lakh, the old tax system will be beneficial as the tax outgo will be less compared to the proposed new structure.

While individuals with an annual salary income of Rs 13 lakh and above will pay Rs 1.43 lakh tax under the proposed tax structure; in the old regime, they would have paid a tax of Rs 1.48 lakh, thereby saving Rs 5,200, a source said.

On a salary of Rs 14 lakh a year, savings would be Rs 10,400; and for those with an income of Rs 15 lakh and above, savings would be Rs 15,600, provided the deductions claimed are up to Rs 2 lakh.

In the case of non-salary earners, who do not get a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, the new tax structure is beneficial for those earning Rs 9.5 lakh annually and availing deductions up to Rs 1.5 lakh. They would save Rs 5,200 in their annual income tax outgoing.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/new-tax-structure-gives-option-to-save-tax-revenue-secy-120020301181_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

['Press Trust Of India'],"Budget: No tax relief for home buyers stuck in stalled projects, says FPCE","association FPCE on Monday said the Budget has not provided any major tax incentives for flat owners stuck in stalled housing projects as well as prospective customers to revive confidence in the property market.

There was no relief for existing who are stuck in stalled projects and are paying both rent and EMI on their home loans, said Abhay Upadhyay, president of Forum for People's Collective Efforts (FPCE), earlier known as Fight For RERA.

""Real estate sector is yet to reach anywhere near its past high despite all tax sops provided in previous year's Budget. This is partly because tax sops have failed to infuse confidence in the sector and also because many of the tax benefits provided remains on paper only,"" he said.

There was expectations that the Budget would separately provide deduction for principal repayment on home loan, which currently is part of Rs 1.5 lakh allowed under Section 80C, Upadhyay said.

""To infuse confidence in the sector, it was also expected that some tax relief would be provided to those of delayed projects who are paying both EMI and rent. Unfortunately, no such concessions were announced in the which may further delay much needed recovery in the sector,"" he said.

Last year, the Centre had created a Rs 25,000 crore fund for completion of stalled housing projects, comprising of about 4.5 lakh units. FPCE had been demanding creation of Rs 10,000 crore stress fund.

Real estate developers' apex bodies CREDAI and Naredco have also expressed disappointment over the Budget as their demand of one-time restructuring of builders' loan was not met.

However, many realty firms welcomed the government's decision to extend tax incentives provided for increasing demand and supply for affordable housing segment.

""Notable developments in infrastructure, rural logistics, education and healthcare sectors will create opportunities in real estate space. The policy on data centers was a key highlight and will make it a sunrise sector in India. Major announcements for the housing sector were expected, and barring the extension on both the tax holidays and the time period for availing interest deductions in affordable housing, the highlights on Indian realty was relatively mute,"" Cushman & Wakefield country head and MD- India, Anshul Jain said.

RICS South Asia MD Nimish Gupta said the Budget should have created a formal structure around rental housing and encouraged home buying by increasing tax exemption for housing loan repayments.

Among developers, Supertech Chairman R K Arora said the government's decision to extend additional Rs 1.5 lakh deduction for interest paid on affordable housing loan to March 2021 is good for the sector.

Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said: ""Liquidity and availability of finance is the biggest issue confronting the real sector today. In this context, the assurance given by the FM that NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) and HFCs (Housing Finance Companies) will not face any liquidity crunch will help calm nerves for sure.""



Ashiana Housing Joint MD Ankur Gupta said the middle income and affordable housing segment will get a boost.

Chintels MD Prashant Solomon said, ""Affordable housing segment has got a boost with the FM proposing to extend the tax holiday by one more year. However, the Budget leaves much to be desired for the real estate segment.""



Sunny Kataria, VP-Real Estate, OLX India said, ""There were many expectations from the union budget in 2020 for residential real estate. While the government has furthered its commitment to the affordable housing, many issues remain unresolved.""



Bhutani Infra CEO Ashish Bhutani said that the focus on infrastructure and economic growth in the budget will lead to more activity at the commercial segment as the demand for offices will grow.

Gera Developments MD Rohit Gera said, ""The move to provide more money in the hands of the tax payers and elimination of the dividend distribution tax are welcome steps but rationalisation of direct tax structures over the period has not provided the necessary stimulus needed to boost the real estate.

['Kanishka Gupta'],"Not all NRIs need to pay tax, here's what FM clarified post budget speech","The Union has introduced a new personal regime, in an attempt to bring down the tax burden for individual tax payers. However, the changes don’t seem to be in favour of Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who aren’t paying taxes to date.

Finance Minister in her recent Budget speech on February 1, proposed to tax Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who do not pay taxes in any foreign country.

Yes, this statement made NRIs anxious. Especially those working in the Gulf region where countries don't tax their income.

So, finance minister clarified that only Indian income of NRIs is proposed to be taxed under the new provision, and later Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) also put out a clarification saying that ""the new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries"".

Well, if you’re thinking, what made the ministry to come up with such a change? The ministry said it was an anti-abuse provision amid growing instances of NRIs shifting their stay in low or no-tax jurisdiction to avoid tax payment in India.

Here’s what Sitharaman said in a press briefing on Sunday, “An living in another country earns money there, which is not taxed there at all, but has some earnings through something in India and does not pay tax here either because he does not live here. What we are saying is this: for the income generated in India, pay a tax. If you have a property here that generates rental income, but because you live there, you carry this income there and pay tax neither there nor here.”

“Have I got even a sovereign right to take that into my consideration or not? I am not taxing what you earn in Dubai,” she added.

Well, in view of this the CBDT chairperson Pramod Chandra Mody said that the move is ""essentially an anti-abuse provision"". ""Some study showed that people are trying to stay in multiple countries for a period lesser than that would make them a resident,"" he said.

And upon asking if these people are doing so to avoid paying taxes, he said it ""appears"" that tax evasion could be the reason.

""Now, in such cases of Indian citizens who are resorting to this system we are putting a provision that if they are not resident of any tax jurisdiction then they will be treated to be a deemed resident of this country."" ""And by virtue of that, their taxable income or to say their entire global income, will be taxed here,"" Mody said.

This means an NRI, who is not a resident of any country, will now be deemed an Indian resident and their income will be taxed here.

Mody said India now has multilateral tax treaties with other countries where ""we continuously exchange information and hence getting information on such people will not be that difficult"".

What’s more, tightening the residency provisions, the Union has also reduce the period of stay in India from 182 days to...

,Budget stimulus unlikely to revive India's growth from slowdown: Experts,"India's new budget is unlikely to drag Asia's third- biggest economy out of its worst slowdown in more than a decade as the government has proposed only moderate spending increases and small cuts in personal taxes, economists said on Sunday.

They said there was a risk the government might miss its target for 2020-21 as it was dependent on raising almost $30 billion from the sale of stakes in state-run firms and financial institutions to meet ambitious revenue goals.

In its budget for the year starting in April unveiled on Saturday, the government relaxed its target so it could spend an nearly $15 billion more, mainly on infrastructure and farming, while pushing ahead with privatisations.

Economists and industry leaders said the budget proposals would provide some support to growth over the longer term but were insufficient to give it an immediate boost.

India's economy is forecast to grow 5% in the year ending in March, its weakest pace in 11 years, ratcheting up the pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is already facing backlash over a socially divisive citizenship law.

""We see the budget as largely neutral for growth and inflation,"" said Nomura economist Sonal Varma, adding that the financial sector's problems could further delay any recovery. The government has proposed increasing spending to boost consumer demand and investment but it could not go far enough because a slowdown in revenue receipts tied its hands, economists said.

Rating agency Moody's Investor Service said the budget highlighted the fiscal challenges from slower real and nominal growth, which may continue longer than the government expects.

Nomura said annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP)most likely slipped to 4.3% in the last three months of 2019, after dropping to 4.5% the previous quarter, its slowest in more than six years.

Economists said India risked missing its budget deficit target of 3.5% of GDP in 2020-21 as the government's revenue growth target of nearly 10% depends on raising almost 2.1 trillion rupees ($30 billion) from privatisations.

Investors and consumers were also disappointed by the budget as no new incentives were offered for the beleaguered financial sector and housing market while it wasn't clear whether proposed changes to individual taxes would result in net gains.

""The tax cuts won't translate into much benefit for taxpayers,"" said Amit Maheshwari, Partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, a tax consultancy, adding that they could discourage saving and help push market interest rates higher.

SHARES SLIDE

Indian shares slid to their lowest in more than three month in a special trading session on Saturday after the budget was released, dented by what analysts said was a lack of sufficient stimulus measures.

The NSE Nifty 50 index <.NSEI> closed 2.5% lower while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex <.BSESN> fell 2.4%.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Finance minister said investors would soon appreciate the steps taken to boost growth as she had tried to balance fiscal discipline with additional spending, while giving concessions to taxpayers.

The government expects growth to pick up to 6% to 6.5% in 2020-21, helping India move towards its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025 from nearly $2.9 trillion now.

Many taxpayers lamented on social media that the budget was largely ""corporate-friendly"" as it exempted companies from paying tax on dividends, on top of a September cut in corporate tax rates to 22% from over 30% for existing companies.

Receivers of dividends will now be taxed instead, increasing the burden on high-income taxpayers. Sitharaman said the government would issue clarifications on tax cuts soon and may infuse more funds into state-run banks, if needed.

Analysts also said the government's increased dependence on borrowing could crowd out private investments and put upward pressure on government bond yields, offsetting gains from recent monetary policy easing.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut its benchmark repo rate by 135 basis points since last year but debt-ridden banks have not fully passed on the benefits to borrowers.

The RBI's monetary policy committee will next meet on Feb. 6 and the majority of economists expect it to leave rates unchanged following after recent spike in retail inflation, while signalling scope for easing in the future.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-stimulus-unlikely-to-revive-india-s-growth-from-slowdown-experts-120020300087_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True
['Kaushik Mukerjee'],Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget proposals to stimulate economic growth,"Direct taxes

The Union Budget 2020-21 is woven around the themes of Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring Society, together with better governance and growth of the financial sector for betterment of ease of living. The tax proposals are aimed to “stimulate growth, simplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance and reduce litigation”.

Proposals to stimulate growth



Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT)

DDT will be abolished and dividend will henceforth be taxed in shareholders’ hands under the classical system. Indian companies will not pay tax on dividends from domestic companies to the extent of onward distribution of such dividends within a specified period. Mutual funds’ dividends will also be similarly taxed.

The biggest beneficiary of this will be the corporate sector (domestic and foreign) and lower-income non-corporates. Higher-income groups will pay more tax (Table 1). Foreign investors can avail of beneficial tax treaty rates and foreign tax credit (FTC) in their home countries. This measure, coupled with beneficial low corporate tax rates, should enhance capital inflows for industrial development. Reducing the dividend tax for upper tax slab individuals to the DDT level can be considered before enactment. A disparity still remains for domestic companies earning foreign dividends, which needs to be addressed.

Startups

The tax holiday for has been enlarged. with turnover of up to Rs 100 crore (earlier Rs 25 crore) will be eligible and can avail the three-year benefit within the first 10 years (earlier seven years). Startup employees/promoters will not pay tax on stock plan benefits until the earlier of five years from exercise, exit or disposal of shares.

These make the tax benefits more realistic for and should encourage entrepreneurship, especially in the field of technology, contributing to ease of living. Considering the low success rate of startups, a limited concessional capital gains tax can be introduced for exits.

Corporate tax rate

The beneficial tax rate (15 per cent++) introduced earlier in this fiscal year for new manufacturing companies wasn’t explicitly applicable to power generating companies. The benefit is now extended. Going by the nature of the industry, transmission companies can also be granted the benefit.

Co-operative societies: The other beneficial tax rate (22 per cent++) applicable to corporates will apply to co-operative societies also.

These extensions should benefit the Government’s thrust on infrastructure development and help rural development.

Affordable housing: The tax-holiday for developers will now be extended to projects approved upto March 31, 2021. Home-buyers will also get benefit of deduction (of up to Rs 150,000) for loans sanctioned up to March 31, 2021.

Although beneficial, the extension could be for a longer term, to help long-term planning. Considering the state of the real estate sector, removal of notional tax on unsold stock would be further welcomed.

Financial sector: Merged banks will now be allowed to carry forward the unabsorbed tax loss of merging banks. This will help create substantial tax savings for merged banks, which can be pumped into the economy.

Foreign currency borrowing: The sunset clause has been extended up to July 1, 2023 for the 5 per cent TDS rate on interest on foreign currency borrowings, masala bonds, and certain bonds to FIIs, QFIs, and so on.

Simplify tax structure

Personal income tax

An elective provision is introduced with beneficial tax rates for lower-income individuals/HUFs who opt for simpler tax compliance. Such persons cannot avail of deductions/exemptions but will pay tax at lower slab rates (Table 3). The option is to be exercised before filing the tax return, and is yearly for non-business cases while permanent (except for opt-out once) for business persons. Taxpayers can also continue under the older regime of higher tax and more deductions.

Elective tax provisions are now becoming a trend in India. This proposal would not only make tax compliance simpler but also leave additional funds with the taxpayer, which will largely be expended in consumption. This may discourage small investments but should help the economy through growth in demand. Being elective, taxpayers have the option to choose between savings and consumption.

Transfer pricing: The 30 per cent ceiling on interest deduction on loans from related parties will not apply for loans from the Indian branch of a foreign bank.

Taxpayer’s Charter: The Central Board of Direct Taxes will be empowered to declare a Taxpayer’s Charter which will govern the functioning of the tax administration. This is intended to deliver a better experience for taxpayers in their interactions with the tax department. Since this will be legally mandated, the tax administration can be held responsible for the Charter’s application.

Stateless persons: As per the Finance Bill, Indian citizens who are not liable to tax in India on global income and also not liable to tax in any other country due to domicile, residence, etc., will be deemed to be Indian tax residents and subject to tax in India. As per media reports, the government has issued a press release that this will apply only to income earned outside India but derived from an Indian business or profession. Similarly, NRIs visiting India for more than 120 days (earlier 182 days) in a year will be treated as resident.

This will prevent tax avoidance by people managing their affairs in such a way as to avoid tax residence in any country. However, genuine NRIs living/working overseas will not be affected. Such persons should also get treaty protection. The reduction of threshold for visiting NRIs may impact trade in a mobile world.

Catching up with technology in business: Foreign businesses without a physical presence in India will be deemed to have a taxable business presence in India if they have income from (a) advertisements targeting Indian customers, (b) sale of data collected from India using an Indian IP address, and (c) sale of goods/services using such data. Similarly, income of foreign businesses from the sale, distribution or exhibition of cinematographic films will be taxable as royalty.

While the domestic law in this case is amended, this provision may not be implementable until the tax treaties are renegotiated, except where covered under multilateral instruments (MLI).

TDS on e-commerce transactions: E-commerce platform operators will now deduct 1 per cent TDS from payments to Indian residents selling goods/providing services through the platforms.



In respect of both the above type of transactions, it was expected that a digital tax as in the UK and France, among other countries would be introduced. These proposals are probably a precursor to a digital tax.

To reduce taxpayer-administrator interface, electronic facilities will be introduced for penalty and appeal proceedings, and for registration of charitable/religious trusts.

Faceless assessments have just been introduced and the administration has not been tested yet. Expansion could be deferred for seamless introduction after rectifying the initial challenges in e-assessment.

Ease of compliance: Foreign companies having only dividend, royalty or FTS income will not file tax returns if tax is withheld at domestic law rates. Any treaty benefit would require filing. Considering India’s vast treaty network, this may have limited application.

Tax audit: SMEs having turnover of up to Rs 5 crore (earlier Rs 1 crore) will not require a tax audit, provided not more than 5 per cent of receipts/payment is in cash. This is a bait towards a less cash-intensive economy, but can be difficult to prove in practice for the taxpayer.

Fake invoice: Fraudulent claims of GST credit through false invoices will attract penalty under the income tax laws, equivalent to false invoice amounts.

This provision should be a deterrent but needs careful administration to avoid double jeopardy through other penal provisions for unexplained credit.

Pre-filled returns: Audit/ accountant’s reports will be filed one month ahead of the due date of return for enabling pre-filling of data in the tax return. Similarly, deduction of donations will be pre-filled in the tax returns based on an information return to be filed by donees. This would prevent false claim but donees need to key in data correctly.

Reduce litigation

Vivad se vishwas: A one-time scheme to resolve pending disputes has been announced. The framework will be open up to June 30, 2020. Applicants opting before March 31, 2020 will have to settle only tax demanded, and after March 31, 2020 will have to pay an additional amount. The scheme will be notified.

This scheme is a substantial improvement over that introduced in 2016 which waived only a part of the penalty and wasn’t so successful. The ‘Sabka vishwas’ scheme introduced for indirect taxes in 2019, with similar terms, was very successful. This scheme will also garner revenue for the government by the year-end.

Kaushik Mukerjee, Partner-Tax & Regulatory, PwC India

Non-corporate foreign assessees will also be eligible to approach the DRP, which will fast-track their litigation. Further, the DRP route will be open to any dispute irrespective of variation of income.

Pre-deposit before stay application to ITAT: The 20 per cent pre-deposit will henceforth be required. This may amount to curtailment of the powers of a quasi-judicial body and can face judicial scrutiny.

Transfer pricing: The scope of Safe Harbour and Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) will now cover attribution of profits to a Permanent Establishment (PE). This will provide certainty to business transactions for cross-border related parties. Given the expertise in APA administration, the results are expected to be much more scientific than arrived at through litigation. The scope of Advance Rulings can be similarly expanded to benefit other international transactions. Additionally, even unrelated parties can be allowed to approach APAs for similar profit attribution.

Conclusion

Overall, the proposals are intended to accelerate economic momentum and ease of living for taxpayers. The true experience of the simplest and smoothest direct taxes will lie in their administration.

['Jash Kriplani'],"Budget 2020: Selling pressure on stock market may continue, say experts","Market participants are expecting near-term volatility with the Union Budget skipping sector-specific stimulus packages for stressed segments such as real estate and non-bank financial services, and failing to meet domestic investors’ expectations on relaxing long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax.

Experts say selling pressure on the stock market may continue on Monday, even though $173-billion liquidity infusion by China’s central bank to boost its economy could provide some cushion.

On Saturday, the benchmark indices closed near their day’s lows, indicating further selling pressure on the following trading day. The Sensex ended 988 points, or 2.43 per cent, lower at 39,736 points, while the Nifty50 fell 300 points, or 2.51 per cent.

“The market was expecting the Budget to do more, given the domestic and global uncertainty. Over the next few days, the market is expected to absorb the volatility,” said Gaurav Dua, head of capital market strategy of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Foreign brokerages expect the risk-off stance to continue at least in the short term. “In the near term, the markets may gravitate back towards large-cap quality and defensive stocks. However, in the medium term, we expect equities to be largely driven by underlying mid-teens earnings growth,” said Goldman Sachs in a note.

The broking house has maintained the Nifty target of 13,000 by the end of 2020.

“Too early to say whether Budget Day volatility was a one-day event. We will have to see the market reaction this week as several institutional investors, especially foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), may not have participated as it was a Saturday,” said Krishna Sanghavi, chief investment officer (CIO) at Mahindra Mutual Fund.

Further, fund managers say a broader market recovery could get delayed as markets digest the implications of the Budget.

Flows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) can come back into the markets as the Budget relaxed taxation for overseas investors. For FPIs, dividend distribution tax would be calculated at the treaty agreements, and not attract domestic taxation rates. According to experts, this can have a material impact on the net equity returns of FPIs. On Saturday, FPIs sold Rs 1,200 crore worth of equities.

“We are generally positive on the Budget and we believe the market will gradually understand the positives from the Budget, after the knee-jerk reaction,” said Shankar Sharma, vice-chairman and joint managing director of First Global. Experts add that once the Budget-related noise abates, the market focus is likely to shift to earnings and global cues. “Future FPI inflows will depend on how economic and earnings growth play out,” said a fund manager.

For domestic investors, it was expected that the holding period for calculating LTCG tax on equity would be increased to two years. The stock market could find a stable footing on Monday as the China market is resuming trade and the Chinese government will be launching $173 billion worth of liquidity. Also, experts say the fallout of novel coronavirus will have an impact on emerging markets and India in the coming days.

['Somesh Jha'],"LIC listing may take about a year, says Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar","The listing of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) will likely take about one year and the government is not willing to sell more than 10 per cent stake in the insurance behemoth.

“We are already in touch with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) to understand all the processes involved. The LIC Act will have to be amended. It’s not possible to do it in six months and may take around one year,” Rajiv Kumar said in a media interaction on Sunday.

Kumar said the idea behind the listing of LIC was to “bring in more transparency and allow the company to share gains with its stakeholders”. “It is very important as it will bring in the disclosure norms,” he said.

The sovereign guarantee for all policies issued by LIC will continue, the secretary added.

A top government official said the enterprise value of LIC was roughly Rs 36 trillion “according to the latest figures in the balance sheet”. The official said the government might not dilute “more than 10 per cent” in LIC. “It will certainly be less than 10 per cent,” the official added.

The government might seek exemption from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to offload less than 10 per cent in the initial public offer (IPO).

All companies are required to offer at least 10 per cent in the IPO.

Finance Minister had announced a stake sale in LIC through an initial public offer in the Union Budget of 2020-21.

The government aims to mop up Rs 90,000 crore from the listing of LIC and stake sale in IDBI Bank. The government currently owns 100 per cent in LIC.

On the stake sale of IDBI Bank, which is substantially owned and controlled by LIC, Kumar said the government was exploring various options, including a strategic stake sale. The government currently holds around 46 per cent in IDBI Bank.

“It is proposed to sell the balance holding of the government in IDBI Bank to private, retail and institutional investors through the stock exchange,” Sitharaman said during her Budget speech on Saturday.

IDBI Bank had become a private bank last year when LIC acquired a controlling stake in it.

['Indivjal Dhasmana'],"FM Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget goal: Lower rates, simple structure","Finance Minister on Sunday said the new tax regime proposed in her second Budget would ultimately lead to lower rates with simple structure.

Dismissing criticism that the new regime would not be largely beneficial to the assessees, she said, “eventually this should lead to a system where people are taxed at the lowest possible rate and are given a simple system. I am starting a scheme, which will eventually end there. For this, I’m not forcing people.” She was speaking to the media in an informal interaction a day after presenting the Union Budget in Parliament.

The FM disagreed with experts who termed the new tax regime complex and unavailing. She said the new scheme would benefit some taxpayers falling in certain brackets, if not all.

“…because the income tax cuts are deeper in the new scheme, we believe a taxpayer from a particular income bracket will be much better off coming into the new system. And in the new system, which however much I repeatedly say has no exemptions, there are some exemptions that we have allowed,” Sitharaman said.

Industry experts, however, argued that two tax regimes with optionality for personal tax, as in case of corporate taxes, only make the structure more complicated. Analysts sent out data to explain how the new tax regime would not be beneficial for those who take exemptions.

But the minister said, “I believe many of the calculations have probably not taken into account the exemptions which have been allowed in the scheme.”



Sources in the finance ministry said 53 million out of a total of 57 million taxpayers in 2018-19 had claimed exemptions of less than Rs 2 lakh. In other words, only 4 million or less than 10 per cent taxpayers took exemptions of more than Rs 2 lakh.

Analysts based their analyses on those claiming deductions in the range of Rs 4 lakh to 5 lakh, which is a small proportion of the taxpayer base.

Archit Gupta, founder of Cleartax, said, “With the optional new regime, taxpayers will have to evaluate what works better for them. Those committed to long-term savings and investing via 80C may be discouraged and this may likely demotivate them from investing in tax-saving asset classes.”



Among others, Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar- Shaw tweeted that removal of exemptions and dividend distribution tax would hurt the individual taxpayer, impacting consumer spending.

Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking said the widely expected personal income tax cuts had come in with lots of caveats, leaving no major impact.

To a query that removal of exemptions would hit insurance companies, Sitharaman said the government was giving more money to the people and it’s up to them to choose a product.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-s-budget-goal-lower-rates-simple-structure-120020300028_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

The COVID-19 outbreak, which originated in China last December, has claimed over 6,500 lives and infected more than 169,000 people over 135 countries and territories.

According to Issac John, business head digital (South Asia), Discovery, along with ""Coronavirus: The Silent Killer"", the newly launched app will come up with two more originals on the disease in a fortnight besides the new special on March 18.

John said the attempt with these specials was to look at ""events that define the world and humanity"".

""We believe there is a lot more to it than what meets the eye. This special is just our first attempt at showing the world in terms of what its origins were and what led to its spiralling out of control.

""However, the interesting thing about the way we are looking at coronavirus is that there needs to be information that comes from trusted sources, that's essentially what Discovery brings to the table. Our take is to begin with this and over the next two weeks we will be dropping at least two more Discovery commissioned originals on coronavirus,"" he told PTI in an interview.

Be it covering the Thai cave rescue in 2018 or the rising coronavirus spread, John said, the network has closely followed ""rapidly evolving"" events around the world.

""It's really hard for the entire story to be captured in one-moment-of-truth kind of a storytelling narrative... We will continue to weave the narrative with the trust and credibility that Discovery has always had in defining it,"" he added.

Asked if Wuhan, the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak originated, feature in these specials, John declined to comment.

""Given that the topic is so sensitive, we don't want to say what's in it, what's not. What we are saying is that Discovery, like in the past, will have strong narrative pieces around most hotly searched, contested and concerning topics of this year,"" he said.

Megha Tata, managing director South Asia, Discovery, added that there were multiple ways of viewing the current situation around coronavirus.

""This upcoming special and the two others have a viewpoint. Every content piece has two sides of the story, especially in the infotainment space.

""When people start consuming it, they will know that this is one particular view to the issue,"" Tata said.

Discovery Plus, a direct-to-consumer streaming app, is now available for download on app stores.

The app will offer never-seen-before premium shows in 40+ genres including science, adventure, food, lifestyle.

['Nikita Vashisht'],Will the RBI cut rates today? Fiscal boost also needed to battle slowdown,"Interest rate cuts have become the go-to tool whenever a country finds itself in the midst of a market-related instability or an The recent (Covid-19) outbreak, too, has led to a clamour for a rate-cut to support the sentiment.

Understandably so, the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), in a surprise move, cut its key interest rate to a target range of 0 per cent and 0.25 per cent on Sunday. The cut comes close on the heels of a rate cut done on March 3. Bank of England, last week, too, cut its in an emergency move to bolster the economy, as did central banks of Australia and New Zealand on Monday.

Despite this, the US stock futures were locked in their lower limit on Sunday (Monday for India), after entering into a bear phase (down 20 per cent from the top) last week.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to hold a media interaction later in the day today. It is widely expected that the central bank will cut rates and announce measures to boost sentiment.

So, is the monetary action not enough? Maybe, say analysts.

According to JP Morgan, interest rate cuts may not assuage investors who are dealing with twin shocks of a slump in prices and the outbreak of Covid-19, leading to a sharp repricing in global markets, including in equities, fixed income, commodities and currencies.

“More than interest rate cut, the most important role for central banks to play is to ensure that liquidity remains ample. While investors have gotten addicted to monetary policy responses during this cycle, the more important reaction is actually from fiscal policy,” the brokerage notes.

Apart from the first order impact of the virus, JP Morgan cautions the governments across the globe, about the need to prevent second-order effects, especially from “social distancing”, such as job losses and bankruptcies.

“This would include several microeconomic measures that can provide support to affected small and medium businesses and their workers. This would help to soften the short-term negative impacts of Covid-19 and would help to strengthen the eventual rebound. It is crucial for people to have jobs to return to and businesses to go back to when life goes back to normal,” it underlines.

Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research, too, calls for a mixed action-plan - a combination of rate cuts and fiscal boost.

“We need monetary action, right now, to ensure that businesses – whose cash flows or working capital have been hit due to lack of demand in the wake of the virus outbreak -- don’t suffer when the economy crawls back to normalcy, and they don’t default on their loans,” he explains.

unmoved - for now

Despite global central banks cutting interest rates, the RBI, so far, has adopted a cautious approach. While there were no rate cuts till Monday, the central bank undertook currency swap operation of $2 billion to safeguard the rupee’s value against the US dollar.

“Going ahead, we expect the to buy $18 billion of forex forward to contain bond yields to make room for open market operation (OMO) ” say analysts at BofAML.

“What India needs is a mix of monetary and fiscal boost… While a rate cut may still be given, government doesn’t have the space to provide fiscal stimulus,” Pant of India Ratings says, adding that the provided now would have to be prudently reversed when the is curtailed.

The fall in price, therefore, can be a blessing for India in this case. According to estimates by BofAML, the fall in prices could lead to a potential boost of Rs 500 billion or 0.4 per cent of GDP to consumption, after the Rs 3 excise duty hike, is passed on to the consumer.

A boost in public spending through say, higher interest rate subsidies on mortgage or SME loans to support consumption demand, are some of the ways through which Centre could provide stimulus.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/will-the-rbi-cut-rates-today-fiscal-boost-also-needed-to-battle-slowdown-120031600477_1.html,Business Standard,Markets,True

SBI shall hold up to 49 per cent stake with a minimum of 26 per cent over the next three years.

There will be a lock-in of three years of a part of the investments made by these banks in YES Bank. As much as 26 per cent of SBI’s equity investment and 75 per cent of the equity pumped in by other players will be retained in YES Bank for three years. Only those shareholders, who have less than 100 shares in the bank, can sell their entire shareholding.

Moreover, YES Bank also declared its corporate results for the quarter December 2019 (Q3FY20) during the weekend in which it reported net loss of Rs 18,560 crore for the quarter. Net interest income declined 60 per cent year-on-year at Rs 1,065 crore, which was significantly impacted by elevated slippages.

Asset quality deteriorated with corporate gross non-performing lending (GNPL) rising to 30 per cent and SMA & investment stress book (not recognized) at Rs 17,500 crore at 8 per cent of loans. The management hopes to contain slippages for FY21 less than 5 per cent.

The management said the Bank’s near term focus will be on deposit mobilization, retail loans including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), cost optimization and acceleration in resolution of stressed assets.

“We, however, believe that the probability of overshooting the target remains high and despite non-performing loans and advances (NPL) coverage ratio of 73 per cent, credit cost could stay elevated and weak operating metrics could keep losses continuing and even if the bank turns profitable it would remain sub-optimal for the next couple of years. Key for the bank would be to restore depositors' faith,” analysts at Antique Stock Broking said in result review.

Asset quality numbers look catastrophic. Higher provisions also resulted in violation of RBI capital adequacy norms. With slippages’ guidance of 5 per cent until FY21, any respite in credit cost, and thereby profitability, is unlikely in the near term, analysts at Elara Capital said in quarterly update.

Analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities estimate that the bank will need another Rs 6,500- Rs 7,000 crore to address provisioning requirements as well as growth.

['Vaibhav Sanghavi'],Market valuation is attractive; time to take risk for long-term gains,"2020 has been a year of unprecedented volatility, starting from the problems in West Asia led by Iran, following up with China Coronavirus, Union Budget, breaking of OPEC-controlled oil prices and the subsequent spread of virus from China to other countries, leading to a World Health Organisation (WHO) declared pandemic. The effect of all these events has led to a massive dent in sentiment and global have corrected sharply.

From a global perspective, there is an expectation that economic growth will take a big hit, as countries lock down to control the spread of the virus. Global equity are thus correcting anticipating prolonged crisis.

Various Governments, and their respective central banks, have come in with fiscal and monetary measures to ease the pain of demand shock in the short-term. While volatility has risen to 2008 levels, we have to be careful to compare the current situation to 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). In my view both the events are very different and not comparable. Once the fresh new infection cases plateau, like we witnessed In China, normalcy should resume. In addition to the virus, oil prices has also seen a sharp correction. Failure to arrive at production cut targets among OPEC has added to global risk-off.

What we've read or seen about the pandemic, it is expected to stabilise within few months as a concerted effort is put together to curb the spread. Meanwhile, while this is likely to have a short-term impact, this should not structurally change the dynamics of an economy, making this a temporary phenomenon. In the interim, the fear factor is likely to be at its peak. The effect of co-ordinated monetary and fiscal easing leading to demand incentivisation and liquidity will show its full effect on the economy and once this short-term fear abates.

The Indian government, too, has been proactive and have initiated various measures to control the spread of virus. That said, there have been some encouraging green shoots on economic data over the last few months - viz. better index of industrial production (IIP) and Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) numbers. Lower crude prices may lead to lower inflation, and looking at our high real interest rates, there is a scope of a sizeable rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Indian economy per se is in a sweet spot, wherein we are largely dependent on domestic consumption and have relatively lesser global influence.

From an equity market perspective, we have always been complaining of relative higher valuations. After current market correction, valuations have become attractive and provide a great entry point for a long-term investor. Hence, the current problem that looks to be temporary, isn't changing the longer-term structural economic growth opportunity. Strong businesses will bounce back equally sharply post the stabilisation of pandemic.

Investors should look through the shorter-term pain and as the longer-term investment opportunity looks very attractive. That said, the short-term volatility would continue to remain elevated and investors need to manage risk. It is generally said that return is a factor of risk you take, and maybe this is a time where we should take risks to benefit from the potential of earning better returns from equities in the long term.

Last year, the state had failed to achieve its target and could log only about 3.8 MT of compared to the seasonal target of 5.5 MT. The sluggish procurement in the 2019-20 rabi season was attributed to the Lok Sabha elections apart from the competitive prices in the open market, which had provided a viable option to the famers to sell their produce.

Following the poor response last year, the state government had extended the procurement window by an additional 10 days to June 25, 2019 to partly achieve its target and keep the wheat prices firm in the market for the benefit of farmers. (See table)

The bulk of 2.5 MT and 0.5 MT would be procured by the UP Cooperative Federation Limited (UPCFL) and UP Cooperative Union (UPCU) respectively.

Addressing the media after the cabinet meeting, UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the farmers would be paid their dues directly into their bank accounts within 72 hrs.

After dropping to 8,555, the Nifty managed to end the day at 9,955, up 365 points, or 3.81 per cent, over the previous day’s close — and 16.4 per cent over the day’s low. The Sensex, after slipping to 29,389, staged a 4,700-point come back to end at 34,103.

The sharply-lower opening in the domestic market, as well as in other Asian markets, came in the wake of a 10 per cent plunge — the worst since 1987— in the Dow Jones index of the US.

Throughout the day, stocks exhibited wild swings, with many gyrating in a 30 per cent band. A day earlier, the Nifty had ended at a 33-month low, pushing the domestic into “bear territory”.

To stem the rout, Asian central banks announced aggressive measures. The People’s Bank of China decided to inject $79 billion into the economy through a reduction in reserve ratios. The Bank of Japan offered to provide $20.8-billion liquidity, while the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Korea took steps to iron out currency fluctuations. Lawmakers in the US were also expected to unveil a legislative package to address the economic fallout.

The US Federal Reserve promised to start purchasing a range of treasuries -- a step that effectively marks a return to the 2008 crisis-era bond-buying programme known as quantitative easing.

The sharp recovery in the markets was on optimism around stimulus measures announced by various central banks, said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services.

""After another sharp fall, some had to sell desperately to honour margin commitments. Following the early morning rout, huge value emerged in several stocks,” said U R Bhat, director, Dalton Capital India.

Apart from the stimulus packages, analysts said “short-covering” contributed to the dramatic recovery. Market players said the markets were not yet out of the woods as COVID-19 (disease caused by coronavirus) cases across the globe continued to rise.

Also, the selling by overseas investors showed no signs of easing. On Friday, overseas investors sold shares worth over Rs 6,000 crore, extending their 14-day sell-off to Rs 43,000 crore. After the latest jump, the Sensex and the Nifty are down 17 per cent from their all-time highs, logged in January. Sanjay Mookim, India Equity Strategist, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted while the market valuations had slipped below historical levels, further slide could not be ruled out.

""Sentiment around COVID-19 is driving global equities. Several large economies still need to contain the virus. This may require more drastic lockdowns and economic checks. That could drive a market to undershoot,"" he said.

Mookim said despite the sharp correction, ""we have still not reached the 'Kid-in-Toy-Shop' moment"". ""Quality, steady-growth stocks are still far from being cheap,"" he noted. Analysts said it remained to be seen if emergency fiscal and monetary packages would be enough to avert a global recession.

""We cannot say for sure that it has reached the bottom for two reasons. One is volatility in the stocks markets; second is There is nothing to suggest that things that oil-producing nations have reached an agreement to cut production. As far as the corona outbreak is concerned, most of the developed countries are locked-in, and trade is going to be a big sufferer,” said Bhat.

The sharp drop in the indices in morning trade prompted a meeting of Securities and Exchange Board of India officials.

An spokesperson did not want to comment on the issue, but currency dealers were almost certain that the Indian central bank had shed all its inhibition to operate overseas, beyond its comfort zone, to protect the If offshore intervention happened, it would likely be for the first time ever. But some keen currency observers said the might not be a complete stranger to these markets.

“The central bank may have been intervening in these markets in small measures in the past too, but Friday’s action was quite loud,” said a senior currency dealer, requesting anonymity.

“It looks like there was globally coordinated action. Everything went up together. Stocks rose, crude oil and metals rose, currencies strengthened, the really did a smart comeback, and offshore forward points collapsed. There are tell-tale signs that the may have intervened in offshore markets,” said the currency dealer.

Abhishek Goenka, managing director at IFA Global, said the RBI heavily sold dollars even when there was huge risk aversion. And so, “as the risk on sentiment came back, the rupee benefitted”.

According to Goenka, the fall in the crude oil prices has managed to protect the rupee, otherwise the currency could have reached 77 a The RBI, it seems, would want to protect the rupee’s lifetime closing lows of 74.48 a dollar it reached in October 2018.

The RBI doesn’t put out direct data on its domestic intervention, but the data on dollar purchase and sales comes with a two-month lag. However, currency dealers get to know any central bank intervention by seeing how the exchange rate swings on persistent dollar buying or selling by nationalised banks. These banks work as a go-between the RBI and the markets.

However, if the RBI has to intervene in offshore markets — located in Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and New York — it has to do it through local banks there. Or, it can take help from other central banks, which can intervene directly. For example, the Malaysian Central Bank and South Korean central bank are known to have capabilities to directly intervene in these markets.

['Jon Hurdle'],A formula for growth after the start-up stage,"Much attention is paid to how entrepreneurs create an innovative product or service and bring it to market, pivoting quickly to solve financial and logistical challenges along the way. But after the start-up buzz wears off, owners must figure out how to scale their businesses for long-term, stable growth.

Rather than simply working harder, a new report suggests, second-stage should consider a different strategy to reach the middle market, incorporating five conditions that were compiled and tracked by TrueSpace, a consulting firm, and the analytics firm Gallup.

They looked at nearly 2,500 entrepreneurs in the United States over five years to create the model, which is geared toward businesses with $2 million to $10 million in annual revenue that are struggling to become midsize

“After you get to this post-start-up phase, you have to fundamentally almost recreate the business,” said Joe Daly, senior partner at Gallup. “That’s what begins to create the conditions for the next leap in growth.”

The report, released Thursday, identified the five conditions that small businesses should consider adopting: organizational alignment, operating discipline, predictability of performance, endurance of stakeholders and value creation.

The project’s data shows that the tighter a company’s focus on its market, the stronger its revenue will be, said Charles Fred, chairman and chief executive of TrueSpace. But most entrepreneurs do the opposite when faced with flagging sales, and end up dissipating their energies without the desired results.

Second-stage may have trouble growing if they do not take a strategic approach to their expansion, said Gad Allon, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

“Where these firms usually struggle is that the opportunistic approach that brought them to where they are doesn’t work as the firm grows,” Dr. Allon said.

He added that the framework provided by TrueSpace could be useful, but that it was unlikely to be able to predict performance. “It’s good advice, but there’s nothing new in this good advice,” he said.

Damian Salas, assistant dean at Drexel University’s Charles D. Close School of Entrepreneurship in Philadelphia, agreed that the ideas behind the five conditions were not new, but said their combination was novel and could offer second-stage companies a way of moving to the next level.

“Small businesses are generally reactive organizations, and growth is often just another challenge to meet,” he said.

For some business owners, the framework has already helped increase revenue.

SurgiReal, based in Loveland, Colo., builds task trainers to help medical professionals acquire skills they need like giving injections or sewing sutures. It is “on the cusp” of $2 million in annual revenue, said Andrew Hendrickson, the company’s chief executive. He had been trying to sell the products in about half a dozen markets, but he found that growth was well short of its potential.

“We were past the point of being a like a true start-up but not quite at middle market yet,” Mr. Hendrickson said. “It was time to graduate to someone who was going to help us do scaling.”

He added that the TrueSpace strategy had sharply focused the company’s efforts.

“We had cast our net too wide,” he said. “Rather than looking at five or six market segments to be tackled individually, we were tackling them all at the same time, which prevented us from really penetrating one to a greater extent.”

Now the company is concentrating on selling to just one market segment within the medical industry.

Shawn K. Smith, the chief executive of Modern Teacher, an educational technology company in Chicago, had a similar experience. The company has been using the TrueSpace model for two years, and Mr. Smith said it had increased the company’s enterprise value up to seven times its revenue, from one to two times revenue.

Mr. Smith said the model had allowed the company to go from essentially being a consultant dependent on nonrecurring revenue to being one with sustainable income and a clear path to growth.

With current revenue just under $3 million a year, Modern Teacher aims to hit $5 million in 18 months, he said.

Other consulting firms and colleges offer guidance on business strategy, but much of it is geared to start-ups or larger companies, Mr. Smith said, and there’s not much help out there for firms in his category.

“There was so much clarity in it,” he said of the TrueSpace program. “We had some of the pieces in place. But alignment to the market was critical for us because what that produced was predictability.”",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/a-formula-for-growth-after-the-start-up-stage-120022200892_1.html,Business Standard,Start Ups,True

""Fintech investments in India nearly doubled to $3.7 billion in 2019 from $1.9 billion the previous year, putting the country as the world's third largest fintech centre, behind only the US and UK,"" an Accenture analysis of data from CB Insights said.

The number of deals was up slightly to 198 last year from 193 in 2018, it added.

Investments in payments more than tripled to $2.1 billion from about $660 million in 2018, while funding into insur-techs rose 74 per cent to $510 million.

The vast majority of funds raised last year in India went into payments startups (58 per cent), while insur-techs raked in 13.7 per cent of the investments and fintechs in lending accounted for 10.8 per cent of the total, as per the data.

['Peerzada Abrar'],"Quikr no longer a unicorn, Swedish investor pares valuation by 45%","Online classifieds marketplace is no longer a unicorn, or a start-up valued at more than $1 billion. In its year-end report, major shareholder Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm, devalued by 45 per cent, referring to the exaggerated revenue resulting from fraudulent transactions that rocked the company. is now valued at about $577 million, a significant drop for the Bengaluru-based startup.

“Our assessed fair value of our Quikr investment is lowered by SEK 764 million, or 45 per cent, reflecting the impact of fraudulent transactions as well as a reduced footprint and amended revenue recognition principles,” said Kinnevik this month, in its presentation of the fourth quarter and full-year 2019. “The valuation is established using forward looking net revenue multiples, moving away from the DCF (discounted cash flow) method applied in previous quarters to solely reflect near-term projected financial performance in our net asset value statement.”

Quikr has a slew of online businesses covering real estate, discover and bookings, jobs search, used-goods buying and selling, and home services. The drop in valuation comes at a time, when the company had to suffer crores of losses due to internal employee fraud and as reported, the firm had to lay off hundreds of employees across the organisation late last year.

In the earning call, Samuel Sjöström, Head of Strategy at Kinnevik, explained that Quikr discovered that certain dealers and vendors within their managed rentals and car segments had placed fictitious or misrepresented transactions on its platform. The direct effect of this was twofold.

“Firstly, the value of revenue generated in these categories may be overstated. And secondly, there is a risk that some receivables may not be entirely recoverable. As a response, the company has reduced its footprint in the concerned segments as managing its overall cost base. Quikr has also strengthened its internal operational controls and is pursuing legal actions against those responsible,” said Sjöström, in the earnings call.

He said going forward Quikr's other business segments, such as blue-collar jobs, used goods, classifieds and real-estate sales have historically accounted for a majority of revenue and continue to see growth and occupy strong positions in the respective markets.

“While we are very disappointed with what has been uncovered and its effect on the value of our investment, we believe that the measures that have been taken and are being taken are both forceful and proportionate, and their clear intention is to leave us with a healthier but somewhat smaller company,” said Sjöström.

Kinnevik CEO Georgi Ganev said in the earnings call that the Quikr has laid off a lot of their workforce, basically, half of the workforce in order to become profitable faster and not dependent on funding. “Which is, of course, something that we appreciate. So we sit now with a smaller company, but we also think it's much healthier. And we will, of course, focus on those remaining verticals and to continue to grow them going forward,” said Ganev. “So of course, we are very disappointed in what we have found at Quikr, but we remain confident that we will actually get out in a way that is somewhat more positive than what you see today for our shareholders,” said Ganev.

Founded in 2008, Quikr had left a memorable footprint in over 1000 cities. Late last year, Pranay Chulet, founder and CEO of Quikr, had said in an interview that the company was gearing up for a public market offering in 2021, joining a list of few top internet ventures in the country that are aiming to go public in the coming years.

Quikr has raised a total of $424.2 million in funding over 12 rounds from investors such as Tiger Global Management, Kinnevik, Trifecta Capital Advisors and InnoVen Capital, according to data platform Crunchbase.

It has also made a few big acquisitions in the past. In 2016, it bought Commonfloor for an all-stock deal of $200 million, followed by RealtyCompass, a real estate listings platform.

""Startups are hesitant to do IPO, which is not difficult. My biggest issue with the ecosystem today is that they are not doing an Let the Indian public own these They get the wealth being created,"" he said while inaugurating the 5th edition of the two-day 'Seeding Kerala' organised by Kerala Mission (KSUM) here.

""India has $2 trillion of wealth in private hands. Less than one per cent is invested in ecosystem. We need High Networth Individuals (HNIs) money going into startups,"" he added.

Gopalakrishnan advised startups to take minimum funds from angel, friends and families. They have to create minimum viable product, and establish unit economics and profitable model, he underlined.

""To make a successful new business is one which employs people, creates jobs and employment, and it is a sustainable and profitable business you can run it for a long time.

""Longevity is the best measure for the successful business. Society needs stable businesses that create good jobs and creates wealth for the society. Our best late stage startups are owned by non-Indian entities. More than 95 per cent of funding comes from non-Indian entities,"" he said.

Noting that Kerala community is innovative, entrepreneurial and action-oriented, Gopalakrishnan said the startup ecosystem in the state is getting recognition for its innovation, ideas and path-breaking initiatives.

""Studies have shown that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector is the backbone of any economy. More than 60 per cent of jobs are created through them,"" he said.

Interestingly, maximum number of jobs are created in the first five years of the businesses of startups and there is a need for a large number of MSMEs, he added.

""New jobs are created only if new businesses are created. We need to have best milieu for new business for maximum job creation. Among the with largest market capital in the world today, except Amazon, rest of them employ very few people. There are significant opportunities today to disrupt any business,"" he said.

Gopalakrishnan said India today has one of the most advanced fintech ecosystems, which even the US is also looking to implement. He also suggested creation of a database of viable businesses leveraging local strengths and ecosystem.

""We need to identify people passionate about starting a business and train them on business basics, including running business legally and ethically. They can select a business from the database and get trained on the business idea, followed by registering it,"" he explained.

Gopalakrishnan also interacted with 10 startup founders on the sidelines of the event.

M Sivasankar, Principal Secretary (Electronics and IT), government of Kerala, who presided over the function, said, ""One of the ways to address scarcity of fund is to tap the funds from the alumni meet of engineering batches. Besides, we need to create networks of people, who believe in Kerala to invest.""

['Pavan Lall'],Early-round funding in startups almost doubles in 2 yrs; Chinese lead,"Start-ups have seen the size of early-stage funding rounds almost double in the past two years because of increased foreign capital in the system, growing traction of established entrepreneurs, and evolved technology being used across sectors to grow faster, bigger and better.

Roopa Kudva, managing director with impact investor Omidyar Network India, says there are a lot more Chinese funds chasing today. That includes Fosun RZ Capital, CDH Investments, GGV Capital, Tencent Shunwei Capital, and Morningside Venture Capital.

According to market research by Tracxn, which tracks start-ups and funding, India saw investments of about $1.31 billion till November in calendar year 2019, up from just $65 million in 2017. “The other driver is that as the landscape has evolved, investors have become much more focused on unit economics, monetisation, and profitability than five years ago, when it was just growth that was chased,” Kudva adds.

Archana Hingorani, managing partner with early-stage venture fund Siana Capital, says that it’s clear that funding rounds have grown in value over the last couple years. “My sense is that two things are happening. It’s no longer just about fintech plays for VCs and investors.

The second is there is a need across the board for any business model to improve with the incorporation of technology and that doesn’t matter how you define it whether it is software, AI, or machine learning. Take healthcare, for example, everything on it is being overhauled as we speak, and that leads to a large appetite for capital.”

For instance, Omidyar invested in Healofy, a pregnancy and parenting app that caters to people in regional languages, and just announced another investment in Axio, a medtech venture that uses military-grade technology to stop bleeding immediately.

The other push is coming from the fact that there are far more established entrepreneurs in India today who are looking to start the next venture than five years ago. Examples include Freecharge Chairman Kunal Shah, who started CRED; former Myntra Founder Mukesh Bansal, who started Cure.fit; former Ibibo founder Ashish Kashyap, who started INDwealth; and, Sachin Bhatia, the former co-founder of MakeMyTrip, who co-started Bulbul.tv.

“Once an entrepreneur has had a track record of success, it automatically allows for the next venture to be capitalised and funded at higher levels,” Kudva said.

In addition, while several ventures backed by private equity (PEs) and VCs earlier were copycats of international businesses — including Flipkart and Ola — today the model is about looking to build businesses that solve India-specific problems.

For example, RailYatri, an indian travel marketplace site, provides information on which platform is crowded, what the chances are of a ticket being confirmed.

Sandeep Murthy, partner with venture capital firm Lightbox, which backed Bombay Shirt Company, and Rebel Foods, says that the trend isn’t limited to India. “I would argue that it’s a trend globally and is because of a mix of things,” he says. “What a company used to need has all gone up: cost of customer acquisitions, cost of efficiencies in technologies, and the cost of managerial talent.” The cost of a product head that was Rs 50 lakh three years ago is now between Rs 70-80 lakh.

The survey was conducted during November 2018 and April 2019 with 1,246 start-up participants.

“Nearly three-fourths of the participants were from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, indicating large concentration of the start-up sector in India in a few states,” the RBI’s pilot survey on Indian start-up sector revealed.

Nearly half of the start-ups were from six sectors — agriculture, data and analytics, education, health, IT consulting/solution, and manufacturing. The respondents said there was market or industry demand, both in domestic and international markets, for the services and products they would provide.

The annual turnover for over one-fourth of the respondents was up to Rs 10 lakh, whereas around 20 per cent start-ups did not report any revenue generation. Less than one-fifth of the respondents reported that their turnover exceeded Rs 1 crore.

The Accel and Sequoia-backed company has won a competitive bid to provide its dockless scooter-sharing service at the railway stations in Karnataka. This makes it the first start-up to win such a deal.

The company will be able to expand its operations across 13 Bengaluru railway stations, helping passengers in the city with first and last-mile connectivity.

“With the load on road infrastructure, there is an urgent need to shift away from personal mobility to public transportation and shared mobility. To increase adoption of public transportation, it’s imperative to create integrated multimodal connectivity to make daily commute seamless,” said Vivekananda Hallekere, chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder,

“We’re happy to be working with the authorities such as Bengaluru Railway Division, which recognised the importance of shared mobility services and enabled us further to provide accessible mobility. This is happening for the first time ever in the country. We are positive that it’ll help lakhs of railway commuters with their first and last-mile commute.”

Through the partnership with the Bengaluru Railway Division, plans to introduce 698 scooters at 13 Bengaluru railway stations. Bounce scooters will make their debut at places such as Bellandur, Yelahanka, Banaswadi, Whitefield, Yeshwanthpur and Kengeri.

Parking lots have been allotted at two entrances in each of these stations to pick up or drop off Bounce bikes.

By providing bike service from the premise of railway stations, Bounce said it aims to improve connectivity and encourage citizens to use railway services.

Integration of hired, shared and public transport services will ensure all modes of commute complement each other and provide a seamless experience to citizens.

Since the last two years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people using the suburban rail service.

It is particularly popular among office-goers looking to avoid traffic.

This year, 1.5 lakh passengers opted to travel by the South Western Railway’s intracity trains, an increase from 1.4 lakh passengers in 2016-17.

According to a recent proposal by Rail India Technical and Economic Service (Rites), suburban trains are projected to have a total daily ridership of 9.28 lakh in 2025.

At a time when hours spent commuting has gone up because of traffic congestion, Bounce feels suburban railway acts as a cheap and fast alternative for the long commute.

However, the first and last-mile connectivity is still a critical issue. In Bengaluru, railways see lakhs of people coming in or going out of the city from various stations. The city’s fragmented transport system and evolving public transport impact a sizable number of these travellers. A recent survey showed that 70 per cent of citizens in Bengaluru felt the need for improving first and last-mile connectivity.

Bounce, which was recently valued at $500 million in a funding round, is scaling on a par with global players, including US-based scooter rental Lime and Bird.

The company has already partnered three Mass Rapid Transport systems – Namma Metro, Hyderabad Metro and Nagpur Metro. Within a year, 42 per cent of Bounce rides either originated or culminated at Namma Metro; around 40,000 of the nearly one lakh daily rides undertaken have been metro commuters.

The company operates in Bengaluru with 13,000 dockless scooters and has a presence in over 35 cities in the rental and docked model.

The start-up’s app allows the users to pick up a scooter and drop it at any legitimate parking spot. The bikes are enabled with the latest tech solutions like Bluetooth helmets, tilt and tow sensors. They also have features like global positioning system (GPS ) tagging, geo-fencing and sensors that alert the team in case of a crash or battery tampering.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/after-metro-bounce-s-scooters-to-be-available-at-railway-stations-119122700856_1.html,Business Standard,Start Ups,True

['Yuvraj Malik'],"HomeLane raises $30 mn from Pidilite, others in series D financing","HomeLane, a web-enabled interior design firm, has raised $30 million in series D financing from Evolvence India, Pidilite Group and FJ Labs.

Evolvence is a Dubai-based fund of funds with investment in some Indian private equity players. Pidilite is a publicly-listed adhesive and industrial chemicals maker, while FJ Labs, an investor in Fynd and Zoomcar, is a fund co-founded by OLX founder Fabrice Grinda.

Existing investors Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and JSW Ventures also participated in the round, which takes the total capital raised by the five-year old start-up to $46 million.

Interior designing has mostly been an offline affair. HomeLane, as well as its competitor LivSapce, bring together designers, paints and other inputs providers and customers over the internet. They decide on the contours of the project which is then executed by in a tight time frame.

In October last year, LivSpace raised $70 million led by TPG Capital and is now reportedly in talks to raise another growth round.

founder Srikanth Iyer said the capital wouldbe used to fuel expansion in six to eight new cities. It currently services Mumbai, National Capital Region, Chennai, Kolkata, NCR, Pune and Bengaluru, and has 16 experience centres across these cities.

The expansion would require the firm to on-board designers, vendors and installers. A part of the funds will also be used to scale SpaceCraft, HomeLane’s proprietary visualisation and design tool.

['Nidhi Rai'],"As UPI gears up for global markets, Indian fintechs smell opportunity","While (UPI) is all set to test international markets, Indian fintechs working in and around are looking at it as a great growth opportunity.

Few of the fintechs have already started getting queries from international banks, financial institutions and governments. Most of the queries are coming from Singapore, UAE, China, Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Bangladesh and South East Asian countries.

Market players believe that any economy which does not have a strong card and net banking network will be open to the person to person (P2P) or account to account transfer technology of The biggest unique selling proposition for is its two factor authentication feature which is not common in other economies.

Mandar Agashe, MD and Founder of Sarvatra Technologies said, “UPI is already a scaled up payment system which has proved its metal in such a complex economy like India. For other economies nothing is as complex as our challenges of languages, processes, multiple gadgets and the huge population. Others have to pick UPI customize it as per their banks and they are good to go.”

This opens immense business opportunities for these fintechs who can share their technology with other countries. “We have Philippines, China, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and a lot of South East Asia since it is so fertile for innovation. People from all over, even China reach out to us on Linkedin,” said Anand Kumar Bajaj, Founder & CEO, PayNearby.

A demo of transactions made using the UPI started in Singapore on November 13. The project is expected to launch by February 2020. It is jointly developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS) of Singapore. Experts believe that Singapore is a transitory economy therefore launching UPI there will be very helpful. This can help in cross pollination of UPI for India.

""We know that many countries are vying for this technology. I can’t put a time-line, but keeping in mind theirs and ours eco-political climate but I think a two months integration, or it should be done by April 2020"", said Bajaj.

Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has setup a subsidiary to export the much acclaimed UPI for governments and central banks interested in implementing similar instant fund transfer in their countries.

Google has also written to US central bank to adopt a similar payment infrastructure as India citing the UPI example. Google vice president Mark Isakowitz has written in his letter, ""UPI was thoughtfully planned and critical aspects of its design led to its success. The approach in India attained amazing results for banks, consumers and other players within the payments ecosystem and the central bank.""

UPI is an interoperable instant fund transfer technology created by NPCI that enables inter-bank fund transfer.

There are currently 140 member banks using the UPI rails to enable payments for customers across the banking sector. The NPCI is RBI's payment governance arm and is owned by a consortium of top Indian banks. Since its launch in April, 2016, months prior to demonetization, UPI has become India's fastest growing payment transfer interface clocking over 1 billion transactions worth around $27 billion in the month of November 2019.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/as-upi-gears-up-for-global-markets-indian-fintechs-smell-opportunity-119121801213_1.html,Business Standard,Start Ups,True

['Kyle Buchanan'],"Oscars 2020 predictions: Who will win best picture, actor and actress","Best Picture

1917; Ford v Ferrari; The Irishman; Jojo Rabbit; Joker; Little Women; Marriage Story; Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Parasite

As your Oscar-pool guru, I would be remiss in predicting any best-picture winner besides 1917. The Sam Mendes-directed war movie has taken top honours from both the Producers and Directors guilds as well the director and drama prizes at the Golden Globes, and that’s the sort of awards-season war chest no other contender can compete with. Though it debuted late last year, 1917 is cresting at just the right time: After six weeks of release, it’s made more than $120 million domestically, and it occupied the No. 2 slot at the box office last weekend.

But.

I still can’t shake the feeling that Parasite could pull off an upset, in much the same way Moonlight vaulted over La La Land just three years ago. Bong Joon Ho’s widely loved South Korean thriller would be the first foreign-language film to win best picture, and by picking it, voters could help rehabilitate the academy’s reputation for being too insular and white. The film’s cast members garnered a standing ovation at the Screen Actors Guild Awards even before they won the top prize of the night. Parasite has passion, no doubt.

Is that enough? I’m playing it safe with 1917, but stay tuned: It’ll be close.

Best Director

Sam Mendes, 1917; Martin Scorsese, The Irishman; Todd Phillips, Joker; Quentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite

Five of the last seven Oscar races have come down to a split in the top two categories, so is it possible that even if 1917 wins best picture, Bong could still be rewarded with the best-director Oscar? Yes, though I wouldn’t bet on it: When such a split occurs, the directing winner usually hails from the bigger, more technically audacious film, and that describes Mendes and his long-take war movie to a T.

Best Actor

Joaquin Phoenix, Joker; Antonio Banderas, Pain and Glory; Leonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Adam Driver, Marriage Story; Jonathan Pryce, The Two Popes

Oscar voters are drawn to the tangible act of transformation, and though many of the nominees in this category are playing against type — including DiCaprio as a washed-up actor and Banderas as a quiet artist wrestling with pain — there is no more ostentatious act of transformation than Phoenix’s wrenching, intensely physical performance as the Joker. Considered by many to be the best actor of his generation, Phoenix has never won an Oscar. That will change on Sunday.

Best Actress

Renee Zellweger, Judy; Cynthia Erivo, Harriet; Scarlett Johansson, Marriage Story; Saoirse Ronan, Little Women; Charlize Theron, Bombshell

Sixteen years after Zellweger was awarded her first Oscar, a supporting-actress trophy for Cold Mountain, she will again return to the winner’s circle for playing a down-and-out Judy Garland in the last year of her life. None of the other contenders ever amassed enough momentum to truly compete with Zellweger, who’s been sitting pretty as the favourite all season. She’ll now become the 21st woman to win more than one Oscar for acting.

Best Supporting Actor

Brad Pitt, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Tom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood; Anthony Hopkins, The Two Popes; Al Pacino, The Irishman; Joe Pesci, The Irishman

Though the 56-year-old Pitt already possesses an Oscar for producing the best-picture winner 12 Years a Slave, he has never won an Academy Award for acting, and his confident performance in Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood offers a full-throttle testimonial to his star power. After charming and unexpectedly funny acceptance speeches at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards, there’s no way Pitt goes home on Oscar night empty-handed. Don’t you want to know what he’ll say?

Best Supporting Actress

Laura Dern, Marriage Story; Kathy Bates, Richard Jewell; Scarlett Johansson, Jojo Rabbit; Florence Pugh, Little Women; Margot Robbie, Bombshell

Dern has a clear path to victory here: The only supporting-actress contender who had earned a comparable amount of buzz was the Hustlers star Jennifer Lopez, and she didn’t even make the list of five nominees. For voters who enjoyed Marriage Story, a vote for Dern ensures the movie won’t go home empty-handed, and the 52-year-old actress is an enormously well-liked figure enjoying the sort of career resurgence that Oscar is always eager to reward.

Original Screenplay

Parasite, Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Won; Knives Out, Rian Johnson; Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach; 1917, Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns; Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino

Tarantino has won the original-screenplay Oscar twice before, so he can’t be counted out here. Still, the path to best picture almost always goes through one of the screenplay categories, and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood has lost much of its momentum for the top award. The best-picture front-runner 1917 is probably too sparse a screenplay to win in this category, so I expect the win will go to twisty Parasite, the night’s other big contender for the top Oscar.

['Ben Sisario'],"Grammy nominations 2020: Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X dominate","Lizzo, a charismatic new pop and R&B star, has been nominated for eight prizes at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards, leading a class dominated by fresh faces like Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X.

Lizzo spent much of the last decade as a struggling rapper and singer, but broke through this year with hits like “Juice” and “Truth Hurts,” and a bold, body-positive persona. Little known to mainstream audiences a year ago, she is now up for every major award at the Grammys, including album of the year for the deluxe version of “Cuz I Love You,” record and song of the year for “Truth Hurts,” and best new artist, the Recording Academy announced on Wednesday.

Not so long ago, the Grammys were routinely criticised for rewarding journeyman stars and rock elders at the expense of pop’s younger and more vital ranks. No longer. Continuing a trend that has been building for several years, the latest crop of nominees are young, diverse and largely reflective of the forefront of pop.

Lizzo’s competition includes two artists with six nominations each: Eilish, a 17-year-old alternative auteur who has built a wildly devoted following, and Lil Nas X, a 20-year-old rapper and master of internet memes whose “country-trap” hybrid “Old Town Road” became an all-pervasive cultural phenomenon this year, breaking Billboard’s singles chart record with 19 weeks at No. 1.

Eilish’s “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” is up for album of the year; “Bad Guy” is up for record and song of the year; and Eilish is a contender for best new artist. She is the youngest person to be nominated for all four top categories. Finneas O’Connell, her brother and primary collaborator, received five nods for his work with her as a producer and songwriter.

Lil Nas X was nominated for record of the year for the remix of “Old Town Road” (which features the country star Billy Ray Cyrus) and album of the year for “7,” an eight-song EP. He is also up for best new artist, in what may be seen as a challenge to the academy’s more conservative voting ranks, who have often been reluctant to reward artists they view as untested.

Alternative auteur Billie Eilish

But Lil Nas X has also come to stand for many of the changes now sweeping pop music. “Old Town Road” first exploded as a hit on TikTok, the video app, and his blithe combination of rap and country highlighted the increasing blurring of genre. At first, Nashville struggled to accept him; last week, “Old Town Road” won best musical event at the Country Music Association Awards.

Even so, Lil Nas X was not nominated in any of the Grammys’ country categories. The nominees for country album of the year are Eric Church’s “Desperate Man,” Reba McEntire’s “Stronger Than the Truth,” Pistol Annies’ “Interstate Gospel,” Thomas Rhett’s “Center Point Road” and Tanya Tucker’s “While I’m Livin’.”

The awards ceremony will be held on Jan. 26 in Los Angeles, and broadcast by CBS.

Among this year’s other top nominees, Ariana Grande received five nods, including record of the year for “7 Rings” — a recasting of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “My Favorite Things” — and album of the year for “Thank U, Next.” The young R&B singer H.E.R., who took home two awards at the most recent Grammys, is also up for five, including album of the year for “I Used to Know Her” and record and song of the year for “Hard Place.” (Record of the year is for performers and producers, while the song category recognises songwriters.)

Winners will be chosen by the academy’s 11,000 voting members.

['Vanessa Friedman'],Gaultier's great goodbye,"Jean Paul Gaultier, the French designer who put Madonna in a bullet-bra and men in skirts, scandalised the couture establishment by hosting the TV show “Eurotrash” and never forgot his sense of humour, yet could cut a tuxedo with such panache he was regarded as an heir to Yves Saint Laurent, said goodbye to the runway after 50 years this week.

He did it in the gilded 19th-century Théâtre du Châtelet, where the Ballets Russes once danced, in front of a packed 2,500-seat audience that included the former supermodel and the former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and the designers Nicolas Ghesquière (who began his career as a junior assistant to Gaultier), Christian Lacroix and Dries Van Noten, who had made the trip in from Antwerp, Belgium, just for the evening.

And he did it with a greatest hits spectacular starring friends and family, from the actors Béatrice Dalle and Rossy De Palma to the models Yasmin Le Bon and Paris Jackson, plus the burlesque star Dita Von Teese. Plus Boy George, who opened the whole thing with his own version of Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black,” and closed it with “Church of the Poison Mind”.

Gaultier, 67, stepped back from the ready-to-wear runway in 2014, but this was his final farewell — at least to shows. It seems he will continue to have some role in his company, which is owned by the Spanish group Puig, and he’s already dabbling in a sideline as a cabaret director. He announced his departure from the catwalk only five days ago, via Instagram.

To a certain extent, simply surviving a half century is an achievement in a fashion world where these days designers seem to come and go almost annually. Gaultier navigated the move from family-run artisanal houses to global brands dominated by mega groups, and did his time as creative director of a big house, taking the reins at Hermès from 2003 to 2010. If he has been, latterly, more of a prankster than anything else, wallowing in his own thematic puns — 1980s pop stars! Nanook of the North! — sometimes to the detriment of the clothes themselves, he also helped the shape the industry as we know it.

His final collection was no different; balanced on the knife edge between showgirl and chic, listing toward the former. Gaultier overindulged himself with more than 200 looks, not just reminders of favourites past (corsetry and underwear-as-outerwear; denim sliced and embroidered and elevated; tuxedo trousers turned into hot pants in front, the legs streaming out like a train behind; the blue-and-white-striped marinière; a body suit with the naked body embroidered on top) but examples of his artistry; his ability to make you look — and then think again.

He didn’t just recycle his themes, he upcycled his fabrics, melding silk ties into striped skirts, leather bombers into a bubble mini, and false-fronting jackets onto the top of corsets.

Camouflage coats billowed like clouds; columns of crochet encrusted in elaborate embroidered runes; basket-woven leathers; a breast plate made from mother-of-pearl shells atop a skirt made of real sponges.

“I have opened all my drawers, taken back all my old collections,” he wrote in his farewell note. “I have used my archives as material. Goodbye, the brand-new; hello, the brand old. What I did at the beginning with no resources, I do today with my inheritance to give life to new creations.”

Overlying it all was such a reservoir of well-earned good will, it cast the entire collection in a rosy glow.

And it was a potent reminder, as the designer was carried off on the arms of his cast, dancing and hugging his way into his future, that fashion ought to be both challenging and fun, and is best accessorised with laughter.

['Veer Arjun Singh'],Adidas Ultraboost 20: A performance powerhouse for athletes,"dreamt of a gravity-defying shoe and shot off its beloved Ultraboost to the International Space Station. While it did get a futuristic paint-job that screams “I was in space”, the Ultraboost 20 seems to have learned the rest from Earth’s streets. It’s a refresher of last year’s Ultraboost 19 with subtle but crucial changes. Here’s how the pair felt on feet in Delhi’s punishing cold.

Design (4/5)

The Ultraboost 19 introduced a one-piece upper that wraps around the foot like a sock called PrimeKnit. In most colourways, it has a multi-colour hue with an additional layer of threading in the vamp area or around the midsole or both. The UB20 changes the upper to a uniformly coloured, single-tone PrimeKnit textile, reminiscent of the original Ultraboost. A single colour upper goes well with the alien-inspired purple-hued, multi-colored midsole. I’d recommend the black colourway (pictured) if you are a runner first and a sneakerhead after. The white and grey, much like the many colourways of the UB19, are beautiful sneakers but impractical for a performance shoe that mustn’t be boxed.

The translucent lace cage of the UB19 also gets a revamp with a reflective three-stripes logo. The tongue looks tidier in a single stitch. The heel, constructed with neoprene instead of PrimeKnit, is a change I appreciate the most. It does not rub against the feet like fibre sometimes does. And the single, reflective orange stripe at the back is playful, and also useful during night runs.

My only disappointment with the design is that the skeletal heel-frame has already started losing colour in two weeks of rugged use. That’s poor performance for an ace running shoe that doubles up as a dope sneaker.

Performance (5/5)

The UB19 packs the most responsive cushioning I have ever experienced in a pair of shoes. And its uniformly stretchy PrimeKnit is great for long-distance running. Along with the Asics Gel-Nimbus 21, it has been my go-to running pair for some time now. But a few kilometres shy of completing a hundred in the pair, I have been longing for a few improvements. And surprisingly, the UB20 fixes most of them.

The legendary Boost midsole is noticeably more concentrated and perhaps slightly trimmed. It feels a bit like the Boost HD midsole of the Pulseboost HD — a very versatile pair currently available on discount for Rs 8,339 — but more premium. It’s still very responsive but less cushioned, something most runners I exchange notes with had hoped for.

The stretchy upper and the wide toe box still make my broad feet happy, but what I absolutely love in the UB20 is that new PrimeKnit feels less stiff around the vamp while a tailored double-stitch reinforces the edges around the toe box. It eases the strain during sharp turns and protects the foot from abrasions.

Verdict (4.5/5)

The cushioned yet rugged Ultraboost, which can clock more miles than most pairs without showing signs of weakness, has been tweaked to perform even better. At 300 grams a piece, it’s not the lightest of running shoes, but the UB20 for Rs 18,999 will take you the distance and last you very nearly a lifetime. Just what the distance runners ordered.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/lifestyle/ultraboost-20-at-300-grams-each-these-running-shoes-are-not-the-lightest-120010400027_1.html,Business Standard,Lifestyle,True

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was told by advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner who had sought probe into the alleged paper leak and scrapping of the exam, that as per the CBI report the paper was leaked and there were other malpractices also.

Bhushan told the bench, also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant, that CBI has chargesheeted the person who was custodian of the paper and had allegedly leaked it in lieu of illegal gratification.

""We will leave the matter to be dealt with by the criminal court. Your argument is that the whole examination should be cancelled. That we are reluctant to do,"" the bench said.

Bhushan argued that CBI has said that it was not possible to identify each and every candidate who may have benefitted from the malpractices in the examination, which included remote access for computers which were used for online exam.
