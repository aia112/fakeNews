0,['Analysis John Harwood'],How Trump's presidency has played for Russia,"But you don't need James Bond to recognize the fact that more than any other modern American president, Trump has delivered some of what the Kremlin values most.

The issue has returned to center stage over the last month as intelligence officials update Congress on Russia's stance toward this year's campaign. Different intelligence briefers have offered alternative assessments of whether Russia favors Trump for the presidency, as it did in his 2016 battle against Hillary Clinton.

Trump and his aides insist a 2020 bias toward him wouldn't make sense anyway. ""We've been very tough on Russia,"" national security adviser Robert O'Brien told a television interviewer last month.

In some specific ways, the administration has indeed been ""tough."" Trump has imposed new sanctions against Russian misbehavior, though reluctantly and under congressional pressure.

His Pentagon sent two aircraft carrier strike groups into the Mediterranean Sea last year to deter Russian aggression. Trump gave Ukraine lethal aid in its war with Russia.

""If you look at administration policy, it's not all that bad,"" said Steven Pifer, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine, of the Trump administration's Russia policy.

Yet those steps represent the smaller part of the story.

The larger part is how Trump has advanced what some experts say are Russian President Vladimir Putin's higher-level objectives: dividing the United States internally, eroding solidarity with European allies, reducing the projection of American power abroad and thereby enhancing the 21st century influence of a diminished Russian state.

Trump, who privately sought a Moscow real estate project as a 2016 candidate, frames his presidential strategy as ""America First."" It envisions friendlier relations with Russia as helpful in resolving thorny foreign policy problems while he secures more favorable economic terms from longtime allies.

But Russia policy specialists see important benefits for Moscow.

After winning in 2016, Trump disdained the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia intervened on his behalf. That buttressed Moscow's attempt to disavow culpability.

Trump has assailed not just Democratic adversaries but also nonpartisan institutions such as the judiciary and the Federal Reserve, eroding public confidence in the American system itself. He has attacked executive branch officials serving under him as a hostile ""deep state."" The lagging federal response to the coronavirus highlights the consequences of his governance.

Pressed by one interviewer in 2017 on his expression of respect for Russia's president, Trump defended Putin by yielding the moral high ground on which his predecessors staked the claim of American exceptionalism.

""You think our country's so innocent?"" he asked.

Steve Hall oversaw US intelligence in countries of the former Soviet Union before retiring from the CIA in 2015 and is a CNN national security analyst. He says Putin wants a weakened US and Trump ""is currently the person on the political horizon who does the best job of that for him.""

Trump sapped Western unity by slapping trade tariffs on allies in the name of ""national security."" He became the first US President in the 70-year history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to cast doubt on America's commitment to defend member states from outside attacks by Russia or other adversaries.

Trump discusses security commitments in commercial terms, suggesting they remain contingent on financial concessions from allies. Uncertainty about the protective US umbrella rattles allies to Moscow's benefit.

""Every time the President says, 'Gee, they haven't paid 2% and maybe we won't support them,' Putin thinks that's good,"" Pifer said. ""You measure power in relative terms. This is the advancement of Russian power.""

""If you give Putin the choice -- destroy NATO but live with Ukraine getting arms -- he'd take it,"" added Duke University scholar Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser to President George W. Bush. Trump's equivocation leaves his subordinates to reassure NATO of American resolve.

Trump's abrupt announcement of troop withdrawals from Syria last year alarmed even staunch Republican supporters. The decision, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned, ""would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime"" in Damascus.

And the President undercut his own signature ""tough-on-Russia"" initiative in the episode that led to his impeachment. He delayed military aid while pressuring a newly elected Ukrainian leader to announce investigations of what he called ""corruption.""

One sought negative information about potential Democratic election rival Joe Biden. Another concerned whether Ukraine rather than Russia actually intervened in the 2016 election -- a notion Trump's former National Security Council official Fiona Hill calls a Russian propaganda fiction.

Lately the 2020 landscape Moscow confronts has changed significantly.

Just two weeks ago, the front-runner to oppose Trump was Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-styled ""democratic socialist"" who shares Trump's skepticism about projecting American military power abroad.

Now, Biden's emergence presents an option more like that in 2016, pitting Trump's record against a more traditionally adversarial approach to US-Russia relations.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/69JHJ-ccCVY/index.html,CNN,World,True
1,['Paul Gittings'],Tokyo 2020 Olympics: Japanese PM Abe insists Games to go ahead as planned,"(CNN) Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe insisted Saturday that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer as planned despite growing fears about the viability of staging the Games amid the global coronavirus pandemic.

With a string of global sporting events being halted in a response to the crisis, Abe has moved to dampen speculation that the Games, due to take place from July 24 to August 9, could be postponed, or even canceled.

""We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned,"" Abe told the news conference in Tokyo, but added the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would have the final decision whether Tokyo 2020 takes place.

His comments came after Tokyo 2020 organizers announced that the Greek leg of the Olympic torch relay had been canceled, but also insisted the Games would go ahead on schedule.

2,['Luke Mcgee'],Coronavirus is Boris Johnson's worst nightmare,"London (CNN) The outbreak of the novel coronavirus is causing political misery for some of the most powerful people on earth. It has, however, left one world leader in a uniquely difficult position.

Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, is having to deal with this public health emergency at the same time a clock is ticking on the United Kingdom's next Brexit deadline: July 1. This pending deadline is far more significant than anything that has happened in the Brexit process to date.

The UK is currently in a transition period with the European Union, set to expire on December 31. The point of this transition was to maintain a standstill in relations between the EU and the UK after Brexit happened on January 31, so to avoid an economic cliff edge.

The two sides are currently negotiating their future relationship and hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before the end of the year. If they can't, then the UK leaves the transition period with no formal agreement on trade or any other strategic areas. The joint decision to scrap next week's round of talks will lead to fears that such an agreement cannot be done in time.Legally, the transition period can be extended, but it would have to be done before July 1 of this year. That's the point of no return.

Until the transition period ends, the UK is playing by EU rules and paying money for the privilege, but with no seat at the tables of power in Brussels. In other words, it is still essentially an EU member state, but with zero influence on EU policy.

JUST WATCHED Here's what you need to know about Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Here's what you need to know about Brexit 03:38

Naturally, this is an uncomfortable position for long-standing Brexiteers -- not least Johnson himself, who led the successful leave campaign in 2016. So, it's hardly surprising that the official position of the British government is that Johnson will not request an extension under any circumstances.

However, that stance was decided before the nation was gripped by coronavirus panic.

""However politically painful it might be for the government, the impact of the coronavirus will reach far beyond the public health implications and into the heart of our economy,"" says Wes Streeting, an opposition Labour lawmaker. ""In good times, leaving the EU on the timetable announced by the government would be a challenge. Trying to stick to that timetable purely for political reasons would be irresponsible.""

The UK is already living some of those implications. Panic-buying has led to shortages of many everyday household products, most notably toilet paper. And if you think empty shelves are a problem now, consider this: according to the Confederation of Paper Industries, the UK imports about 60% of the materials used to make tissue products from the EU. And up to 55% of that demand is for toilet paper.

Some in Brussels wonder if a time will come when experts advising Johnson tell him that, given the scale of the coronavirus problem, refusing to extend the transition period and throwing trade links and supply chains out the window is a bad idea. And if trade talks with the EU slow because of coronavirus, meaning that nothing has been agreed come June, can Johnson really risk food, medicine and other shortages for the sake of saving face?

""Now that future relationship talks are being interrupted, it is inevitable that both sides will have to start considering possible extensions,"" says Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska at the Centre for European Reform, based in Brussels.

However, she adds: ""The request should come from the British government and, obviously, an extension wouldn't come without costs for the UK. Questions, including the financial contributions, will have to be taken. There is no such thing as a free lunch.""

While Brussels might already be thinking about this, the unknown is what Johnson would actually do if he were given the advice to request an extension. And European officials are increasingly convinced that Johnson is still in denial about how serious things could get.

An EU diplomatic source tells CNN: ""It doesn't seem to have sunk in entirely just how different supply chains will look after the transition. Right now, there are hangers full of food sat in ports across Europe. If someone calls at 7 a.m., they can be in British shops that afternoon. The UK imports the vast majority of its toilet paper, so if you kill supply chains you are literally in the s***.""

Two issues collide

Johnson has made a point during the coronavirus outbreak of stressing that the government is making decisions based on the advice it is getting from medical experts. It's certainly true that Johnson has placed his most senior public health officials front and center in recent weeks. Sources close to Downing Street claim that this approach is being driven by Dominic Cummings, Johnson's most senior adviser.

Cummings is known to be obsessed with scientists, data and evidence, so it stands to reason that he would ask government advisers not to brief and encourage the PM to take his cues from the experts. However, this is the same Dominic Cummings who is driving Johnson's Brexit agenda and is thought to have been behind the decision to say publicly that there would be no extension under any circumstances.

So, what will happen when these two distinct issues collide? There is no question that requesting an extension would be very difficult and embarrassing for Johnson. ""If he doesn't want an extension then it's fine, but if he wants one, they [The EU] will have him over a barrel on fishing and financial contributions,"" says Hugo Dixon, referring to two of the thorniest issues currently blighting negotiations. ""It's not just that he will have to go back on his word of no extension under no circumstances, he will have to bite those two bitter pills.""

Exactly how damaging requesting an extension could be for Johnson would have to be weighed against the fallout of no deal, or a very limited trade deal. ""It's entirely possible that the UK suffers a recession in the coming months because of coronavirus, only to then have another recession because of Brexit,"" says Dixon.

While back-to-back recessions would seem difficult for any leader to ride out, Brexit has done weird things to the UK's domestic politics. As the diplomatic source explains: ""Johnson has already laid the groundwork domestically to frame no deal as a fight against EU colonialism versus the UK being able to do what it wants.""

Dixon believes that this could be the easiest political option for Johnson. ""He could bite all the bullets at once and try to ride it out before 2024, when we are out the woods and he can fight an election.""

For the time being, no deal with Europe seems to be the logical endpoint. Dmitry Grozoubinski, founder of explaintrade.com, says that while the Covid-19 crisis could ""focus minds on the need to find a compromise,"" it could also ""rob the negotiations of all political attention, removing any pressure from politicians to back off their currently irreconcilable red lines and leading to a WTO-Brexit crashout largely on autopilot.""

It seems likely when you consider that the EU's patience for British politics wore thin ages ago. ""We are moving to the stage where we don't really care, whatever they do,"" says the diplomatic source.

And while the source believes that the coronavirus gives Johnson ""a way out if he does want to delay for a year,"" they point out that it ""has to come in June -- legally, that is the deadline.""

However, some hold onto the slim hope that the evidence becomes so compelling Johnson has to listen. Gostyńska-Jakubowska points out that when Johnson drew his red lines, ""we didn't have Covid-19. This might encourage the British government to listen to business more carefully."" And Dixon reminds us that Johnson has form for folding when the need for an agreement with Brussels is great: ""The EU won't have forgotten that he essentially gave them everything they wanted last October.""

Both Johnson and the EU are currently close to capacity dealing with the coronavirus crisis. And as the July 1 deadline races up on Johnson, he is likely going to face pressure to consider extending the Brexit transition to avoid economic catastrophe. ""Short-term political pain for Boris is a price worth paying when compared with the medium to long-term risks of getting something like this badly wrong,"" says Streeting.

The great unknown is whether Johnson -- and Cummings -- can be convinced that the risk of going beyond the point of return this summer is really bad enough to perform what would be a staggering U-turn. And though we might not know what they think now, we won't have to wait long to find out.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/iXILuoMKNZQ/index.html,CNN,World,True

4,"['Julia Horowitz', 'Cnn Business']",Here's what could really sink the global economy: $19 trillion in risky corporate debt,"London (CNN Business) Companies have spent the years since the global financial crisis binging on debt. Now, as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to push the world into recession , the bill could come due — exacerbating damage to the economy and feeding a meltdown in financial markets.

Looking to take advantage of low interest rates , companies have rushed in recent years to issue bonds whose proceeds could be used to grow their businesses. Corporate debt among non-banks exploded to $75 trillion at the end of 2019, up from $48 trillion at the end of 2009, according to the Institute of International Finance.

As the coronavirus spreads — touching off a plunge in oil prices and a collapse in travel, and shutting factories from Italy to China — there is increasing alarm that companies in the energy, hospitality and auto sectors won't be able tomake their bond payments. That could trigger a spree of ratings downgrades and defaults that would further destabilize financial markets and compound the economic shock.

""This certainly is another match being lit [near] the bonfire of corporate debt liabilities,"" said Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics. ""There's definitely potential for systemic risk.""

The coronavirus shock

Investors became increasingly anxious about corporate debt this week as stocks sold off and crude prices nosedived. The ability to buy or sell securities in corporate debt markets has become much more difficult. And the extra returns that investors are demanding to hold corporate debt over more stable government bonds have shot up, signaling that they're now viewed as much riskier holdings.

SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK Thedropped more than 6% this week, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF fell more than 8%. Bank of America told clients on Friday that volatility had skyrocketed and outflows from corporate bond funds were at record highs.

The anxiety is pegged to companies that rely on stable energy prices and tourism to generate cash. When business gets tougher for these firms, it could prevent them from servicing their debt, leading to defaults. Ratings agencies could also start downgrading many of these companies, forcing some bondholders to sell.

""Default and downgrade risks have increased to their highest levels since the start of the current business cycle,"" Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist at Goldman Sachs, told clients this week.

Much of the risk lies with energy companies, which have ramped up borrowing in recent years to build pipelines and fund other projects. Those companies now face acute pressure due to plummeting oil prices, which have dropped 50% since early January amid evaporating demand for fuel and the implosion of an alliance between major energy producers Saudi Arabia and Russia that had helped prevent oil from flooding onto global markets.

""Oil producers who were depending on the higher prices to pay back their loans so they could drill for oil are under a significant amount of stress,"" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a consultancy based in Houston.

Chesapeake Energy CHK Whiting Petroleum Corporation WLL Investors dumped shares this week in two US energy companies that Morgan Stanley said are at risk of default within the next year:and. Chesapeake's stock fell to 15 cents on Thursday, while Whiting shares closed at 75 cents.

Airlines, hotels and cruise lines are also in trouble as restrictions on movement grow and more people hunker down at home. A ban on travel from Europe to the United States, announced by the Trump administration on Wednesday, eviscerated airline shares. Budget carrier Norwegian Air, which is heavily indebted, said it would temporarily lay off up to half its workers after its stock dropped 22% on Thursday.

American Airlines AAL Alaska Air ALK ""Coronavirus' rapidly increasing effect on air travel is placing downward pressure on global airline credit profiles, especially as there are risks that demand takes materially longer than previous shocks to recover,"" Fitch Ratings said Thursday. It is monitoring, which has a significant amount of debt, as well as, which is based in Seattle, the site of a significant outbreak in the United States.

A flight arrival information board displays cancelled flights at an airport in Japan.

Automakers are under the microscope, too, as factories in Italy shut down, with more potential closures looming across Europe and in the United States as the number of infections rises in those areas. The industry was already in its third year of a sales recession because of falling demand for vehicles and the US-China trade war.

Who holds the debt?

With the risk of downgrades and defaults growing, the focus for investors then turns to who holds those liabilities, which could rapidly lose their value.

Banks are less exposed to risky corporate debt than they were to bad mortgages in 2008, according to Capital Economics' MacAdam. But that doesn't mean there isn't potential for a corporate debt crisis to reverberate through the financial system.

One issue is the growing number of corporate bonds that are rated BBB, at the very low end of the spectrum of what is considered ""investment grade"" debt. If those bonds get downgraded to high-yield or ""junk"" status, investment funds could be forced to dump them based on their mandates. That could further stress the market and cause liquidity to dry up.

In 2011, corporate bonds rated BBB made up about a third of the market, according to Capital Economics. Today, such bonds account for nearly half of it.

Lots of debt issued by energy companies fits that description. An estimated 67% of investment grade debt issued by energy companies is rated BBB, compared to 50% overall, according to Morgan Stanley. And $34 billion of BBB-rated energy debt is already on negative credit watch from one or more ratings agencies.

Plus, so-called ""shadow banks"" — or financial entities that face far less regulation than traditional lenders — have snapped up large amounts of corporate liabilities. A decade of persistently low interest rates has pushed down yields on safer government bonds, encouraging private equity firms, hedge funds and even pension funds to buy riskier assets with higher returns.

""As the economic cycle matures and investors have picked all the low-hanging fruit — the good, solid investments that give a solid return and aren't too risky — you're naturally going to be looking for riskier and riskier things that years ago you wouldn't have touched with a barge pole,"" MacAdam said.

Emre Tiftik, director of global policy initiatives at the Institute of International Finance, said it's difficult to determine just how vulnerable these players are.

""We really don't know that much about private equity and hedge fund exposure,"" he said.

Seeding systemic risk

In its most recent financial stability report, the International Monetary Fund raised the alarm about piles of risky corporate debt, which it said could amplify problems and deepen the next recession.

The group conducted a stress test based on a hypothetical economic shock that's half as severe as the 2008 global financial crisis. The results suggested that corporate debt worth $19 trillion from eight countries — China, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and Germany — is at risk of default in a future downturn of that magnitude because companies would struggle to generate enough cash to meet repayments. That would be 40% of all corporate debt.

A wave of defaults, or even a series of rating downgrades and repricing, would shake the financial system.

""The credit market is moving quickly towards the point of no return, where the turn in the credit cycle becomes inevitable and irreversible, as funding sources dry up, issuers face liquidity crunch, credit losses rise, investors rush for the exit, and face extremely thin liquidity on the way out,"" Oleg Melentyev, head of high-yield credit strategy at Bank of America, told clients Friday.

And while this is a standard end to a credit cycle, Melentyev said, it appears to be playing out at three to four times normal speed.

Should the situation deteriorate further, it will also have economic consequences as companies hurry to reduce their debt burdens, the IMF noted. There could be waves of layoffs, and business investment could fall off. Defaults would also hit banks and could lead to less lending. Companies could find it more difficult to borrow during the period when they need it the most.

This would exacerbate a global recession caused by the coronavirus, which a growing number of economists now warn is a real possibility.

The expectation is that if the world does tip into recession, it would be sharp but short, with the global economy bouncing back as soon as the threat of the virus recedes. But credit risk in the system incorporates a big question mark.

7,"['Kathryn Vasel', 'Cnn Business']",How to work from home without losing your sanity,"(CNN) Workers throughout the country are finding themselves working from a new office : their homes.

As coronavirus continues to spread throughout the country, companies are asking employees to work remotely to help control contagion.

At first, working from home might seem like a dream: no commute, no distracting co-workers and think of all those chores you'll be able to sneak in!

But after the novelty wears off, things get real. It can be lonely . Your home suddenly feels a lot smaller. And there's no real end to your work day.

""I think the biggest thing that is underestimated is the psychological impact of being alone,"" said David Hassell co-founder and CEO of 15Five, a performance management software provider, where 40% of the workers are remote.

Here are some tips to stay well-balanced:

Take a break

Let's be honest: You don't work eight hours straight in the office. There are coffee breaks, lunch walks and chats with co-workers that give some respite from work.

Just because you are working from home doesn't mean you aren't entitled to the same breathers.

""There is a tendency to work throughout the day to overcome some stigma that you aren't working when not in the office,"" said David Rabin, vice president of global commercial marketing at Lenovo.

Hitting the pause button throughout the work day can be a boon to productivity.

""It's not going to take anything from your effectiveness,"" said Julie Morgenstern, an organization and productivity consultant and author of ""Organizing from the Inside Out."" ""Stepping away for breaks are part of productivity; they actually make you smarter and give you perspective and answers.""

Get structured, but not too much

It will take a little time to get into your groove working from a different environment.

If you were the office worker who liked to bounce around from your desk to a conference room table to a private meeting room to get your work done, don't feel like you have to limit yourself to one spot in your house, advised Rabin.

But be thoughtful about where you choose to work and make sure to match the environment to the type of work you are doing, suggested Morgenstern. For instance, find a quiet area to work for some deep thinking, while sitting outside on your patio might work to respond to emails and other housekeeping-type tasks.

And make sure to designate some places as work-free zones.

""You should preserve some spaces in your home that you never do work in,"" she added. ""It is very hard to relax at night when you start to associate those spaces with work.""

Repurpose your commute

A major perk of working from home is ditching the commute. But that doesn't mean your work day can start earlier.

""Use your commute time in the morning for self-renewal or family time, not work,"" recommended Morgenstern.

Set very clear boundaries

""Working from home doesn't mean you are working more hours,"" warned Morgenstern. Be clear with your manager and coworkers of your schedule and stick to it.

And when your work day ends, put away your work equipment and change into your evening or lounge clothes to help signal the shift to personal time.

You also have to be clear with the other members of your household who might be wanting your attention during the workday. This could be particularly challenging if schools close.

""Create some structure to the day and designate play and work time while organizing space into work and play areas, recommended Morgenstern. ""You have to impose some order.""

Show your face

When possible, use video over the standard conference call to help create more interactions and avoid loneliness.

Three times a week all the employees at 15Five, whether they work from home or are in the office, get on a video call, for an all-hands meeting.

""We can see everyone's faces since everyone is on their own laptop with their own camera -- that is really important,"" said Hassell.

Force social collisions

Working from home means no popping into your colleague's office to chat or running into someone on your way to the bathroom and discussing weekend plans.

""When those drive-by connections are missing,"" said Morgenstern, ""If you are energized by being around other people, it can be despairing.""

But social interaction can still happen from home -- you just have to be more proactive. Set up regular check-ins with your team or manager that allows you to not only provide progress updates, but also sort through any problems or brainstorm ideas.

Use FaceTime, Zoom and other video tools during meetings or just to chat with coworkers to help avoid loneliness.

At 15Five, there are two Slack channels that provide a discussion space for workers.

One is more formal where people discuss what they are working on and other business-related subjects while the other one, called ""water-cooler,"" is more casual, where people post more personal messages and funny images.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/fHnZBEs2rZA/index.html,CNN,World,True
8,"['John Defterios', 'Cnn Business']",Why oil prices are crashing and what it means,"London (CNN Business) Oil prices have suffered their biggest fall since the day in 1991 when American forces launched air strikes on Iraqi troops following their invasion of Kuwait.

Monday's crash spooked markets that were already freaking out about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy and demand for oil. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, were down 22%, last trading at $35.45 per barrel. US oil is trading at $33.15 per barrel, a decline of nearly 20%.

Here are five things you need to know:

Why are oil prices crashing?

Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, launched a price war over the weekend. The move followed the implosion of an alliance between the OPEC cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia.

The kingdom and Russia came together to form the so-called OPEC+ alliance in 2016 after oil prices plunged to $30 a barrel. Since then, the two leading exporters have orchestrated supply cuts of 2.1 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia wanted to increase that number to 3.6 million barrels through 2020 to take account of weaker consumption.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin, worried about ceding too much ground to American oil producers, refused to go along with the plan and his energy minister, Alexander Novak on Friday signaled a fierce battle to come for market share when he said countries could produce as much as they please from April 1.

Why did Saudi launch a price war?

Simmering differences over how best to manage global oil markets spilled into the open at a meeting between OPEC and Russia in Vienna on Friday. After Russia said it was ditching the alliance, Saudi Arabia warned it would live to regret the decision, sources who attended the meeting told CNN Business.

The oil price war follows a rift between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, over how best to balance world energy markets.

Moscow had become tired of cutting production to stabilize prices and felt that the policy of supply restraint gave more room for US shale companies to grow. Mikhail Leontiev, a spokesperson for Russian state oil company Rosneft, described the OPEC+ deal as ""masochism.""

""By yielding our own markets, we remove cheap Arab and Russian oil to clear a place for expensive US shale oil and ensure the effectiveness of its production,"" he told Russian state media on Sunday.

America has become the number one oil producer in the world and is expected to pump about 13 million barrels a day in the first quarter of this year.

Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia decided to fight for greater market share by slashing the prices its preferred customers pay by between $4-$7 a barrel. The kingdom is also reportedly planning to lift production to over 10 million barrels a day.

What does coronavirus have to do with all of this?

The coronavirus has undermined energy demand worldwide, but especially in China, which is now the number one importer of crude oil, guzzling roughly 10 million barrels a day.

Factories have been idled and thousands of flights canceled around the world as the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, has become a global pandemic.

The International Energy Agency said Monday that it expects demand will contract this year for the first time since the recession in 2009 that followed the global financial crisis.

Which countries will be hurt the most?

A price war in the face of collapsing demand is not a recipe for oil stability.

It is difficult to see any winners: the major oil producing countries will lose money regardless of the market share they can claw back. Russia claims to be the most insulated to lower prices because its annual budget is based on an average price of roughly $40 a barrel. US sanctions have forced it to become more efficient.

The Gulf countries produce oil at the lowest cost — estimated at $2-$6 a barrel in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates — but due to high government spending and generous subsidies for citizens, they need a price in the range of $70 a barrel or higher to balance their budgets.

Oil dependent states that have suffered from years of conflict, uprisings or sanctions will pay the heaviest price. Iraq, Iran, Libya and Venezuela all belong in that category. But the United States won't escape either. The shale oil boom has brought with it an economic windfall for some states, and low prices will hurt oil companies.

Will it have an impact on consumers?

Big importing nations such as China, India and Germany could get some much needed relief from falling energy bills.

And consumers benefit in general from lower oil prices and the resulting decline in gas prices at the pump, especially in the United States where retail markets react more directly to supply and demand. Taxes and surcharges make up a higher share of pump prices in Europe, so the effect is less marked.

But any reduction in gas prices will likely be outweighed by the dislocation to the economy caused by the coronavirus led slowdown in global growth.

Then there's the impact this price war will have on US oil producers and energy jobs in states such as Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico and North Dakota, who have enjoyed a boom over the last decade.

9,"['Laura He', 'Cnn Business']",China boasts massive car and aviation markets. Both collapsed in February,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) China's automotive and aviation industries suffered historic drops in activity in February as the government locked down cities and restricted travel to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Car sales in China collapsed 79% compared to a year ago, according to data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Thursday. It was the biggest ever monthly decline, according to Reuters . Only 310,000 vehicles were sold.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include electric or plug-in hybrid cars, plummeted 75% to 12,908, even though the government has been pushing hard for the adoption of such cars.

The country's aviation regulator also released dire figures, saying that the industry recorded its worst financial performance ever in February. Passenger traffic plummeted 85% from a year earlier to 8.3 million people, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Cargo traffic decreased 21%.

Flights are still struggling. Only 40% of domestic flights had resumed by Sunday, according to the regulator.

10,"['Nell Lewis', 'Cnn Business']",How India's Silicon Valley is using tech to tackle traffic,"London (CNN) Imagine being stuck in traffic for 243 hours , equivalent to just over 10 days. Rush hour commuters in Bangalore, a city in southern India, spent around that time in traffic last year.

The city has the worst congestion in the world, according to the 2019 TomTom Traffic Index , overtaking Mumbai, which held the title for the previous two years.

Bangalore's rapid expansion as India's tech capital is partly responsible. The number of cars on the roads has rocketed from 1.4 million in 2000 to more than 8 million in 2019.

But tech could also provide the solution, as startups have sprung up to break the gridlock.

Take Bounce , a Bangalore-based scooter-hire company with a fleet of more than 17,000 electric and gasoline vehicles in its home city. Customers can rent a scooter via its app for as little as 14 rupees (19 cents) an hour.

Founded in 2014, Bounce now operates in more than 30 cities in India with both a docked and dockless model, where you can pick up or drop off the bike anywhere in the city. It claims more than 120,000 rides are taken on its scooters in Bangalore every day.

In January, the startup received a fresh $105 million in funding, taking its overall capital to more than $200 million, Varun Agni, its CTO and co-founder, tells CNN Business. This led to its latest public valuation of $500 million, he adds.

While the initial motivation behind Bounce was ""democratizing the commute"" and providing affordable access to mobility for all, one major byproduct has been a reduction in traffic, says Agni.

Four in 10 users start or end at a subway station, he says. ""This has a massive impact on reducing traffic and congestion,"" as it encourages people to use public transport rather than using a car for the whole trip, he adds.

It also has an impact on the environment, especially as the company introduces more electric scooters to its fleet; by the end of the year, at least half of its vehicles will be electric, says Agni.

Cutting cars and carbon emissions

Quick Ride , a carpooling company also founded in Bangalore, aims to create a sustainable commuting option while cutting the number of vehicles on the roads, reducing fuel consumption and minimizing CO2 emissions, the company tells CNN Business.

It estimates it has saved 90,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions since its founding in 2015, equivalent to that emitted by 19,000 passenger vehicles in one year.

Using its app, drivers connect with passengers on the same route and fill their empty car seats. Quick Ride's system allows them to share the cost of the journey using fixed per-kilometer charges and it manages the payments through user accounts, removing the need for cash exchanges.

It operates in nine cities across India with a total of 3.5 million users, almost a third of which are based in Bangalore. The company says it has raised a total of $15.5 million in funding.

Heavy traffic in Bangalore.

Capgemini CAPMF Companies including consulting firmhave partnered with Quick Ride to encourage employees to carpool, as part of their corporate sustainability strategy.

More than 70% of employees signed up to Capgemini's #CAReToShare campaign in 2019, and since the start of the program in 2017 they have clocked up more than 33 million kilometers in carpool journeys, the company says.

""This program was launched with the dual objective of making the daily commute for our employees more convenient, while trying to ease the pollution plaguing our cities,"" Vijay Chandramohan, senior director of India's corporate real estate services for Capgemini, tells CNN Business.

""Cities in India are growing at an exponential rate,"" he says. ""There is tremendous pressure on the city roads, leading to increasing traffic snarls and commute time resulting in frustration and loss of productivity.""

11,['Amy Chillag'],US cities are losing 36 million trees a year. Here's why it matters and how you can stop it,"(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""

""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

12,"['Bill Weir', 'Cnn Climate Correspondent']",Rising seas are turning Miami's high ground into hot property,"Miami (CNN) In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location.""

In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.

And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.

While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.

Even now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.

""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""

The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.

In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are.

Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.

Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.

But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.

They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.

""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""

Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.

""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""

Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.

After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.

Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.

A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.

They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""

She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.

""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.

""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.""

He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.

But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""

A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.

""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""

Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.

""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.

But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.

And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/pbQjkbD_bFk/index.html,CNN,World,True
13,['Stephanie Bailey'],Climate change: How rich people could help save the planet,"(CNN) Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

Spend wisely

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.

""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.

Divestment

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.

Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""

Wealth means power

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.

""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.

""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.

Fund climate research

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.

In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.

""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

Role models

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.

""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.

""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.

""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/Pa_SMoc1110/index.html,CNN,World,True

Last season, Satoshi Kondo's first collection for Issey Miyake was a viral sensation. Replete with helicoptering dresses, skateboarders and floating models, it was hard not to see it as a joyful statement of his arrival as the label's new designer, replacing Yoshiyuki Miyamae after an eight-year stint.

""I was really surprised by the positive feedback and positive response on social media,"" said Satoshi Kondo during the dress rehearsal for his Autumn-Winter 2020/21 show, staged at the Lycée Carnot, a school in Paris. ""That was something I didn't expect at all. I was really thrilled because at the time the Issey Miyake brand didn't have an Instagram account.""

The question this February at Paris Fashion Week was, what would he do to follow that up?

""As a designer I feel like Issey Miyake has always been a brand that focuses on the joy of making, and I think I can bring, as I did last season, the joy that people feel when they really enjoy the clothes they wear,"" he said.

Since establishing the Miyake Design Studio in Tokyo, Issey Miyake has revolutionized what is considered luxury wear -- by pushing beyond Western silhouettes with the introducing of more drape, loose lines and pleating, and by showing that wearability and playfulness can be synonymous with innovation and glamour.

With a habit of promoting-up within the company -- Kondo-san had been at the label for 13 years already -- rather than introducing new leadership from outside, the house of Issey Miyake seems very much a tight-knit family -- albeit a highly creative, industrious one - working towards a common goal. And though he stepped back from daily design duties in 1999, Issey-san and Kondo-san speak regularly.

""There are times when I talk to Mr. Miyake every day, and there are times when I talk to him once or twice a week, but we have always been exchanging ideas""

""It is just casual conversation, but I get advice not only on clothes and design but more generally from Mr Miyake. This restaurant is really good, you should go see this movie, things like that.""

For his sophomore effort, Kondo-san reunited with choreographer Daniel Ezralow, his collaborator from last season, to create a stage show that was more subtle in execution, but still brimming with possibilities.

""It's a message as simple as that, but that's my attitude and my goal as a designer,"" Kondo-san said. ""Issey Miyake has always been a brand that's looking ahead, looking forward.

Perhaps you're just nervous about transiting through a busy airport with other passengers.

Most of us are handling coronavirus-related disruption by staying put, but for those in a travel predicament with dollars to burn, there's an increasingly popular alternative: private jets.

While much of the travel industry has been suffering as the infection spreads globally, the private jet industry has apparently been on a roll.

Alain Leboursier, director of sales at Swiss private jet broker Luna Jets, tells CNN Travel that there's been an ""impressive increase"" in bookings and enquiries from passengers in recent weeks, correlating with heightened concerns surrounding COVID-19.

In February, about 15% of overall requests were related to coronavirus, Leboursier says. That's now doubled to 30%.

""We got around 200 requests [on Sunday] Out of the 200 requests, 60 requests were coming from 'Coronavirus regions',"" adds Leboursier. ""Either people want to escape, or [there is] urgent business that needs to be done today or tomorrow.""

Clients include companies that normally book employees in biz class seats and high net worth individuals concerned about the spread of the virus.

On-demand private jet charter provider PrivateFly have noted an even bigger surge in demand since President Donald Trump announced restrictions on travel from the US to 26 European nations.

According to CEO Adam Twidell, the company are receiving a ""significant number of requests"" from Americans currently in Europe who are seeking to return to the US, as well as those keen to fly from Europe to the UK, which is exempt from the ban at present.

""Overall the inquiries we're getting are from people very concerned to get their families back together as soon as possible, given how rapidly the situation is developing,"" Twidell tells CNN.

""One client is flying her daughter home to the US from University in France, and several of her fellow students (who are also US citizens) are sharing the flight back with her.""

Leboursier says Luna Jet flew out a passenger over the weekend who usually divides her time between Rome and London. When Northern Italy announced unprecedented restrictions on Sunday, she chartered a flight to London right away. The following day, the lockdown was extended to cover the whole country.

Yann-Guillaume Jaccard, CEO and co-founder of Swiss private jet company Simply Jet SA, says he's currently inundated with inquiries regarding routes that have reduced commercial flights.

""Provided we find an aircraft and crew that is willing to do it [...] we do can do flights in and out of China with private jets,"" he says.

And it's not just European operators noticing an uptake. Jerod Davis, chief and managing pilot at US-based Southern Jet, says his aircraft are getting booked up far in advance.

Davis puts this down to a mix of ""common sense reasons and fear"" -- a lot of his clients are older, at higher risk of suffering ill effects if they contract coronavirus.

""They'd rather be on the plane by themselves, rather than with a crowd of people on airlines, and in security lines and all that,"" Davis tells CNN Travel.

US-based Paramount Business Jets echoes Davis. ""We are seeing anywhere from 100% to 300% increases in charter requests depending on the region worldwide,"" says CEO Richard Zaher.

""The requests are coming from private jet clients, government officials, entertainers and sports teams, corporate executives as well as people who normally would not fly private.""

New customers

Those travelers turning towards the private jet market do so for a range of reasons, with one common denominator: they're all able to spend thousands of dollars on the trip.

Operators say they're now servicing customers who would usually take business or first-class options.

""We are seeing a lot of requests from people who normally would not fly private,"" says Paramount Business Jets CEO Zaher.

Zaher gives the example of an older woman who was traveling from the east coast of the US to the west coast and discarded her commercial flight ticket in favor of a private jet.

Yann-Guillaume Jaccard, CEO and co-founder of Swiss private jet company Simply Jet SA “People basically are happy to pay a premium using our service versus commercial aviation to decrease the risk of contracting the virus.”

Another domestic US passenger was on oxygen and opted to travel private due to health concerns.

Twidell, of PrivateFly, says his company has also had requests from passengers keen to avoid exposure to crowded airport terminals or scores of passengers in airline cabins.

""These include a family looking to return home to Chicago, from New York where they have been attending a wedding,"" he says.

""The group includes an older passenger in their late 70s and a young child.

""Another group includes an immuno-compromised passenger, and they are returning home to the US from the Caribbean. In Europe, one flight was for a couple returning to Jersey in the Channel Islands, from Spain. They were keen to avoid making the necessary airline connection in London.""

Luna Jets, meanwhile, assisted a European passenger who canceled all his commercial tickets for the month of March, and decided to fly private instead. The Swiss company also operated several emergency flights out of Italy when the lockdown on the country's northern regions was announced Sunday.

""We're working on a flight for a company working on moving its 50 top employees from northern Italy back to London where they also have an office,"" says Leboursier.

Meanwhile, British private jet company Victor tells CNN Travel that a LA-based studio recently got in touch about arranging an emergency charter flight to transport 50 employees from Tokyo to LA.

Jaccard says some wealthy families from coronavirus ""hotspots"" have opted to relocate to another continent altogether, chartering private jets to up sticks from Europe to South America with the intention on ""staying there until the situation stabilizes.""

""That's a flight profile we don't see on a regular basis,"" says Jaccard. ""We were quite surprised to discover that some people are actually willing to just relocate themselves for an unknown period of time until you have more info and you know how it evolves.""

Private jet users seek solace in the fact that the aircraft's exactly that -- private. There's no battling for arm rests or ending up in close proximity to others. Plus, these flights operate out of small, private aviation terminals, not mass transport hubs.

""It's quite likely that you will be alone when you board your aircraft, you will only have contact with the security agents and the crew, and some airport personnel,"" says Jaccard.

""People basically are happy to pay a premium using our service versus commercial aviation to decrease the risk of contracting the virus.""

Fears aside, medical experts assure CNN Travel that passengers are unlikely to catch coronavirus on board a commercial airplane.

""Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, told CNN Travel last week , reiterating that hand washing is the best prevention.

""You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth,""

Still, for travelers concerned about hygiene -- the idea that private jet companies likely spend longer cleaning their aircraft is comforting.

Private jet companies also say that, like their commercial counterparts, they've stepped up the sanitization process.

""We always clean the airplane, it's a private jet so we always have it looking nice, but did we sanitize every single surface on the airplane before? Let's be honest, no. But now we do,"" says Davis.

Jaccard says Simply Jet SA has evaluated the cleaning products used -- and opted for ""medical grade"" options.

While private jet companies might be more willing to fly in and out of lockdown zones, the aircraft still operate within the same framework, rules and regulations as commercial airplanes.

Flying into a lockdown zone involves a safety assessment and submitting a flight plan to airport authorities, who will send it to health authorities, who pass on a list of requirements.

Air crew are given a full briefing on the route they're flying, the level of risk and the government stance on the destination.

Leboursier says Luna Jets ensures crew maintain good health by adopting a ""no overnights"" policy in lockdown regions and ensuring crew stay on board throughout their time on the ground.

PrivateFly's Twidell says crew members are having their temperatures checked before every flight.

Long-term impact

While private jet companies might be reaping the benefits of an unexpected boom, Davis says he can't help but have a ""weird feeling"" about getting more business because of a global health crisis.

""Obviously we don't want this to continue,"" he says. ""What we hope is this minimizes and goes away pretty quickly.""

Still, Davis acknowledges a long-term benefit could be that individuals who've opted for private jet travel during the crisis will be hooked, and continue to charter jets in the future.

""Once you fly private, you don't really want to go back,"" he says.

British company Victor points out that while there have been ""new requests for evacuation"", there have also been ""cancellations from those avoiding all travel.""

""It's too soon to know to what extent business aviation will be affected,"" says a Victor spokesperson.

The other players express fears that this short-term boom might simply be shielding long-term implications -- after all, if commercial air travel grounds to a halt, so too will private jet travel.

Plus, there's the economic consequences of a potential market downturn

""If everything is down 25% in a couple of months, that means that our clients may have to get rid of some personnel, they might need to close some factories, or they're just going to experience a general decrease in demand for their products over a long period of time,"" says Jaccard.

Luna Jets' Leboursier expresses similar concerns.

""In the long term, to be honest we are petrified -- because as the leader in Europe, if the market goes down, then we will be the most affected,"" he says.

Jaccard, of Simply Jet SA, says his company is also concerned about the future.

""We are always optimistic short term -- of course we are here to try and help where we can to provide alternate travel solutions that can replace all these routes that are not doable anymore,"" he says.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/5nK0QBSgEos/index.html,CNN,World,True
16,['Tamara Hardingham-Gill'],Tourists being kept under coronavirus quarantine at luxury Maldives resort,"(CNN) — While there's no doubt that having your vacation interrupted by a fast-spreading virus that's infected more than 108,000 globally and killed over 3,800 is a major inconvenience, there are surely worse places to be confined than a luxury Maldives resort.

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

Lavish confinement

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

17,['Silvia Marchetti'],Why the last man standing on the coronavirus cruise ship never gave up,"(CNN) — His ship may have been to hell and back, becoming a floating coronavirus-infected prison for passengers quarantined at port in Japan, but when the captain of the Diamond Princess cruise ship became the last person aboard to finally step onto dry land, he looked entirely unruffled by the experience.

If it weren't for the mask on his face, Gennaro Arma, striding purposefully along the dockside in full uniform with hat under arm, might easily have been stepping down from an uneventful trip shuttling passengers from one vacation destination to another.

But those who know him best say the steadfast calm Arma exhibited throughout the ordeal in which more than 700 people on board the ship tested positive for COVID-19 was typical.

It's why, they say, the experienced Italian sailor is now being hailed as a hero at home and abroad.

""He emerged to be exactly how people have renamed him -- 'Fearless',"" Arma's wife, Mariana Gargiulo, tells CNN Travel from her home in Sant'Agnello, a beautiful coastal town south of Naples, where the captain is due to return soon.

""He never had any problems, and I never worried because we were constantly in contact.""

The quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess has been widely criticized for intensifying the risk of infection for those stuck aboard. Many passengers were eventually airlifted out, but not before at least five people had contracted fatal infections.

Nevertheless, Arma apparently proved himself a tireless rock for his passengers and crew during their ordeal and he's been widely praised for helping lift spirits and for setting a noble example of how a captain should deal with adversity.

'My gladiators'

His support for his crew was on display right to the end when he disembarked on March 2, having overseen the final transfer of all passengers either to hospital or a quarantine facility.

He called them ""my gladiators.""

Throughout the quarantine, he also regularly thanked all passengers on board for their patience and perseverance, leaving them notes of encouragement.

Back in Sant'Agnello his friends, family, townsfolk and local authorities are waiting for Arma's return, preparing to throw him a huge homecoming party. The captain tested negative for the virus and is currently in quarantine in Japan.

His wife says the captain's calm and control during the emergency made it easier for passengers to endure being confined to their cabins. It also gave his family a sense of peace and reassurance.

""We talked each day, both by phone and video chat,"" she says. ""I could hear he was calm, that everything was fine, and I could see that he was fine. He never had any problems.

""I could see him on the ship, he was doing well, working. We had the chance to talk a bit about everything, even our family, and not just about the situation on board.""

Arma, according to Gargiulo, is a real sea dog with decades of expertise that led him to travel around the world after he graduated at a prestigious local maritime school.

""He is a man with great sea skills and know-how,"" she adds. ""His main worry has always been the well-being of his passengers. It was a good test.""

As the wife of a cruise liner captain, Gargiulo has come to share and support her husband's job. She says she's ""always been very serene"" even during the past critical weeks.

""After many years, I'm used by now to the fact that he can be away, and far away, for a long period of time.""

Gargiulo says she doesn't know what Arma's next plans will be -- whether he'll take a break or not before heading back to sea. For now, she says she's just focused on seeing him again.

'A true diamond'

His employer, Princess Cruises, has already expressed its gratitude for its captain's efforts.

""Throughout the response efforts on Diamond Princess, Captain Arma was an exceptionally calm, capable, and inspirational leader for everyone on board,"" Princess Cruises president Jan Swartz said in a statement to CNN.

""From his regular daily shipboard updates to his tireless coordination with public health authorities, Princess shoreside operations, and his on-board team, Captain Arma's contributions have been hailed worldwide as a case study in outstanding leadership best practices.

""As he said to his self-proclaimed 'gladiators' onboard -- a diamond is a piece of coal that did really well under pressure, and I believe Captain Arma himself is a true diamond.""

Passengers too have praised Arma's steady leadership and the comfort he showed them through regular messages, updates and even gifts.

""Thank you to [Captain] Gennaro for his announcements and ability to find humor in an unusual circumstance,"" wrote one guest , Au Na Tan, on Twitter.

She added that Arma was ""courageous, sympathetic and carried himself with dignity and optimism for what was an unprecedented and unique situation. Through the entire journey, he sought to bring light to our circumstances and strove to reassure us as much as he could,"" because it's true that only ""a frightened captain makes a frightened crew .""

Arma's wife says his warm and friendly approach to guests is one of his many winning traits and part of his character.

'Symbol of Italy'

""He always takes good care of passengers, he's always had a particular attention for them,"" she says. ""Each day at lunchtime, before they'd start to eat, he wishes them all 'buon appetito' in Italian.

""And then there was the gesture of handing out flowers and chocolates on St. Valentine's Day to passengers shut in their cabins,"" to make them feel better and let them know they've not been abandoned, she says. ""It must have been really hard for them.""

Passengers were thankful for the Valentine gifts and food, posting photos online of what Arma's crew provided them with.

At one point, Arma recited a quote from the Bible to guests on the power of love, taken from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians, to lift spirits and send out a message of faith and resilience.

It's not just those who endured the drama on board who have praised the captain.

His actions have resonated worldwide, especially in Italy where many people have seen him as embodying Italian endurance and the spirit of sacrifice. They've turned to social media to express gratitude and feelings in phrases such as "" proud to be Italian . Grazie!""

Another admirer says he should be ""a mandatory case history for talkative, braggart and cowardly politicians.""

""There are captains and captains,"" reads another post that says Arma's actions would be worthy of inclusion in writer Rudyard Kipling's novel ""Captains Courageous.""

Local Sorrento and Amalfi coast newsrooms have also been flooded with messages from Arma's new fans.

One of them wrote how the captain's efforts make him worthy of ""the same sea waters roamed by Odysseus, Aeneas, Christopher Columbus"" and other great seafarers and mythological heroes.

Matching heroism with humility, Arma's final message to his crew stressed that it was teamwork that pulled them all through.

18,['Patrick Gillespie'],Mexico ready to retaliate by hurting American corn farmers,"Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn.

Mexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today. And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States.

It's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country.

""I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina,"" Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City.

He added: It's a ""good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes.""

American corn goes into a lot of the country's food. In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere.

Related: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us

America is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn. American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada.

American farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data. In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million.

Experts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers.

""If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy,"" says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm.

Rios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats. Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%.

Trump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA. He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true.

Related: Mexico doubles down on Trump 'contingency plan'

Still, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like.

All sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period.

But Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA.

Such tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter. He's not alone. Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond ""immediately"" to any tariffs from Trump.

""It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,"" Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show.

Apple has joined an industry group devoted to wireless charging, strengthening existing rumors that the next iPhone will charge without a cord. The Wireless Power Consortium, which is made up of some 200 organizations that promote a single wireless charging standard, confirmed to CNNTech that Apple joined the group last week.

IPhone rumors swirl months before each new version is announced, and hype around the so-called 'iPhone 8"" is particularly high: Apple (AAPL) is expected to unveil a major redesign of the this fall to mark the 10-year anniversary of the smartphone.

The company has already shown interest in doing away with cumbersome cords. The Apple Watch charges wirelessly, provided consumers spend $79 on a magnetic charging dock. And the latest MacBook now comes with only one USB port.

Apple would also create another iPhone revenue stream by selling a wireless charging station separately. The feature would simplify charging for smartphone owners. Rather than plugging in one's phone, a user would only need to place it on the charging dock.

20,"['Rishi Iyengar', 'Kristie Lu Stout']",How 'America First' could turn into 'India First',"America is great because of its willingness to accept talented immigrants.

That's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity.

""If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent,"" Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.

Infosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas. The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs.

The Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform.

Curbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest.

India is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry. According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians.

Shares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown.

Nilekani said it would be a mistake for the administration to follow through.

""Indian companies have done a great deal to help U.S. companies become more competitive, and I think that should continue,"" Nilekani said. ""If you look at the Silicon Valley ... most of the companies have an immigrant founder.""

India's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized. The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India.

Related: India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas

But Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's ""America First"" plan. If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India.

""This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season,"" he said. ""It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here.""

Nilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example.

The Bangalore-born entrepreneur left Infosys in 2009 to run India's massive social security program, which is known as Aadhaar. As a result of the initiative, the vast majority of India's 1.3 billion citizens now have a biometric ID number that allows them to receive government services, execute bank transactions and even make biometric payments.

""It was built by extremely talented and committed Indians,"" Nilekani said. ""Many of them had global experience, but they brought that talent and experience to solve India's problems.""

Nilekani said the country's massive youth population is increasingly choosing to stay home and pitch in.

21,['Alanna Petroff'],Swiss voters reject corporate tax overhaul,"Voters in Switzerland have shocked the political establishment by rejecting a reform plan that would have brought the country's corporate tax system in line with international norms.

The tax reforms, which were widely supported by the business community, would have removed a set of special low-tax privileges that had encouraged many multinational companies to set up shop in Switzerland.

Experts say the future of Switzerland's tax system is now unclear. The vote result could create headaches for firms that had been banking on their implementation, and deter companies who had been considering a move to the country.

""They do not know what [tax] measures will be available... That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions,"" Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement.

Switzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system. The country runs the risk of being ""blacklisted"" by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019.

Many voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland. That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class.

The current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations. International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies.

Martin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms. The measures were rejected by 59% of voters.

""I think it's a very bad day for Switzerland,"" Naville said. ""Clearly, the uncertainty and the credibility in the Swiss [system] has taken a massive hit.""

22,['Paul R. La Monica'],Stocks hit record again. But is Trump the reason?,"The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 each hit new all-time highs Monday.

Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will continue to thrive.

So is this the Donald Trump rally? Or the Janet Yellen rally?

Some strategists believe Trump's stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring.

Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead?

You could argue that POTUS 44 has dealt POTUS 45 a pretty good hand.

The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident.

But investors (and financial journalists) are often quick to give the president more credit -- and blame -- than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market.

RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday, one that was aptly titled ""Message to Market: It's Not All About Donald.""

Related: Trump isn't killing the bull market

Golub noted that the S&P 500 rose nearly 7% from late June through Election Day -- a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president.

But stocks have continued to rally since then, rising another 8% since Trump pulled off the upset (at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street) victory.

You can't have it both ways. It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didn't lose.

Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won, a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress.

Yet Golub points out that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was going up during the late summer as well.

Of course, many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too.

Yet once again, many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected, but was happening because many thought he would lose.

Related: Stocks have avoided a 1% dive for an unusually long period of time

So it's odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win.

What's really going on? The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve.

Yes. the markets are reacting to Washington. But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen, not the White House.

The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in 2017 regardless of who won the race for president.

The good news for investors is that the U.S. economy seems to be growing steadily, but does not appear to be at risk of overheating.

Related: Here's why the world's largest money manager is worried

The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of 2.5% annually. But that's not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates.

Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year, they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time. That would push the Fed's key short-term rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%.

That's still extremely low. At those levels, stocks would still be more attractive than bonds. Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip. And consumers would probably keep spending.

So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president,

With that in mind, Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. And what she says about the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes could wind up keeping the rally going full steam ahead -- or stopping it dead in its tracks.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/WuHmoPyNDKc/index.html,CNN,International Market,True
23,['Seth Fiegerman'],Apple stock nears record high,"Apple has found its groove again.

The iPhone maker's stock hit $133.82 in early trading Monday, putting Apple less than $1 away from its intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015. Apple's stock ended the day at $133.29, beating its previous record closing price of $133, set in February 2015.

The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL) to a $700 billion market cap, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of ""major new features"" like ""3D sensing"" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney.

Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the ""mother of all upgrades.""

Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year. The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014.

The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand.

Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration'

Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters.

Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits.

But that losing streak just ended.

Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.

The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record. At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes.

Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, ""Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped.""

The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple. There's also President Trump.

Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts.

Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts. If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/TPXuj8i67Q4/index.html,CNN,International Market,True
24,['Patrick Gillespie'],"America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico","America and Canada have one of the world's biggest trade relationships.

President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada,"" Trump said at the news conference.

But the U.S.-Canada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think. There have been trade wars, acts of retaliation, allegations of dumping and jobs lost.

""Our trading relationship obviously is strong...but the relationship has been rocky, despite the agreements we have in place,"" says Stuart Trew, an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa, Canada's capital.

Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA, the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. But Canada is rarely mentioned.

Yet, there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada -- almost all by U.S. companies -- than against Mexico. Even today, Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat.

Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive. But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way.

Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau.

1. Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico

Listening to Trump, you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA. But since NAFTA's inception in 1994, there have been 39 complaints brought against Canada, almost all by U.S. companies. Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements, it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico, Canada, or the U.S.

There's only been 23 complaints against Mexico. (By comparison, companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of 21 complaints against the U.S.)

And increasingly, Canada is the target of American complaints. Since 2005, Canada has been hit with 70% of the NAFTA dispute claims, according to CCPA, a Canadian research firm.

2. The U.S. - Canada lumber battle

NAFTA isn't the only sore area. In 2002, the U.S. slapped a roughly 30% tariff on Canadian lumber, alleging that Canada was ""dumping"" its wood on the U.S. market. Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies 30,000 jobs.

""It was a very sour point in Canadian - American relations for quite a while,"" says Tom Velk, an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The dispute had its origins in the 1980s, when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts weren't playing fair.

Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute.

Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada. American lumber companies still allege that it does, and a U.S. Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in 2004. It didn't say whether the subsidies were ongoing.

According to the allegations, Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from. That subsidy -- on top of Canada's huge lumber supply -- allowed Canada to price its lumber below what U.S. companies can charge.

The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada, denying America's claim and the two sides came to an agreement in 2006 to end the tariff.

However, that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October, and the two sides are back at it again. The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldn't reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with U.S. lumber companies calling once again for tariffs.

3. Smoot-Hawley triggers U.S. - Canada trade war

Things got even worse during the Great Depression. In 1930, Congress wanted to protect U.S. jobs from global trade. So the U.S. slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers.

It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act. Today, it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was.

Canada was furious, and retaliated more than any other country against the U.S., sparking a trade war.

""Canada was so incensed that...they raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new U.S. tariff,"" according to Doug Irwin, a Dartmouth Professor and author of ""Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.""

For example, the U.S. increased a tariff on eggs from 8 cents to 10 cents (these are 1930s prices, after all). Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from 3 cents to 10 cents -- a threefold increase.

Exports dwindled sharply: in 1929, the U.S. exported nearly 920,000 eggs to Canada. Three years later, it only shipped about 14,000 eggs, according to Irwin.

Related: Remember Smoot-Hawley: America's last major trade war

4. Canada's sky high tariffs on U.S. eggs, poultry, milk

Fast forward to today. Smoot-Hawley is long gone, but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on U.S. imports of eggs, chicken and milk.

For instance, some tariffs on eggs are as high as 238% per dozen, according to Canada's Agriculture Department. Some milk imports, depending on the fat content, are as high as 292%.

""They're so onerous that you can't bring it across. There's no American eggs in Quebec,"" says Velk.

According to Canada's Embassy in the U.S., reality is much different. Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs, Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk, poultry and eggs.

The U.S. does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries, but they are not nearly as high as Canada's.

Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some U.S. dairy and poultry farmers, some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market. But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now.

Related: Those Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about

5. COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA

Despite all these disputes, experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world.

In fact, the two countries are so interconnected now, when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against U.S. lawmakers.

For example, Canadian meat producers disputed a U.S. law that required them to label where the cattle was born, raised and slaughtered. Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the U.S. and took the case to the WTO.

The WTO sided with Canada, and last December, Congress repealed the country-of-origin-labeling law. American meat producers -- whose business is intertwined with Canada -- actually supported their counterparts in Canada, arguing the regulation was too burdensome.

As for Trump's proposal of tearing up NAFTA, many American and Canadian experts say that it's not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement. The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth.

25,['Paul R. La Monica'],"Verizon's new plan: Consumers win, investors lose","Verizon has brought back its unlimited data plan. That's great if you're a Verizon customer. But it is terrible news for its investors.

Verizon (VZ) stock fell nearly 1.5% in early trading Monday. It's now down about 10% so far this year, making it the Dow's worst performer of 2017.

Verizon's move is a clear sign the company has to pull out all the stops to remain competitive with wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS).

""In recent months, both T-Mobile and Sprint had some success taking additional share from Verizon by virtue of their unlimited offerings,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report Monday morning.

That may explain why shares of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is now controlled by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, are both up this year while Verizon is down. T-Mobile and Sprint have also been perennially linked as possible merger partners.

But the new telecom price war isn't the only problem for Verizon.

AT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms. Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service.

Related: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans

And AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX). Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings.

But the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years.

Yahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year. It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter.

However, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it ""continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches"" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon.

Verizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous. In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications. And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX).

There also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR).

That may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now. But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days.

Anything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible.

Related: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover

Still, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%. And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends.

Companies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected. Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt.

That's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too. That could push bond yields even higher.

So Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year.

That's why Verizon, nicknamed Big Red because of its logo's crimson hue, may see its stock in the red for the foreseeable future.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/EU3QwX3lIos/index.html,CNN,International Market,True
26,['Ivana Kottasova'],Oil prices have doubled in a year. Here's why,"It's a good day for OPEC.

Data published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production.

The confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016.

The price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions.

Since then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel.

Here's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher:

OPEC deal

OPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices.

The news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%.

Investors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply.

Crucially, the deal has stuck. The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production. The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%.

UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected.

The production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months.

Related: OPEC has pulled off one of its 'deepest' production cuts

Investors upbeat

The OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it. The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC.

The widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases.

Higher demand

The latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year.

Demand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016.

The IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017.

Saudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale

What's next?

Despite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher.

That's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market. The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes. That's 152 more than a year ago.

U.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report.

""This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output,"" said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index.

Uber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers. The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia.

The San Francisco-based company suspended its operations in Taiwan last week, six months after it sold its operations in China to local rival Didi Chuxing. Didi, which is taking the fight to Uber in key foreign markets, is one of Ola's investors.

In India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival. Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities.

Ola also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015.

31,['Sarah Karacs'],This company makes food packaging out of bamboo to cut down on trash,"To tackle Thailand's mounting trash problem, one company is turning to the country's plant life.

Universal Biopack makes packaging that it sells to restaurants and manufacturers. But rather than plastic, it uses a mixture of bamboo and cassava, crops that are widely found across the country.

After growing rapidly in recent decades, Thailand has become one of Asia's biggest economies. But like many other countries in the region, it's been slow to try to combat the millions of tons of trash produced each year.

""Waste management is a big problem everywhere,"" said Universal Biopack's managing director, Vara-Anong Vichakyothin.

Related: The company turning 4 billion plastic bottles into clothes

The company is using a technology devised at a Bangkok university to make its zero-waste packaging. It hopes it will eventually replace many of the Styrofoam boxes and plastic bags that end up in huge garbage dumps across Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.

Its eco-friendly formula took five years to develop and is so adaptable it could end up being used to package things like furniture and even phones. The bamboo it uses comes from leftover scraps from the chopstick manufacturing process.

In the cities of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, where takeout drink containers and noodle packets line the sidewalks, the company supplies restaurants, organic farmers and other businesses in the food and drink industry.

But finding new clients can be tricky.

Takeout food vendors in Thailand want to keep costs down in a competitive business with thin margins. Asking them to spend more on packaging for environmental reasons is a tough sell.

""The local economy still does not support [this technology]"" said Universal Biopack's founder, Suthep Vichakyothin.

But that hasn't stopping other companies from entering the sustainable packaging market in Thailand. Like Universal Biopack, they're betting on growing environmental awareness eventually leading to an increase in demand.

To become more competitive, Suthep's company is investing. It's aiming to ramp up production by building a partially automated assembly line at its factory near Bangkok and doubling its staffing from 50 people to 100.

The goal is to increase monthly capacity from 300,000 units to one million.

32,['Aj Willingham'],Here's how to outsmart fake news in your Facebook feed,"(CNN) Just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true . It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn't have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn't breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit.

It doesn't have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot -- if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.

NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars , an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis , the head of theat the Poynter Institute.

This one is tough, because satire doesn't pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate.

The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information -- which may or may not live up to what was promised.

A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda.

These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren't supported by the information in the article.

These are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real.

First, know the different types of misleading and false news

""People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,"" she told CNN. ""I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn't necessarily mean you're internet savvy.""

Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren't immune to fake content.

""If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we'd go a good way towards combating flasehoods,"" he told CNN.

Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it's important to have a ""healthy amount of skepticism"" and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news.

For starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:

1. Does the story come from a strange URL?

Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like "".co"" or "".su,"" or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales.

2. Does the headline match the information in the article?

Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don't bother to click through.

Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. ""Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to 'Take Their Business Elsewhere',"" trumpeted one such headline.

However, the articles themselves didn't contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi's stock saw a significant drop (it didn't). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump's election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to ""take their business elsewhere.""

3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?

Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney.

A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump's election win. The story quickly caught fire online -- after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry.

It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio -- in 2015 . It had nothing to do with the election results at all.

4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?

Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. ""IT BEGINS,"" read the headline.

However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the ""bathroom bill"" was to be passed.

In fact, according to Snopes , the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy.

5. Does the article cite primary sources?

It's not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral.

One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a ""clear parasite"" was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel

Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found -- because the story is 100% fake.

6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?

A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:

""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""

quote is nowhere to be found in them. This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it : People.com has extensive archives, and thisin them.

7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story?

During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as ""reported"" by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as ""reported"" by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!

In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It's always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop -- or if they all lead back to the same dubious site -- you have reason to doubt.

8. Is your own bias getting in the way?

Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook's algorithm -- the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.

Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence.

""We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,"" says Zimdars. ""If we come into contact with information we don't agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.""

So if you find an outrageous article that feels ""too good to be true,"" use caution: It just might be.

9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization?

you're getting the real deal. View the whole list here. Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know

10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites?

things can get tricky. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. This is where. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars' now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list

While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as ""fake"" is not accurate. ""I want to make sure this list doesn't do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,"" she says. ""It's interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/g8ESQjzCp_Y/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

35,['Sarah Sekula'],Flying a sports car with wings,"Tampa, Florida (CNN) — When it comes to piloting a plane, I have zero experience.

In fact, I've never even considered attempting it.

Nevertheless, as we swoop over Florida's Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.

At 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it's known as a sea light-sport aircraft.

Designed to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there's nothing else quite like it on the market.

Now that I'm in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I'm not entirely sure.

However, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car.

Plus, the fact that Icon's CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn't hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.

So far, so good.

We glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I'm comfortable enough to take in the sights. Lovely Fort De Soto Park doesn't disappoint.

l e v a r t

Squiggles of dreamy white dunes are surrounded by water that looks like it should be in the Caribbean.

The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, with its series of long-spanning cables, is equally impressive.

The adrenaline is still racing. And as most surreal experiences go, it just keeps getting better.

For starters, there's another ICON A5 to my left, which is thrilling in itself. We are flying in formation, and my job is to mimic its movements. You'd think this would be intimidating, but it's not.

It's just plain fun.

That's music to Hawkins' ears. He's the brains behind this newfangled plane, an idea 10 years in the making.

As a former Air Force F-16 pilot and a Stanford Business School grad, he has focused most of his adult life on making sport flying available to the masses.

""The idea for us was to create an airplane where the average human being can go out and experience the world without having the burden of becoming a professional pilot,"" he says.

So it makes sense that the dashboard looks like what you see in your car. There are only a few gauges that I don't recognize.

""It's the Apple approach to things,"" he says. ""You humanize it, and make it intuitive and easy and cool.""

He's so confident people will want to fly (and buy) his planes that he just opened a flight-training facility at Peter O. Knight Airport.

Located on Davis Island, five minutes from downtown Tampa, it's a place where both beauty and sailboats abound.

The company's other training center is in Vacaville, California, where ICON is headquartered.

Wide eyes and open windows

By 9 a.m., it's time for a brief water-landing pitstop.

Hawkins takes over the controls. I've been too busy learning to fly in formation (not something non-pilots get to try very often) and interviewing Hawkins to even think about learning to do a water landing myself. It's something Hawkins tells me most people can master in about 30 minutes.

A few negative-Gs and 360-degree turns later and it becomes a fun roller-coaster ride in the sky. Plus, it's an open-air flight, so I occasionally flop my arms out. Just because I can.

At a few hundred feet above the water, it's easy to spot a boater waving at us, a flock of pelicans and even stingrays.

""We're gonna pull over here and stop and get out for a second,"" he says.

Surely he's kidding, right? But after landing the plane on the water, he takes off his seatbelt, and I realize he's not.

Seconds later, he pops the roof and we climb onto the wings, which could easily double as diving boards. Suddenly, this feels less like a plane outing and more like I'm on a boat sunbathing.

Everything is drenched in a mesmerizing golden hue. I can imagine picnicking on the beach nearby. Or taking the plane somewhere for a remote weekend camping trip.

Because the plane has a range of about 430 miles on a full tank, it's made for short getaways.

""This entire thing is about inspiring people,"" he explains. ""Once you learn to fly, you will never be the same. You will look at the sky different, you will look at the planet different.""

Designed to make flying simple

""The primary motor skills for operating a plane are pretty easy,"" Hawkins tells me. ""We have people landing by themselves with an instructor on their very first day, within 30 minutes.""

That said, they've painstakingly taken the time to design it for safety. The goal of the spin-resistant airframe feature is that if the pilot makes mistakes, the airplane doesn't lose control.

As a backup, there's a complete airplane parachute.

""The spin resistance feature is a big deal as it's the first airplane that the FAA has deemed spin-resistant,"" says Chris Dupin, a flight instructor and US Air Force officer. ""A significant number of general aviation fatalities are from loss of control accidents that involve an unrecovered spin on the base to final turn.""

Plus, there's the angle of attack indicator, something you don't typically see in a light aircraft. It shows you where the wing is happy (in the green) or where it could stall (in the red).

The pilot's job is to keep the wing within the green or yellow section of the gauge. This is part of what makes water takeoffs and landings so easy to learn.

Becoming a barnstormer

""Kirk Hawkins has an extremely creative and innovative idea for pilot training that is more intuitive; teaching the feel of flight first and the principals and structure later, not unlike how people learn to drive,"" says Christine Negroni, veteran aviation journalist and author of ""The Crash Detectives.""

""The world is facing a pilot shortage, so the idea of teaching differently, so that different learning styles can be accommodated could very well expand the pool of pilot candidates.""

On that note, about 40% of the folks who've put down deposits for the ICON A5 are not pilots, which means this plane is drawing aviation newbies.

After an hour and a half of flying time, Hawkins lands us on the airport runway, a maneuver that you can tackle after you've mastered several water landings. It's a bit trickier since it requires more precision and knowledge about crosswinds.

At this point, if I owned this plane, I'd hook it up to a trailer, fold the wings up, drive it home, and park it in the garage.

Get some air time

If you want your own ICON A5, get in line. More than 1,800 customers have put deposits down.

For those who aren't ready to shell out $207,000 to buy one, there's the option of stopping by ICON's training facility in Tampa, or the facility in Vacaville, California, to fly for the day.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/TmUmdkaEi9k/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

39,['Ashley Strickland'],Going to space is a real pain in the back,"(CNN) A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study .

Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission.

Things don't improve when they return to Earth's gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc.

""It's sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,"" said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. ""So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts' backs.""

Like being in a body cast

Much attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang's team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling.

What they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury.

In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren't using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren't bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months.

MRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. ""Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,"" Chang explained.

Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts' potential time spent in Martian gravity -- 38% of the surface gravity on Earth -- creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.

The team's future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.

Yoga in space?

Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine.

In addition to the ""fetal tuck"" position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done.

""A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit.""

Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station.

Scott Parazynski, who walked in space seven times, assisted with construction on the space station in 2007.

Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.

One of Chang's teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity.

Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.

40,['Matthew Chance'],Russian gamers race to prevent nuclear 'war',"(CNN) ""Attention! Attention!"" blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. ""The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.""

Inside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.

Their quest -- the latest craze in Moscow -- is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general.

It's complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.

But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.

A mad Russian general has pushed the nuclear button - and gamers must stop missiles launching

""I'm worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,"" said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.

""I know that normal people all over the world don't want any war,"" he added.

A nation preparing for conflict

But Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia's old Cold War rival.

Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack.

The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill

The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.

Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.

Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction -- or MAD -- still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War.

But with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real.

""I don't think nuclear war is likely,"" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs , a prominent foreign policy journal.

""But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don't have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,"" he told CNN.

Kremlin playing up fears

It is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.

In its flagship current affairs show, Russia's top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev -- dubbed the Kremlin's propagandist-in-chief by critics -- recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.

""Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,"" he declared.

The Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal.

The Satan 2 , as it's known, will be the world's most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia's place as a top nuclear power.

It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow.

""I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,"" said Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer.

""But it sounds ridiculous to me and I'm totally sure that war is impossible,"" she adds.

The quest game players - pretending to be a special ops team - are the only ones who can avert war

Back in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch. The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack.

Hopefully, the real world will be spared such a confrontation too.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/wBGZxsDnWMU/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

They're all landmark Japanese inventions from the 80s and 90s, symbols of an era when the Asian nation was a world leader in tech innovation.

But with the rise of Silicon Valley, and American tech giants such as Google and Apple, has seen Japan produce less era-defining tech over the past two decades.

That, says Professor Masahiko Tsukamoto, of Kobe University's Graduate School of Engineering , is about to change thanks to a new generation of young entrepreneurs, an uptick in international collaborations, and new partnerships with university scientists.

Japan's focus this time around is not on smart phones or gaming, but wearable chairs, smart glasses and dog communication devices.

In short, wacky wearable tech.

Wearable tech in Japan

In 2013, Japan sold 530,000 units of wearable tech devices, according to Yano Research Institute

That figure is predicted to leapfrog to 13.1 million units in 2017.

-- at launch, it was the largest wearable tech fair in the world with 103 exhibitors. Perhaps the best indication of the boom in this industry was the introduction of Tokyo's first Wearable Expo in 2015-- at launch, it was the largest wearable tech fair in the world with 103 exhibitors.

It has featured electronic kimonos, cat communication devices, and electronic gloves to record a pianist's finger work.

At the next show, from January 18 to 20, 2017, the organizers expect more than 200 exhibitors and 19,000 visitors.

""With better functionality, lighter components and smaller designs, wearing devices is now no longer a fantasy,"" says show director Yuhi Maezono. ""Wearables are gathering attention as the next big growth market.""

The dog whisperer

Inupathy is a dog harness slated to launch at the end of this year that will allow pet owners to communicate with their dogs.

As well as a heart monitor, the harness features noise-canceling technology which can isolate the animal's heartbeat and track its reactions to stimulus, such as food, games, people and toys.

With this data, the harness assesses a dog's mood and changes color to inform the owners.

Equipped with six LED lights, the collar glows blue to show calm, red for excitement, and displays a rainbow theme for happiness.

Joji Yamaguchi, CEO of Inupathy, was inspired by his Corgi, Akane, who was a nervous puppy. To better understand the dog's anxiety, the biologist developed Inupathy to monitor his heart rate.

""Buddhism and old Japanese religion says every animals, plants, and even rocks have spirit inside. It's stressful when you can't solve problems that are upsetting them.""

Yamaguchi expects wearable wellness tracking will have applications for humans, too.

""Personalization, of artificial intelligence will be a game-changer,"" says Yamaguchi.

A real life-saver

Archelis -- a wearable chair launched in Japan this year -- is also creating a buzz internationally.

A collaboration between Nitto mold factory, Chiba University, Japan Polymer Technology and Hiroaki Nishimura Design, in Japan, it was initially intended for surgeons, who need to rest their legs during long operations.

The chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.

The Archelis chair.

""The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus' egg,"" says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. ""Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain -- especially for surgeons who are older.""

Made of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries.

The innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.

The system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.

Though the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet.

Get to the point

Other wearables are on the smaller side.

Measuring about 3 inches long, BIRD is essentially a modern thimble that turns your fingertip into a magic wand.

BIRD can control up to 10 devices at a time.

Using algorithms to decode a user's intent, the device also features precise sensors that track direction, speed, and gestures.

The technology enables users to turn any surface into a smart screen, as well as interact with other smart devices.

Walking around at home, users can project a laptop screen onto a wall, switch on a coffee machine, read on any surface, and make online purchases with the point or swipe of a finger.

43,['Susan Scutti'],Cell phones and screens are keeping your kid awake,"For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don't use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.

The analysis found ""a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,"" said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King's College London.

Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.

Few parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a ""strong and consistent association"" between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Surprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.

Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was ""how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,"" many of us will probably recognize our own families' habits reflected in the statistics.

Electronic bedroom

A large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.

According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children's sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game.

Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.

Carter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.

""Sleep is vital for children,"" said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. ""We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more.""

Kansagra, author of "" My Child Won't Sleep ,"" noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. ""It's hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.""

Kansagra said it's possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. ""For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,"" he said.

Practicing good sleep hygiene

Dr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child's healthy development, even though ""we don't know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.""

In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. ""Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,"" said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own ""personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.""

Sleep hygiene -- tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep -- include having a room that is quiet. ""And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,"" Kline said.

One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation , which recommends at least 30 minutes of ""gadget-free transition time"" before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.

Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/grZ2k7Zm__0/index.html,CNN,Tech,True

48,['Aimee Lewis'],With society shutting down will Tokyo 2020 go ahead?,"(CNN) As Covid-19 spreads with alacrity around the world, billion-dollar sports leagues have been brought to a halt.

Thursday in the US was one of the most extraordinary in the country's sports history as the NBA, the WNBA and the much-anticipated NCAA's men's and women's basketball tournaments were among the major events suspended or postponed.

Competitions once regarded as shatterproof have been affected. The English Premier League, often described as the world's richest soccer league, on Friday announced a suspension.

But the Olympic Games , the biggest sporting spectacle of all, is still set to go ahead, which begs the question: with society shutting down as a result of a worldwide pandemic, will the Olympics really be held in Tokyo this summer?

What has been said?

On Friday, Japan's Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto dismissed suggestions that Tokyo 2020 should be postponed.

Responding to comments made by US President Donald Trump, who had suggested the Games should be rescheduled, Hashimoto said neither the local organizing committee or the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had considered postponing or canceling the Games.

""We continue to proceed preparations to hold a safe and secure Games that will open on July 24,"" said Hashimoto.

On March 12, the day the Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia without spectators because of ongoing concerns over COVID-19, the IOC said it was ""fully committed"" to holding the Games, set to run from July 24 to August 9, in Tokyo.

""Nineteen weeks before the opening ceremony of the Games we are strengthened in our commitment by many organizations around the world taking significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus,"" Thomas Bach, the IOC president, said.

Much is still unknown

The coronavirus has infected more than 132,500 people and killed nearly 5,000 globally, according to the World Health Organization.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients, compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza, but much remains unknown about it.

Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared with neighboring South Korea and China. However, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.

The country experienced an uptick in numbers on Tuesday, with 54 more cases reported -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.

And Japan has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak, specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay.

A woman wearing a face mask walks past the Olympic rings in front of the new National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020.

Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the ""tip of the iceberg.""

This week the country canceled the annual public service in Tokyo which marks the Fukushima disaster.

The start of the baseball, football and rugby sevens seasons have already been delayed, while a major sumo tournament that opened in Osaka last weekend was held without spectators for the first time in its history.

With the Games still scheduled to go ahead, the outbreak in Japan and the government's handling of it will continue to be under heightened scrutiny.

What are the options for Tokyo 2020?

If the Games were being held now, it would be difficult to imagine how organizers could go ahead as planned. Thousands of people converging in Tokyo during a pandemic would surely not be countenanced.

But Tokyo 2020 has time. Experts hope warmer weather will help fight the virus, though it is yet unclear whether that theory is true.

The Olympic movement essentially has two opportunities to make money, at the Summer Games and the Winter Olympics, so with billions of dollars at stake, in ticket sales, hospitality and sponsorship especially, organizers are as yet unwilling to contemplate a delay or cancellation.

With the authority to cancel the Games, it is the IOC which is in control. Earlier this month, IOC member Dick Pound admitted a decision to cancel could be made as late as May.

The situation remains fluid and talk of holding the Games elsewhere has been widely quashed. As Professor Victor Matheson, a sports economist who has written on the economics of the Olympics, told CNN Sport: ""Any world where Japan is too unsafe to hold the Olympics, London is also too unsafe to hold the Olympics.""

It is widely regarded that the options available are: to hope the outbreak eases and go ahead as planned, to hold the Games without spectators, to postpone or cancel completely.

The economic costs of Tokyo 2020

Canceling the Games would be unprecedented in peacetime.

The cost of hosting, organizers said in December, was some 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion) but, according to Reuters, that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat.

According to Reuters, Japan's Board of Audit put government spending on the Games between 2013 and 2018 at 1.06 trillion yen ($9.81billion). Sponsors, insurers and broadcasters have also committed billions to the Games.

Professor Matheson believes the truer sum is likely to be $25 billion, a vast majority of which has already been spent on large-scale infrastructure projects such as transportation networks, hotels and new venues.

""Whether the Games go on or not, most of this investment is a sunk cost at this point,"" Professor Matheson said.

""If you were to cancel the Olympics, you would be able to avoid some of the costs, such as billion dollars of security, if Tokyo's security costs were similar to London, but the biggest cost is all of the infrastructure and most of that spending has already taken place.""

A general view of the Olympic rings as they are illuminated for the first time to mark 6 months to go to the Olympic games at Odaiba Marine Park on January 24, 2020.

If the Tokyo 2020 was canceled, who'd be the losers?

Professor Matheson points to the IOC and the local organizing committee as being among the biggest losers in the event of cancellation, though both organizations will be insured.

""This isn't Delta Airlines, where we cancel a bunch of flights but once we solve the problem things are back to normal,"" he said, describing the Olympics as ""totally non-diversified.""

Another big loser would be Tokyo's hospitality industry.

""If we look at other host cities, the total number of international tourists was likely to increase by 100,000 visitors and those visitors were paying much higher room rental rates than the people they would have been replacing,"" said Matheson.

""That's potentially at least hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in lost revenue for the hospitality industry and that's probably not insurable.""

And then there are the sponsors, Matheson adds: ""If the Games don't go on at all, there are $3 billion worth of sponsorships that have been purchased and it's hard to know where that money goes if the Games don't all go on.

""That is a loss to someone, that's either a loss to broadcasters or it's a loss to the IOC, because they don't get the revenue from the contract, or it's a loss to an insurer.

""Somewhere along the line you have this valuable product that was going to produce all this TV entertainment and someone's going to lose that revenue somewhere.""

Japan's GDP, however, would not take a significant hit, said Matheson.

""In any scenario where the Olympic Games are canceled, the other costs associated with coronavirus are going to make the Olympic costs seem like a drop in the bucket.""

What is the least costly alternative for the IOC?

Postponing the Games by a few months has been mentioned as an option for the IOC should it be deemed unsafe for the Games to go ahead as scheduled.

But TV rights holders would be unhappy with having to schedule the Olympics during the NFL season in the US and the European soccer season.

After all, the Games are being held in August, despite the potential dangers the scorching weather could pose to athletes, because the wants of rights holders far outweighs that of the athletes.

If the show was unable to go on as planned, holding the Games this summer without spectators would be the least costly, according to Matheson.

Sponsors, athletes, and TV rightsholders would still have an Olympics, he said, with Japan's tourism sector being the biggest loser.

""You still need the athletes and production officials, which may still be too many people in one place during a severe outbreak. It would cost you all your tourism money and about a billion dollars in ticket revenue,"" said Matheson.

""But you still get to keep your $3-4 billion of TV rights. The athletes are still on the world stage and you get to keep the majority of your sponsorship money.

""It keeps a lot of your revenue intact and there's no scheduling issues. Postponing it by a year would be massively costly, this would be multibillions of dollars, but at least you would have all your revenue streams intact that year later.""

The National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (C-R).

What about the athletes?

Competing at the Olympics is the pinnacle for the majority of athletes taking part. Sacrifices have been made, lives put on hold, training sessions meticulously planned for a career-defining moment.

If the Games were to be canceled, so too would an athlete's shot at glory. Gone would be the opportunity to become an Olympic champion and the sponsorship opportunities that come with that. Then, there are the older athletes, those who have one final chance at greatness. There is an economic cost, and a human one too.

There are also the athletes who have yet to secure qualification. Athletes needing to improve their rankings may miss out completely because qualification events have been rescheduled. Baseball's final qualifying event, for example, has been moved from April to June.

Simone Biles is expected to be one of the star athletes at Tokyo 2020

Dave Hembrough, Sheffield Hallam University's lead for strength and conditioning, told CNN Sport said that while athletes were resilient the uncertainty would be disruptive, especially to those attempting to qualify and attending training camps.

""Those who are the best in the world will be so driven for the purpose of being the best, it won't disturb them much,"" he said.

""But if athletes don't qualify, they don't compete and it might lead to organizations not having the best athletes qualifying and, therefore, reducing the chance of winning medals.

""I'm involved with British weightlifting ... one of the things people are concerned with is the financial commitment of signing up for camps for competition, travel for hotels that are then going to be subsequently canceled. A lot of organizations cannot afford that.""

With a host of sporting events impacted by COVID-19's spread, F1 has remained resolute in its intention to start the 2020 season in Melbourne, despite having already postponed the Chinese GP.

""I am really very, very surprised that we're here,"" six-time world champion Hamilton told reporters.

""I think motorsport, I think it's great that we have races but for me, it's shocking that we're all sitting in this room. So many fans here already today and it seems like the rest of the world is reacting -- probably a little bit late.""

Hamilton also revealed he had been conscious to take preventive health measures as he traveled to Australia.

""Naturally being on a flight with god knows how many people and then stopping in an airport full of so many people, I didn't really think too hard on it,"" said the 35-year-old.

58,"['David Close', 'Amanda Jackson', 'Jason Hanna']",NBA suspends season after Jazz center Rudy Gobert tests positive for coronavirus,"(CNN) The NBA has suspended its season after a player preliminarily tested positive for coronavirus , stunning fans and players who heard the plan at stadiums Wednesday night, and adding to a list of daily events and activities altered by the virus' spread nationwide.

Utah Jazz all-star center Rudy Gobert tested positive, according to ESPN and other media outlets, shortly before his team's game Wednesday night against the host Oklahoma City Thunder.

The NBA postponed that game right before tip-off after it learned the diagnosis, surprising thousands of fans already in their seats at Chesapeake Energy Arena. Not long afterward, the league announced it would suspend the season ""until further notice"" after the night's slate of games around the country.

""The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,"" the NBA, which announced a Jazz player had tested positive but didn't identify him, said in a statement

The affected player was not in the arena, the league said. The player is in the care of health officials in Oklahoma City, according to the Jazz, which also did not name the player.

Four other NBA games were played Wednesday night -- but one other, a tilt between the New Orleans Pelicans and the Sacramento Kings in California, was called off because a referee assigned to work the game had previously worked a Jazz game, the NBA said.

The NBA's suspension is an outlier for professional sports in the United States, a country more used to seeing leagues stop or shrink seasons because of labor issues or, more rarely, war

The coronavirus pandemic has forced many US sports organizations to consider adjustments, including canceling events and holding games without fans. The National Hockey League said Wednesday night it is still evaluating the options and will have an update on Thursday.

""And then boom, a guy in a suit started a joint conversation with all the referees, then both head coaches -- next thing you knew the Jazz went into the locker room and then the Thunder,"" he said.

The public address announcer first told the crowd the game was delayed and awaiting league approval to go forward, offering no other details.

Eventually, the announcer told fans the game was called off, that they were safe, and to please leave the arena. Fans shouted in surprise.

Jazz's statement

In a statement, the Utah Jazz said a player on the team tested negative for influenza, strep throat and an upper respiratory infection Wednesday morning.

""The individual's symptoms diminished over the course of today, however, in a precautionary measure, and in consultation and cooperation with NBA medical staff and Oklahoma health officials, the decision was made to test for COVID-19,"" the team said.

""We wish this player a full and speedy recovery, and appreciate the work of health officials in Oklahoma to test a member of the Utah Jazz for COVID-19, as well as their prudent decision to test the entire team at this time,"" Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox said in a joint statement.

They added that they are working to identify people who have had close enough contact with the player as to have been potentially exposed.

""Was just on the phone with Rudy. He is doing good man. Lets not panick everyone. Love you all,"" Fournier tweeted

That close contact makes coronavirus a concern for the rest of the league, Detroit Pistons head coach Dwane Casey said following the announcement.

Casey and other figures in the league said the suspension was the right move until officials have a better grasp on the situation.

""We are not going to speculate on what we are going to do. We are going to regroup. We just heard about this five minutes ago. It's the utmost importance that our fans, our players, and our staff we feel safe and are safe,"" Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand said.

""But it was also incredibly terrifying ... The colors were magnificent, but they hid a dark secret. And I say it's a secret because people seem to be ignoring it.""

Pugh swam down a sub-glacial river underneath the Antarctic ice sheet in January, and in doing so experienced firsthand the level of melting that is taking place in East Antarctica.

Over the course of the 10-minute swim, he braved water temperatures of 0.1 degrees centigrade and air temperatures of minus 15.

The feat is part of a foolhardy initiative dubbed ""Speedo diplomacy,"" in which Pugh takes himself and his swimming trunks to the frontline line of climate change.

He has swum at the North Pole, Everest, and the Ross Sea, but the circumstances surrounding the most recent expedition in Antarctica proved unique.

""I could barely breathe, I was gasping for air,"" says Pugh, recalling the moment he first entered the water.

""The cold initially, it's burning all over my skin. My hands and my feet were in absolute agony. My body is saying get out, get out, get out. My mind is saying focus, focus, focus.

""It's not about bravado, it's about sending the right message. I don't think swimming in a wetsuit or a drysuit sends the right message.""

When Pugh reached the end of his swim, he was hauled out of the water by Russian ice hockey great and close friend Slava Fetisov.

""His skin felt so fragile, like (it could have) broken up into little pieces in a second,"" Fetisov, an Olympic gold medalist in 1984 and 1988, tells CNN Sport.

""I've never seen a man be cold like that ... But in his eyes there was so much life and so much hope.""

Pugh is helped out of the water by close friend and ice hockey great Slava Fetisov.

The temperature of the water was just one hurdle Pugh had to overcome.

He was forced to take slow, deliberate strokes as the tunnel he was swimming down started to narrow. Huge stalactites hung from the tunnel roof; knocking one could have been catastrophic.

Then there was the threat of falling ice and of being sucked down a moulin -- a giant sinkhole in the ice sheet that plummets hundreds of meters to the bedrock.

It became so dark at one point on his swim that Pugh was forced to remove his goggles and swim careful breaststroke to find his way.

""I had to be 100% focused,"" he says.

""I focused on every single stroke, trying to make it as powerful and as forward-moving as possible. It's important when you're swimming in those environments to be psyched up, but not psyched out.""

Pugh examines a glacial tunnel where stalactites hang from the roof.

The aim of the expedition was to convince policy makers to introduce a marine protected area in East Antarctica.

Similar to national parks, these protect certain parts of the world from extractive and destructive activities -- in the case of Antarctica, industrial overfishing -- and make them more resilient to climate change.

Having already negotiated a marine protection area in the Ross Sea in 2016, this year Pugh hopes to agree to three more, one in East Antarctica, one in the Weddell Sea and one on the Antarctic Peninsula.

Collectively, this would cover four million square kilometers -- roughly double the size of Western Europe, according to Pugh -- with China and Russia still needed to agree to the proposal.

Upon returning from Antarctica, Pugh traveled to the Kremlin to meet with Vladimir Putin's team, where he says he had ""very warm and constructive discussions."" He hopes to travel to Beijing later this year.

Pugh (right) met with President Putin's team alongside Fetisov (second right) earlier this year.

""It all just reaffirms my view that we now need to join the dots,"" says Pugh.

""Because I've seen the Arctic sea ice melt, we've all seen these horrific fires in California and in Australia , and I've seen glaciers retreat all over the world -- in the Himalayas, in the Arctic and in the Antarctic.

""But now to see an enormous ice sheet and just to see so much water flowing off an enormous ice sheet. It is very, very, very concerning.""

Pugh has witnessed accelerated melting of ice in Antarctica.

Earlier this year, scientists at the University of Durham revealed that there were 65,000 supraglacial lakes -- that is, lakes on top of a glacier -- in East Antarctica.

In November, world leaders will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26 , the main United Nations climate change negotiations for the year.

""We need world leaders now to step up, to be courageous, or to step aside,"" says Pugh.

""They need to come prepared, they must come with ambition, they must come with focus, they must come with concrete measures which can turn this crisis around ... Time has now run out.""

Fetisov, who supported Pugh throughout the Antarctica expedition, introduced the Briton to the Russian ministers needed to sign the Ross Sea agreement in 2016.

Fetisov (left) and Pugh speak in Moscow following their Antarctica expedition.

The pair are long-time friends, bound by the shared belief that, in Fetisov's words, we are ""a step away from a huge ecological catastrophe.""

It's what has motivated the former ice hockey star, who won his seven world championship and two Olympic titles in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, to raise awareness of the climate crisis. In 2018, he was appointed UN Environment Patron for Polar Regions.

""I played defense all my life and I feel it,"" says Fetisov. ""It's time to defend.

""I can't look in the eyes of children and young people and say no, it's probably not going to happen -- it is going to happen.""

His latest project, ""The Last Game,"" involves traveling the world -- they've been to Israel, the UAE, Finland, Singapore, Moscow and New York -- to raise awareness of climate change.

The next stop, weather permitting, is to take the initiative to the North Pole.

Fetisov, a fearsome defenseman in his playing days, believes sport can be a powerful player when it comes to the environment.

""Athletes are the most popular people on the planet,"" he says.

""They can gain trust from citizens because they work hard, they know about results and know how to get everybody in a team on the same page.

""Every day around the world we've got big sport competitions. We can use sport more and more to promote ecological problems, that's my belief.""

Fetisov participates in a ""Last Game"" event in New York.

Growing up in Moscow, Fetisov used to skate outside from October until April. By February this year, he says, there was no snow on the ground in the Russian capital.

You don't always need to swim in freezing Antarctic waters to witness the impact of climate change, but Pugh and Fetisov hope the ripples of their latest expedition will be felt around the world.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/ZVyK7XFyP1g/index.html,CNN,Sports,True
62,"['Ben Church', 'Cnn Video Produced Noura Abou Zeinab']",The 'Queen' of Cheer reveals how Netflix mega-hit changed her life,"(CNN) Inspirational, but tough as nails, Monica Aldama is a coach you don't want to mess about with or disappoint.

Aldama is very much the star of Netflix's latest mega-hit Cheer -- the six-part series which reveals the world of cheerleading at its mesmerizing, bone-crunching and jaw-dropping best.

Mapping the season of Navarro College's dominant cheer squad, the viral sensation has changed the way thousands of people view the sport.

Dedication, sacrifice and hours of practice are laid bare as young athletes from across the US find sanctuary in the most unlikely of places.

""I'm very competitive and I want to be successful but I also want to be that person that leads by example. I really set a high standard for myself,"" Aldama, who has become known as the ""Queen of Cheer,"" told CNN Sport.

""If I expect something from my kids, I should expect it from myself too. I shouldn't even have to say anything but my actions will lead the kids and they'll do the things I'm doing.""

Cheer coach Monica Aldama spoke to CNN Sport about life after the Netflix show.

Ellen and Oprah

Aldama had already established herself as one of the best cheer coaches in the sport, but not even she could have prepared herself for what happened next.

Appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Oprah's live tour catapulted the entire team to stardom and shone a bright light on Aldama's unrivaled success and methods.

Her glittering career has included 14 National Championships as a coach and her style has been compared to some of sports' most revered leaders.

""It's very strange, because I've had so many people view me in different ways after watching this show,"" Aldama said. ""Some people love me, some people don't.

""I know where my heart is and I know what happened the other four months that were not in those six hours. I would not change anything.""

The kids Aldama continually refers to throughout the show are the young adults who manage to secure a place on her acclaimed team.

It's an elite squad made up of students from a variety of backgrounds from all over the US, uniting together in a remote corner of Texas as they are rigorously drilled to compete at the very top of their game.

For many of the teenagers, a place in Aldama's team is a ticket out of trouble and a chance to make a better life for themselves.

The series, directed by Greg Whiteley, highlights the often harrowing back stories of some of the cheerleaders and Aldama is acutely aware that her role stretches way beyond coaching complex acrobatic moves.

She is as much a mother figure to her students as she is a coach, soaking up their anxieties and pushing them to succeed in both their personal and professional lives.

The docuseries follows the Navarro College cheer team in their pursuit of success.

Aldama helps create mind-blowing routines.

'I don't have to prove myself'

One of the young people to flourish under Aldama's wing is Morgan Simianer

The talented gymnast has become one of the breakout stars from the show, with her complicated history providing the series with one of its most emotional moments.

We learn how Simianer was forced to raise herself in a trailer after her biological parents abandoned her at an early age, but how that turbulent childhood gave her an unwavering drive to succeed.

It's an attitude that comes across crystal clear in a series where her loyalty to Aldama, who seems to provide a pillar of stability in Simianer's life, is resolute.

""I've really tried to work over the years on being better at that and just learning what I could do to fill those roles for those kids,"" added Aldama as she reflected on the complexity of coaching the team.

""I think that's really why I'm still here, it's not cheerleading. I've won plenty of titles, I don't have to prove myself there. It's the relationship with the kids and the feeling of watching them succeed.

""I feel like it's God's purpose for me and that's why I haven't left the job yet.""

Make no mistake, as much as Navarro College is a sanctuary for many, corners are never cut in the constant search for success.

Aldama demands nothing but 100% dedication to the cause with eyes firmly set on the annual National Championship in Daytona, scene of the thrilling finale to the series.

Her mantra is to ""keep going until you get it right, and then you keep going until you can't get it wrong,"" though that level of expectation pushes her charges to the very edge of their physical and emotional capabilities.

Morgan Simianer is one of the young cheerleaders who features in the show.

Injury heavy

Aldama's trademark moves -- breathtaking somersaults, tumbles, and stunning pyramids -- combine to deliver an explosive two minutes and 15 seconds routine which can occasionally go wrong.

""They showed every time we fell but they didn't show the one thousand times that we did it right or the progressions that we did to build up to the harder skills,"" said Aldama when asked whether the series gave an accurate depiction of the program she runs.

""We definitely are very safe, but it is cheerleading. It's a risky sport that we're doing but we do take precautions and I think that it was just a little heavy on the injuries.""

What's not in doubt is that the special culture forged at the college seems to encourage its stars to push through blood, sweat, and tears for the sake of the team ethic.

Notably former squad members return to help mentor the latest crop, a feature of the program that Monica takes immense pride in.

However, her coaching style is not just with competition in mind. Preparing these young adults for life in the real world is equally important to her.

""Self-accountability is just such a big thing for me, because so many people in this day and age, want to shift the blame to others and just not take responsibility for their own actions,"" Aldama said.

""If you've made a commitment to be somewhere, then you should show up. If it's class, then you should show up. If it's practice, you should show up. If it's a job, you should show up.""

Aldama said the training is very safe despite the show focusing on injuries.

True athletes

As well as enhancing the Navarro College cheer team's reputation, Aldama hopes the hit show can also help the sport establish itself in the mainstream.

So often viewed through the lens of tired stereotypes, the show has given the sport a platform to show just how athletic it can be when done properly.

""These kids are honestly some of the toughest kids I know. The work ethic that these kids have is top notch, they will come in and work, work, work. Work through the pain,"" Aldama added.

""The commitment is unreal. I just didn't feel like people who aren't a part of this world really knew that these kids are that athletic and that they have that grit and that determination.

""I was hoping that the world would see them as the true athletes that they are.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/WRJHX_wI8qU/index.html,CNN,Sports,True

68,['Matias Grez'],Atletico Madrid stuns Liverpool at Anfield to dump holder out of the Champions League,"(CNN) Atletico Madrid stunned Liverpool with three goals in extra time to knock the holders out of the Champions League.

With the tie level at the end of the 90 minutes thanks to Georginio Wijnaldum's header, Roberto Firmino looked to have scored the tie-winning goal just four minutes into extra time.

But two goals from substitute Marcos Llorente in the space of eight minutes, the first courtesy of a howler from stand-in keeper Adrian, drew the sides level on the night and gave Atletico the lead on aggregate.

Anfield was stunned into total silence as coach Jurgen Klopp looked bemused on the touchline, arms held out disbelievingly.

Alvaro Morata scored the third in the final few seconds to secure a memorable 4-2 aggregate win for Atletico.

This stadium had been the site of one of the greatest ever Champions League comebacks last season, as Liverpool overturned a 3-0 first-leg deficit against Barcelona to reach the final.

Tonight, it's the site of one of Liverpool's most painful European defeats.

Atletico Madrid celebrate Marcos Llorente's second goal.

Pantomime villain

There would have been more than a few hearts in mouths inside the opening 20 seconds at Anfield, as Joao Felix's slick turn and pass set Diego Costa through on goal.

The Spanish striker, a familiar foe for Liverpool from his time at Chelsea, could only skew his shot into the side netting but it was an early reminder for Liverpool of the quality that Atletico Madrid possesses going forward.

Costa was soon slipping into his preferred role of pantomime villain, petulantly throwing the ball away as Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian attempted to take a quick free-kick.

It was a tactic Atletico had been expected to employ in an attempt to frustrate both the Liverpool fans and players into submission and reduce the game to a scrappy affair.

They succeeded in doing exactly that but Liverpool was giving as good as it was getting, ferociously snapping into tackles with

From the outset, Anfield wasn't quite at its famous levels of noise -- perhaps the torrential rain had dampened the atmosphere somewhat -- but Wijnaldum's stinging strike, palmed away brilliantly by Jan Oblak, was enough to spark the crowd into life.

Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates his opening goal.

As had been expected, Liverpool dominated possession inside the opening 30 minutes but, Wijnaldum's effort aside, hadn't troubled Atletico's back line.

Diego Simeone's side is widely considered the best defensive unit in European football and as Liverpool's attacks were repelled again and again, it sometimes felt as though it was crossing balls into a brick wall.

But Liverpool's pressure eventually started to tell and a few of those bricks started coming loose; Wijnaldum once again tested Oblak before he eventually found a way through.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found the Dutchman totally unmarked in the middle of the penalty area and he directed his header down into the wet turf and into the top corner.

Wijnaldum is making a habit of scoring big goals for Liverpool in the Champions League; last season, he scored a brace to haul Liverpool level in that famous semifinal comeback win against Barcelona.

Anfield roared into life and Atletico's players spent the remaining two minutes of the first half desperately waiting for the half-time whistle to blow.

Backs to the wall

Those 15 minutes respite changed very little and Atleti's players were back out in the second half and immediately had their backs to the wall.

Again they had Oblak to thank for keeping them level in the tie, as the Slovenian stopper did brilliantly to save efforts from Oxlande-Chamberlain and Roberto Firmino.

But midway through the second half, Liverpool was given a sharp warning of how quickly this tie could change.

Felix, Atletico's $142 million star signing, managed to wriggle free on the edge of the area and his deflected effort brought an awkward save out of Adrian.

Liverpool's stand-in keeper should have dealt with the effort comfortably but presented Angel Correa with an opportunity from his weak parry, though he did eventually manage to smother the ball.

With little more than 20 minutes remaining, the whole of Anfield thought Liverpool had found the tie-winning goal.

Marcos Llorente celebrates his second goal in extra time.

After ricocheting around in the box, the ball found its way to Andy Robertson at the far post but Kieran Trippier did brilliantly to get a slight touch on the header and deflect it onto the crossbar.

In the dying seconds, totally against the run of play, Atleti thought it had found the winner.

Renan Lodi's free-kick into the box was met by Saul Niguez's thumping header into the top corner. The 3,000 Atletico fans behind that goal went wild, as did the entire Atleti bench, but their celebrations were cut short by the linesman's flag for an obvious offside.

30 minutes of madness

Extra time started at a blistering pace and Firmino, with his first Anfield goal all season, looked to have secured passage through to the quarterfinals, reacting fastest after his header had hit the post to stab the rebound home.

But then it was the turn of Adrian to take center stage, the player called upon the least throughout the 90 minutes and as much of a spectator as the 60,000 fans inside Anfield.

The Spaniard's scuffed clearance gifted the ball to substitute Llorente, who did brilliantly to bend the ball into the vacant far corner of the goal.

Then, just like that, it was two.

Some lazy defending from both Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk gifted Llorente with space on the edge of the area and he curled another unerring strike into the bottom corner.

Anfield was silent, save for the small pocket of delirious Atletico fans at the opposite end of the stadium.

With seconds remaining, Alvaro Morata popped up to score Atelti's third and emphatically seal passage through to the quarterfinals.

70,['Matias Grez'],"Historic women's deal 'reward for all the hard work we've been putting in for years,' says Spain star","(CNN) The Spanish league that Marta Corredera made her debut in more than a decade ago is almost unrecognizable to the one she plays in today.

In the 12 years since she first appeared for Espanyol, attendances have increased, a television deal has been agreed and a major title sponsor has been signed.

However, last month saw the biggest and most important change of them all as the female players in Spain's top division secured an historic league-wide agreement that will guarantee every footballer an annual salary.

The minimum full-time player wage agreed for a 40-hour week is €16,000 ($18,000) and for a part-time 30-hour week is €12,000 ($13,600), with both including maternity leave, injury pay and paid holiday.

""It's the reward for all the hard work we've been putting in for years,"" Corredera, who now plays for Levante, tells CNN.

""In the end, not only as female footballers but any female workers we have the rights to have laws and rules that shelter us and protect us -- until now we were totally unprotected.

Marta Corredera playing for Spain's history making team at the 2019 Women's World Cup.

""In any situation of unemployment, injury, including maternity, Spanish female footballers didn't have that law that protected them. Now with this new agreement we've taken a step forward in that regard, that players feel secure and, above all, valued for what they are doing as their job.""

The association of clubs (ACFF) and several players' unions had been locked in negotiations over the league's collective bargaining agreement for almost 18 months, until an agreement was finally reached at the end of February.

Much of the delay was down to the ACFF refusing to meet the wage demands for part-time players, which it proposed should have been €8,000 ($9,000) instead of the €12,000 ($13,600) that was eventually agreed on.

The stall in negotiations forced the players to take drastic action.

In November, the footballers boycotted all eight first division matches during one gameweek, after 189 representatives from the league's 16 clubs voted 93% in favor of taking strike action.

""We all know well that when the population mobilizes is when people realize that things need to change,"" Corredera says. ""We had been asking for this agreement for some time, for them to confirm it and come to an agreement.

JUST WATCHED Real Madrid's Kosovare Asllani on the women's game Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Real Madrid's Kosovare Asllani on the women's game 02:02

""I think clubs as well as the association didn't think that the players would come together and strike. We showed that strength of everyone together and being united was what helped open people's eyes and show that we were serious, that really wanted this agreement and would do everything we possibly could to achieve it.""

The strike convinced the clubs to reopen negotiations as they successfully sought funding from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) -- which pays clubs €350,000 ($397,000) per season -- and through a television rights deal to meet the players' demands.

Closing the gap

For Corredera, the new deal caps off a startling rise for Spanish women's football, both domestically and internationally.

The versatile winger left Spain in 2015 to play for Arsenal in the Women's Super League and won both the FA Cup and WSL Cup during her time in England.

France's top tier is widely considered the best in Europe, though arguably the talent is far more concentrated at the top of the division compared to larger spread in England's WSL.

Lyon has dominated the Champions League in recent seasons, winning the last four editions, while French clubs have made up five of the last eight finalists.

However, Spain had its breakthrough year in the competition last season as Barcelona became the first Spanish club in Champions League history to reach either the semifinals or the final.

Barcelona became the first Spanish team to reach either the semifinal or final or the Champions League.

Though Barcelona eventually lost 4-1 to Lyon, Correrdera believes it's evidence that the gap is closing between Spain and its rival European leagues; indeed, the country is guaranteed another semifinalist with Barca and Atletico Madrid facing off in this season's quarterfinals.

""It's completely different now than it was before,"" she says of the league's quality. ""Above all, the level of the players, the level of the matches have increased a lot.

""The matches are a lot more difficult to win because the level of the players has grown. This is down to the fact they are training a lot better, there are trainers, fitness coaches that are more prepared, that understand and work with the female body because we are different (to men).

""Thanks to the clubs, the federation, our whole environment, we're improving. Television is supporting us a lot more and people see us more in their homes, people go to games more. We're more visible and started to have more significance in society.

""We all know that those leagues have been working for many years on a good trajectory and that gives them an advantage over us, but I think we're getting closer to those countries and leagues because here in Spain we're working really well.

""That's cut the distance, we need to carry on like this and the generations that are coming up are also making their mark and I think that will help us achieve success in the present or near future.""

Corredera has lofty ambitions this season both at club and international level.

Her Levante side, which she says has the perfect blend of youth and experience, sits in third place in the league -- just five points behind Atletico Madrid in second -- and is dreaming of qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2009.

Marta Corredera goes past the USWNT's Megan Rapinoe during the She Believes Cup clash.

Corredera was part of the Spain squad at last summer's Women's World Cup that made history with the country's first ever appearance in the knockout stages.

The national team has since gone from strength to strength and earned an invitation to this year's She Believes Cup, the annual four-team tournament held in the United States.

The match was due to be played Wednesday, but the league said that the postponement was a ""precautionary measure"" after Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis tested positive for the virus.

It said the risk of them developing the virus was ""extremely low"" but that individuals who met Marinakis were self-isolating at home for 14 days in line with government guidance. The 14-day period ends on Friday.

72,['Matias Grez'],Thrilling RB Leipzig runs riot to dump Jose Mourinho and Tottenham out of the Champions League,"(CNN) Outplayed, outgunned and outcoached, Jose Mourinho was powerless to stop his Totttenham side suffering a Champions League exit at the hands of RB Leipzig.

Mourinho lamented his injury crisis after the first leg , describing the defeat as going into ""a gunfight without bullets.""

On Tuesday, Mourinho didn't even have the luxury of turning up to the second leg with an empty gun.

Leipzig was again totally dominant for 90 minutes, only this time it took advantage with two early goals to seal a 3-0 win courtesy of captain Marcel Sabitzer's brace and Emil Forsberg late strike.

With just two draws and four defeats from his last six matches, Mourinho is currently suffering the longest winless streak of his 935-match managerial career and is without a win in the Champions League knockout stages for six years.

""I was very positive yesterday and that's the way I have to be all the time, if I'm not positive it's better not to come to the game,"" a philosophical Mourinho told BT Sport after the match. ""Yes I'm positive, I motivate the players and yes we all believed but we know that in this moment (with injuries) it's all very difficult.

Jose Mourinho was powerless to prevent his Tottenham side crashing out of Europe.

""They are a very, very strong side ... and after our first couple of mistakes they score and the game of course is very, very difficult. They deserved to go through, they were the best team. If I can be critical, I keep it for us. Sometimes difficult moments are moments that can prepare the future in a better way.

""Of course there is nobody to blame when it looks like we have a traumatic injury and every traumatic injury ends with months and months (out). It's very hard and the players they gave everything. People can say 'excuses' but I'm pretty sure it's bad for anyone and I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation.""

Tottenham was lucky to come away from that first leg just one goal behind after RB Leipzig dominated for the vast majority of the match.

Aside from a late flurry of attacks in the closing stages, Spurs spent most of the game on the back foot -- but the opening 10 minutes of the second leg very much reflected the closing 10 minutes of the first.

Mourinho appeared to set out his side in far more attacking fashion; the forward trio of Erik Lamelo, Dele Alli and Lucas Moura were snapping at the heels of Leipzig's defenders and looked lively every time they streamed forward.

However, Julian Nagelsmann's Leipzig is a sight to behold when attacking at full tilt, and in the blink of an eye had turned defense into attack to double its advantage on aggregate.

On a trademark blistering counterattack, Leipzig's first of the match, star striker Timo Werner reacted quickest to his blocked shot and laid the loose ball off to Sabitzer on the edge of the area.

The captain hit a low first time shot that Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris got a hand to but couldn't keep out.

Marcel Sabitzer celebrates after scoring his opening goal.

And if there were question marks over Lloris failed attempt at a save for the first goal, alarm bells were ringing for the second.

It was Sabitzer again with the goal, turning Angelino's cross in at the near post with his head. Lloris was once again well positioned and got a strong hand to the ball, but once again failed to prevent the goal.

Deja vu?

Given the Spurs now needed three away goals to progress to the next round, it would seem remiss to not talk about last season's comeback from the same position against Ajax in the semifinals.

On that famous night in Amsterdam, Tottenham did indeed find the three second-half goals it needed to progress to the final, though any lingering hopes of deja vu in Leipzig were quickly dispelled in the second half.

The host was utterly dominant, sucking the life out of what were now weary Tottenham legs and tired heads.

Leipzig did eventually put the Spurs out of its misery with just three minutes remaining, as Forsberg reacted first to a loose ball and poked home with his first touch since coming on as a substitute just seconds earlier.

For a club playing in the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in its history, Leipzig already looks well and truly at home.

Seven goals, no fans

In the night's other match, Valencia and Atalanta shared seven goals between them -- and 12 overall on aggregate -- but sadly there were no fans to witness it.

Last week, it was announced that the match would be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak, as Spain's health ministry said it wanted to avoid ""large gatherings of fans.""

Valencia and Atalanta played their match in front of empty stands.

Leading 4-1 from the first leg, Atalanta -- appearing in the Champions League for the first time in its history -- scored an early opening goal through Josip Ilicic's penalty to end the game as a contest, but it certainly didn't end it as a spectacle.

When Kevin Gameiro equalized on the night for the host, there was an audible roar from the Valencia fans that were gathered outside the stadium to watch the match.

In fairness to the stadium announcer, he lacked no enthusiasm when announcing Gameiro as the goalscorer over the speaker system.

Another five goals were scored, including a hat-trick for Ilicic, as Atalanta ran out 4-3 winner on the night and 8-4 on aggregate.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_football/~3/caMEBTiVUZg/index.html,CNN,Sports,True

Juve's 2-0 win over Inter Milan was one of the biggest matches in Serie A this season and a potentially defining result in the race for the Scudetto, but nobody was at the Allianz Stadium in Turin to witness it.

Italy is the European country hardest hit by the novel coronavirus and is still struggling to get the outbreak under control; there are now more than 7,300 cases in the country and 366 deaths.

Authorities took extraordinary measures this weekend by locking down much of the north of the country in an attempt to stop the virus spreading, restricting travel for more than 15 million people.

Inter Milan and Juventus players compete in an empty stadium due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

While the large-scale quarantine only affects the north, other restrictions have been placed on the rest of the country -- schools, university classes, theaters and cinemas, bars, nightclubs and sports events have all been suspended.

Yet that film is only one example of a recurring theme in movies associated with such an outbreak, a longtime staple of science fiction that has always been informed by science fact.

Adapted from a comic book, the movie casts the heavily muscled star as a zombie killing machine, in what amounts to a superhero origin story with more twists than expected, but ultimately a simple-minded excuse for lots and lots of action.

Diesel plays Ray Garrison, a soldier introduced on a perilous mission before getting kidnapped and killed -- and that's all before the opening titles.

Ray's resurrection comes courtesy of RST corporation, just your average shadowy research facility that turns wounded warriors into super-soldiers with Robocop-like enhancements.

Ray, however, is its masterpiece, with the company having borrowed bodies from the military before perfecting nanotechnology that not only brought him back but turns him into a a near-unstoppable force, capable of almost instantly regenerating when damaged. Think Wolverine, minus the claws.

He's described as a multi-billion-dollar prototype (take that, ""Six Million Dollar Man""), under the stewardship of tech visionary Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce, kind of slumming it).

86,['Review Brian Lowry'],Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much in 'Big Time Adolescence',"(CNN) Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much as a performer playing a 20-something slacker in ""Big Time Adolescence,"" a Hulu-bound movie that's most surprising for what it isn't. Somewhat ironically, the main flaw with this earnest film built around a directionless character is its lack of a clear objective.

Buying into the premise requires a bit of leeway to get started: During high school, Davidson's Zeke dated the older sister of Mo (Griffin Gluck), and remained his pal after they broke up. Now Mo's a 16-year-old high school student -- with all the attendant insecurities -- and Zeke, at 23, mostly enjoys getting high and playing video games.

That the two remain near-inseparable seems odd to, well, pretty much everyone, perhaps especially Mo's dad (Jon Cryer). Yet the family tolerates the situation, which will gradually have pretty significant consequences (foreshadowed in a pre-credit sequence) as Mo's budding adolescence runs into Zeke's Peter Pan-like case of arrested development.

For Davidson, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star whose off-screen life is generally more interesting than his on-screen contributions, Zeke certainly offers an easy transition to movies, though the central focus is actually Gluck, whose struggles with all the usual teen troubles are complicated by Zeke's been-there advice and generally bad influence.

Mo insists Zeke is ""a nice guy once you get to know him,"" but his cavalier attitude -- toward everything from his retail job to relationships -- doesn't always make him the most sterling counselor. That includes his suggestion that Mo become the source of booze and pot for a circle of ""friends"" that not surprisingly mushrooms after learning that he can supply them.

Hanks is there working on an as-yet-untitled Elvis Presley movie for Warner Bros. He is playing the singer's manager Colonel Tom Parker. Baz Luhrmann is directing.

A spokesperson for Warner Bros. told CNN the project was in pre-production at the time of Hanks and his wife's diagnosis.

""We have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for COVID-19 (coronavirus),"" Warner Bros. said in a statement provided to CNN. ""We are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual. The health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world.""

""The individual who tested positive for COVID-19 is currently receiving treatment,"" the statement said.

Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company.

According to her web site, Wilson had scheduled concert dates in Sydney and South Brisbane. She has been touring in support of her new album ""Halfway to Home.""

The Sydney Opera House where Wilson performed said on Thursday that disinfecting efforts are underway there and health officials are tracking down concertgoers who attended the performance given by Wilson last Saturday.

A Sydney Opera House spokesperson told CNN that ""the Opera House is in touch with NSW Health and Queensland Health and will be acting on their advice.""

The spokesperson added that ""This includes getting in touch with anyone, including patrons and staff, who may have been in contact with the couple while at the Opera House.""

What happened

According to Hanks, he and his wife were alerted to something being wrong after they ""felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches.""

""Rita had some chills that came and went,"" he wrote on his Instagram post. ""Slight fevers too.""

The couple were tested for the coronavirus, he wrote, and found to be positive.

How it happened

Neither Hanks nor Wilson have said how they may have contracted the virus.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, they are two of seven new cases that were reported in Queensland on Thursday.

An official with Queensland Health, the Australian government department which is overseeing efforts to control the outbreak of the disease in that area, did not name the couple but said all of the new cases ""contracted the illness outside Australia and traveled to Queensland with the virus,"" the publication reported.

Their ages

Both Hanks and Wilson are 63 years old, which puts them in the category of ""older adults"" who, according to experts, are the most susceptible to becoming seriously ill from the virus.

How they are doing

Chet Hanks posted a video on Instagram, saying he had just talked with them and ""They both are fine.""

""They're not even that sick. They're not worried about it,"" the younger Hanks said. ""They're not trippin' but they're going through the necessary health precautions obviously.""

Colin Hanks tweeted his gratitude for the support his family has received.

""My parents are receiving excellent care in Australia and doing well (and in good spirits) given the circumstances,"" he wrote. ""Despite the fact I'm in LA and haven't seen them in over three weeks, we have been in constant contact and am confident that they will make a full recovery.""

What's next

According to Hanks, he and his wife are taking it one day at a time.

""The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?""

94,['Marianne Garvey'],Kate Beckinsale posts powerful response to Harvey Weinstein's prison sentence,"(CNN) Kate Beckinsale posted a powerful response to Harvey Weinstein's 23-year prison sentence, calling it a ""huge relief.""

Beckinsale shared her own allegations of harassment by Weinstein in 2017. In an Instagram post Wednesday, she recalled the premiere of her Weinstein-produced film ""Serendipity"" in 2001, when the mood following 9/11 was somber.

""These photos were taken at the premiere of Serendipity on October 5, 2001. We all refused to go because holding a premiere mere weeks after 9/11 with the city still smoking felt like the most insensitive, tone deaf, disrespectful idea possible. But Harvey insisted. We flew into New York and somehow got through it,"" Beckinsale explained.

Weinstein verbally abused, Becksinsale said, for wearing a pantsuit to the premiere.

""The next morning Harvey called me and asked if I would like to bring my less than two year old daughter to his house for a playdate with his similar aged daughter I said ok. I turned up and he immediately called for his nanny to take the babies to another room to play,"" Beckinsale wrote. ""I went to go with them and he said 'No, you wait here.'""

96,['Karla Cripps'],New 'Jungle Bubbles' invite travelers to sleep next to elephants in Thailand's Golden Triangle,"Chiang Rai, Thailand (CNN) — Elephants don't sleep much. They eat loudly. They pass gas loudly, too.

The two transparent domes sit next to a large enclosure inhabited by three rescued elephants, which are cared for by the resort's Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation

Related content 20 stunning new Asia Pacific luxury hotels to check into in 2020

Guests can sit back and watch as these female elephants play with the strategically placed ""toys"" that hang from large trees, their powerful trunks occasionally ripping off huge chunks of bark and branches, sending loud cracks through the evening air.

But really, they mainly just want to eat.

Thankfully, a hefty supply of sugar cane is placed within eyesight of the bubbles, meaning the elephants are almost always just a few steps away.

Once-in-a-lifetime experience

l e v a r t

The bubbles are booked as an ""experience"" in addition to your reserved resort room, for 17,700 baht (US$563) per night per couple. This means you can just pack an overnight bag and leave the rest of your belongings in your suite.

Guests are picked up from the lobby just before sunset, then driven down a dirt road in an open-air jeep before taking a short walk through the resort's rice paddy to get to the bubbles.

Shortly after arrival, staff deliver an evening picnic basket, filled with pre-selected sandwiches and other cold dishes, allowing you to eat alongside the animals. There's a strict ""no hands"" policy when it comes to the elephants though -- bubble guests are not allowed to touch or feed them.

So how comfortable are the bubbles?

Each air-conditioned, pressurized 22-square-meter space is a mini slice of luxury, furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. There's a small washroom with a toilet and shower, along with a couple of chairs and a small table near the bed. No TVs here -- the elephants are the star of this show.

Sensitive sleepers will find It particularly surreal. As night passed during a recent visit, the moon made its way over the bubble, offering various levels of illumination. (Eye masks are provided as it can be surprisingly bright.)

Given these ladies don't nod off much -- elephants in captivity sleep only 4-6 hours a day -- you'll hear all sorts of delightful sounds throughout the night and might find yourself crawling out of bed for a late-night peek.

The bed features wrap-around curtains, offering privacy for those who worry they won't wake up before the caretakers arrive with the elephants' breakfast.

Trial and error

The idea for the ""Jungle Bubbles"" came from General Manager Gaudéric Harang, who has been with the resort for about a year and a half. He says they were born of a desire to push the boundaries and offer a unique guest experience in line with modern luxury expectations.

In addition to safety concerns -- ""making sure our bubbles would be elephant proof"" -- he says they had to meet very high standards.

""As a top notch resort, we had to ensure the experience would be very luxurious and to the level of what is expected by our guests,"" he explains.

Once the bubbles were set up, Harang was the first to trial them.

""Being in the north of Thailand, we are lucky to have a climate that's more varied than in the rest of the country,"" he says. ""Though short, we go through a winter season that is very cold. When the bubbles were finally ready [in December] it was 6 degrees Celsius in the morning and...well I froze!

""There was no heater. Also, being located in the jungle there is a lot of humidity so the bubbles were very wet at night due to all the condensation. So, I woke up at 3 a.m., soaked and cold.""

As a result, the bubbles are now equipped with an air conditioner, space heater and dehumidifier to ensure a comfortable climate for all seasons.

""When I finally saw the bubbles in place I was so happy it all worked out, but I think I was only really impressed when I slept in it the second time [after the climate issues were sorted],"" he recalls, telling CNN Travel it was truly a ""wow"" moment.

""When you finally live it, you see it's really a fantastic experience. We couldn't have planned it better.""

The right elephants for the job

Picking the right elephants for the Jungle Bubbles experience was another logistical issue that needed to be sorted, says John Roberts, Anantara's Director of Elephants.

Besides size considerations -- how many elephants could comfortably live on the available plot of land? -- they also had to decide which of the camp's elephants would enjoy being together in the enclosure. Turns out, even elephants can get into tiffs with their friends -- just like humans but with an additional 3.5 tonnes of weight to throw around.

The three elephants in the Jungle Bubbles enclosure all arrived at the resort between 2006-2010, so Roberts and his team already had ample time to get familiar with their temperaments.

""We watched them for a long time,"" says Roberts. ""We know that they like being together -- actually [two of them] are pretty much inseparable at this stage and if you try and separate them they get pretty stressed.""

Offering a better life to captive elephants

The resort, located in Chiang Saen, overlooks Myanmar and Laos. Etienne de Villiers

Anantara's nonprofit Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation (GTAEF), founded in 2006 and overseen by Roberts, cares for about two dozen elephants.

Most of the animals have led hard lives -- some spent their days walking the streets of Bangkok with their owners, making money begging from tourists. Others came from tourist trekking camps.

The way the program works is the foundation invites mahouts (elephant trainers/owners) and their families to move to Chiang Rai with their elephants and live in the foundation's camp.

The foundation offers them a wage, which includes the cost of care for their elephants. This amounts to about $18,000 per elephant per year.

Roberts acknowledges that in a perfect world all elephants would be roaming free in the wild but the situation is incredibly complex.

""Unfortunately, you can't release elephants in Thailand,"" he says, rattling off a long list of complications including fears of disease transmission, potential conflict in a fragile wild herd and an inability for domesticated elephants to fend for themselves given they've spent most if not all of their lives in captivity. And then there are Thailand's laws, which would also need to be changed.

Thailand's domesticated elephants are all registered under the Draft Animals Act, so ""if you put a captive elephant in a national park you're officially illegally grazing your livestock and that's the law as it is,"" says Roberts.

As an alternative, the GTAEF aims to improve the welfare of captive elephants through various programs not just at its resort but throughout the region -- including mahout training -- while also taking part in conservation and wild elephant programs.

At the resort's elephant camp, this means figuring out the elephants' personalities though science and observation and matching them with activities that suit them -- an essential part of their well-being. For instance, elephants that are comfortable around strangers take part in the peaceful ""Walking with Giants"" experience.

""In the wild their entire lives are based around walking long distances and finding food,"" says Roberts. ""They have big brains, you have to keep them stimulated doing different things. You could just put them out there in a field, but they'll stand in one spot all day.""

97,['Tamara Hardingham-Gill'],Tourists being kept under coronavirus quarantine at luxury Maldives resort,"(CNN) — While there's no doubt that having your vacation interrupted by a fast-spreading virus that's infected more than 108,000 globally and killed over 3,800 is a major inconvenience, there are surely worse places to be confined than a luxury Maldives resort.

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

99,['Lilit Marcus'],Easter Island moai statue destroyed by truck,"(CNN) — One of Easter Island 's world-famous moai statues has been destroyed in an accident.

A Chilean island resident was arrested on March 1 after his truck -- a private vehicle, not a commercial one -- crashed into one of the stone figures and badly damaged both it and the ahu, or platform, it was perched on.

Local authorities believe that the accident was caused by brake failure that caused his truck to slide downhill.

On the island, which is known as Hanga Roa by its native Rapa Nui people, the enormous stone heads called moai have long been a source of intrigue and wonder.

""The damage is incalculable,"" Camilo Rapu, president of Easter Island's indigenous Rapa Nui community, told CNN in a statement.

The island's mayor, Pedro Pablo Petero Edmunds Paoa, is calling for stricter regulations that will prohibit vehicles from driving near the 1,000-odd moai on the UNESCO World Heritage-listed island.

Edmunds Paoa tried to pass an anti-driving measure eight years ago, he told Chilean newspaper El Mercurio de Valparaíso , with no effect. He believes that this week's accident could be the motivating factor to consider re-introducing the proposal.

""The Moai are sacred structures of religious value for the Rapa Nui people,"" Rapu said. ""Furthermore, [the damage of the moai] is an offense to a culture that has lived many years struggling to recover its heritage and archaeology.""

Moai were carved from solid basalt between the 13th and 16th centuries. Tourism Chile

Easter Island, a Polynesian island that is a territory of Chile, has long struggled to balance its status as a bucket list travel destination with the local Rapa Nui people's desire to protect their heritage.

If it weren't for the mask on his face, Gennaro Arma, striding purposefully along the dockside in full uniform with hat under arm, might easily have been stepping down from an uneventful trip shuttling passengers from one vacation destination to another.

But those who know him best say the steadfast calm Arma exhibited throughout the ordeal in which more than 700 people on board the ship tested positive for COVID-19 was typical.

It's why, they say, the experienced Italian sailor is now being hailed as a hero at home and abroad.

""He emerged to be exactly how people have renamed him -- 'Fearless',"" Arma's wife, Mariana Gargiulo, tells CNN Travel from her home in Sant'Agnello, a beautiful coastal town south of Naples, where the captain is due to return soon.

""He never had any problems, and I never worried because we were constantly in contact.""

The quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess has been widely criticized for intensifying the risk of infection for those stuck aboard. Many passengers were eventually airlifted out, but not before at least five people had contracted fatal infections.

Nevertheless, Arma apparently proved himself a tireless rock for his passengers and crew during their ordeal and he's been widely praised for helping lift spirits and for setting a noble example of how a captain should deal with adversity.

His support for his crew was on display right to the end when he disembarked on March 2, having overseen the final transfer of all passengers either to hospital or a quarantine facility.

He called them ""my gladiators.""

Throughout the quarantine, he also regularly thanked all passengers on board for their patience and perseverance, leaving them notes of encouragement.

Back in Sant'Agnello his friends, family, townsfolk and local authorities are waiting for Arma's return, preparing to throw him a huge homecoming party. The captain tested negative for the virus and is currently in quarantine in Japan.

His wife says the captain's calm and control during the emergency made it easier for passengers to endure being confined to their cabins. It also gave his family a sense of peace and reassurance.

""We talked each day, both by phone and video chat,"" she says. ""I could hear he was calm, that everything was fine, and I could see that he was fine. He never had any problems.

""I could see him on the ship, he was doing well, working. We had the chance to talk a bit about everything, even our family, and not just about the situation on board.""

Arma, according to Gargiulo, is a real sea dog with decades of expertise that led him to travel around the world after he graduated at a prestigious local maritime school.

""He is a man with great sea skills and know-how,"" she adds. ""His main worry has always been the well-being of his passengers. It was a good test.""

As the wife of a cruise liner captain, Gargiulo has come to share and support her husband's job. She says she's ""always been very serene"" even during the past critical weeks.

""After many years, I'm used by now to the fact that he can be away, and far away, for a long period of time.""

Gargiulo says she doesn't know what Arma's next plans will be -- whether he'll take a break or not before heading back to sea. For now, she says she's just focused on seeing him again.

""Thank you to [Captain] Gennaro for his announcements and ability to find humor in an unusual circumstance,"" wrote one guest , Au Na Tan, on Twitter.

She added that Arma was ""courageous, sympathetic and carried himself with dignity and optimism for what was an unprecedented and unique situation. Through the entire journey, he sought to bring light to our circumstances and strove to reassure us as much as he could,"" because it's true that only ""a frightened captain makes a frightened crew .""

""And then there was the gesture of handing out flowers and chocolates on St. Valentine's Day to passengers shut in their cabins,"" to make them feel better and let them know they've not been abandoned, she says. ""It must have been really hard for them.""

Passengers were thankful for the Valentine gifts and food, posting photos online of what Arma's crew provided them with.

At one point, Arma recited a quote from the Bible to guests on the power of love, taken from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians, to lift spirits and send out a message of faith and resilience.

It's not just those who endured the drama on board who have praised the captain.

His actions have resonated worldwide, especially in Italy where many people have seen him as embodying Italian endurance and the spirit of sacrifice. They've turned to social media to express gratitude and feelings in phrases such as "" proud to be Italian . Grazie!""

Another admirer says he should be ""a mandatory case history for talkative, braggart and cowardly politicians.""

UK airline Flybe went into administration March 4 , after a slump in bookings due to the novel coronavirus outbreak proved the nail in the coffin for the struggling carrier.

The low-budget airline celebrated its 40th anniversary last year and was Europe's largest independent regional airline, at one point operating more than 200 routes.

The UK government announced in January that it was in talks with the ailing carrier ""to set Flybe on a recovery path.""

However, the coronavirus outbreak in Europe meant the airline fell victim to a drop in demand for plane travel which has thrown the industry into crisis worldwide, with flights being canceled, planes grounded and airline staff across the globe forced to take unpaid leave.

British tour operator Thomas Cook, a venerable institution of 178 years' standing, collapsed in September 2019, stranding hundreds of thousands of travelers and triggering a huge repatriation effort.

Cook's increasingly old-fashioned model of selling package deals of flights on its own airlines, along with hotel rooms, from brick-and-mortar stores meant it had been struggling to compete with online rivals and low-budget upstarts.

Uncertainty over Brexit and a weak pound were also cited as contributor factors to the operator's struggles.

The airline section of the business operated with more than 100 aircraft, based in the UK, Denmark and Germany.

In March 2019, Iceland-based Wow Air, known for its wow-ingly low-priced flights between Europe and North America, abruptly shuttered and announced it was bankrupt.

""Wow had been in financial trouble, they had attempted to merge with Icelandair which failed,"" says CNN's Richard Quest. ""The writing was on the wall but Wow just continued to let people book.""

When the hoped-for merger with Icelandair fell apart at the last minute, it resulted in stranded passengers throughout Europe.

Although Wow's bright purple liveries and charismatic CEO Skuli Mogensen got plenty of buzz during its eight-year tenure, the airline might be best remembered for its spectacular demise.

US Airways

Founded in 1937 as ""All American Aviation,"" the airline rebranded to ""Allegheny Airlines"" in 1953, to ""USAir"" in 1979, when it was considered among the world's largest airlines, and finally to ""US Airways"" in 1997.

As US Airways, the carrier flew a wide domestic and international network from its hubs at Charlotte, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Washington D.C.-National airports, and bought up Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), Piedmont Airlines, and the failing Trump Shuttle.

On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 landed on the Hudson River following engine failure from multiple bird strikes. All passengers and crew survived in the event, now termed the ""Miracle on the Hudson.""

US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2013, forming the world's largest airline, with the final US Airways-branded flight landed in April 2015.

Continental's long history began in 1937 when ""Varney Speed Lines"" rebranded and refocused, from flying airmail to carrying passengers.

The airline was responsible for many historic ""firsts,"" such as hiring the first African-American pilot to work for any major US carrier (1963), inaugurating the first regular jet routes connecting islands across the Pacific (1968), flying the first non-stop route over 16 hours (Newark to Hong Kong, 2001) and offering 24-hour online support (2009).

Headquartered in Houston and with other hubs in Cleveland, Newark and Guam, Continental flew until it merged with United Airlines in 2012.

Midwest Airlines

This airline, founded in 1984 and with routes across the country chiefly from its Milwaukee and Kansas City hubs, ceased to exist in late 2010 when it merged into Frontier Airlines.

From the 1990s into the early 2000s, Midwest set itself apart from competitors by continuing to offer generous, complimentary hot meals when other airlines were cutting back on amenities.

Midwest's famous warm chocolate chip cookies, baked and served onboard every flight, outlasted the Midwest brand and continued on Frontier flights until that airline discontinued the cookie service in 2012.

ATA Airlines

Initially launching as charter company in 1973, ATA began scheduled operations in 1986 with flights from the Midwest to Florida, serving vacation routes that would ultimately become the airline's specialty despite a brief experiment with international flights.

Indianapolis and Chicago-Midway Airports served as ATA hubs. Following the economic effects of September 11, 2001, the airline suffered financial setback after setback, until declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations on April 2, 2008, with flights still in the air.

During the bankruptcy, Southwest Airlines scooped up the ATA brand, its access at LaGuardia Airport, and the operating certificate for $7.5 million.

TWA

Aloha Airlines

The end of World War II and the purchase of a military surplus plane led to the 1946 creation of Aloha Airlines, which operated flights between the US mainland and Hawaii, and to other Pacific islands.

Aloha was the main competitor to Hawaiian Airlines, but it was a fare war with the now-defunct island-hopper airline ""go!"" that drove Aloha to declare bankruptcy and cease operations in 2008.

Kingfisher Airlines

Travelers to India may be familiar with the Kingfisher brand of beer, but the name (and the beer's parent company) also entered the airline business, with Kingfisher Airlines commencing flights around India in 2005.

Its international service, to London, featured a bar in first class, and top-of-the-line entertainment systems and full-size pillows even in economy.

Consistent heavy financial losses drove Kingfisher to the brink of cessation several times, before the airline was forced to end operations in 2012 when India suspended its license and froze its accounts for non-payment of taxes.

Eos Airlines

The short-lived Eos Airlines, which existed only from 2004 to 2008, was an all-business-class carrier flying 48-seat Boeing 757s between New York-JFK and London's Stansted Airport.

It was a trend leader, heralding the slew of all-premium transatlantic airlines that also started up in the mid-2000s, like L'Avion, MAXJet and Silverjet. Before Eos could see through its plans to expand all-business-class flights to other US, European, and even South American destinations, the airline suddenly collapsed into bankruptcy.

Primera Air

Primera may have hit the headlines for its spectacularly terrible failure and stranding thousands of passengers (and even its own crew) when it ceased operations in October 2018 without warning, but the airline had been around since 2003 and was a successful charter operation before it pivoted to ultra-low-cost scheduled flights primarily on European holiday routes.

Primera's attempt to offer long-haul, transatlantic flights between the United States and Europe then literally got off the ground in April 2018, only to last a few months before the entire operation collapsed two years ago.

Monarch Airlines

Primera's failure came on the one-year anniversary of Monarch Airlines' own demise, which occurred on October 2, 2017.

The budget British airline, founded in 1967, flew vacationers to tourism hotspots around Europe, as well as to Israel.

Financial difficulties drove Monarch to desperately seek funding and, despite scoring some investment from Boeing in 2016, the airline shut down and stranded some 110,000 passengers who were later repatriated on other airlines in an operation costing £60 million ($78 million).

Air Berlin

Founded by Americans in 1978, Air Berlin initially operated holiday charter flights from West Berlin to Mediterranean vacation destinations. German reunification saw the airline rapidly expand, and Air Berlin became one of the largest European carriers.

Future plans and expansion hinged on eventually basing operations at Berlin's new Brandenburg Airport, which was originally due to open in 2011 but suffered rolling delays and is now not expected to open, if at all, until 2020.

Air Berlin scaled back on operations over several years and, with sustained financial losses, finally flew its final flight in October 2017. Nearly immediately Lufthansa swooped in and purchased 81 of its aircraft and employed more than 3,000 former Air Berlin employees, with Easyjet also taking a smaller piece of the Air Berlin pie.

Pan Am

The Pan Am Experience restaurant takes ""passengers"" back to the airline's '70s heyday complete with a four-course meal.

Pan Am, short for Pan American World Airways, is the story of a tiny, airmail carrier that hopped from Florida to Cuba and back beginning in 1927, to become the world's largest airline and an industry innovator until its demise in 1991.

Graduating from floatplanes to Boeing 747s, the airline pioneered flight routes, opened hotels (starting the InterContinental hotel chain), and symbolized the glamor of the jet age.

Oil crises, hijackings and attacks, and other operational setbacks forced Pan Am into dire financial straits, and the carrier ceased on December 4, 1991. Delta paid $1.39 billion to acquire Pan Am's assets, also honoring passenger tickets on the bankrupt carrier.

Ted

When low-cost airline literally and figuratively took off in the United States in the mid-2000s, United felt the pressure to try its own hand and thus formed Ted. The airline began flying all-economy Airbus A320s in 2004, with a hub at Denver International Airport.

In-flight entertainment on Ted flights was limited to ""Tedevision"" and ""TedTunes,"" and the airline sold teddy bears onboard. Ted's main competitors were Frontier Airlines and Delta's similar low-cost experiment, Song, and it lasted until 2009 when operations were folded back into United.

105,['Francesca Street'],What airlines are doing to sanitize planes,"But airplanes are still flying, and travelers still traveling, albeit with extra bottles of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in carry-ons.

Still, as you board the aircraft and sit in your seat, you might find yourself reconsidering inflight hygiene -- and wondering just how thoroughly the aircraft's actually been cleaned before you boarded.

CNN Travel spoke to airlines, airplane companies and medical experts to find out what's been done to ensure you're flying in as hygienic an environment as possible, and what passengers can do for extra reassurance.

Normal cleaning procedure

Christian Rooney is the manager of JetWash Aero, a specialist aviation cleaning company based in the UK that's tasked with turning around aircraft between flights.

Rooney tells CNN Travel that the cleaning process varies depending on the schedule of the aircraft in question.

When aircraft downtime is very limited, some of what Rooney calls the ""very straightforward cleaning,"" such as removing old newspapers and passenger trash, will be done by the cabin crew at the end of the previous flight.

""A basic but more thorough cabin clean is usually carried out at night -- or when there is more downtime -- and it includes the cleaning of toilets, wiping down and disinfecting of trays, cleaning galleys, [overhead bins], seats etc. This may take up to an hour or longer,"" explains Rooney.

""An airline will also always schedule a 'deep interior clean' every month or six weeks. This clean takes several hours and is extremely thorough.""

Cleaning products and disinfectants are approved by aircraft manufacturers, says Rooney.

""Some of the disinfectants we use are effective against a wide range of pathogens and are known to inactivate complex viruses with similar properties to SARS, E. coli, avian flu, MRSA etc,"" he adds.

These offer antimicrobial protection for up to 10 days, he says.

Stephanie Biron, a recently retired flight attendant who used to work for American Airlines, tells CNN Travel that, in her experience, standards of aircraft cleaning would vary.

""A lot of times you come on and it's not terribly satisfactory, but you have to rely on the individuals doing their jobs, because that's what they've been paid to do,"" she says.

""Sometimes you come on and you have to go out and tell the agent, 'look, the plane looks terrible. We need somebody to come on and redo it.' It just varies all the time. Sometimes you come on in the morning and they deep cleaned the whole thing, or at least they told you they have.""

Passenger personal hygiene

Some airlines have requested additional measures due to the current climate, says Rooney.

""We have seen an uptick in the requirements and levels of disinfection, spraying and fumigation of the cabin, as the airlines look to address concerns over the coronavirus,"" he explains.

But Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, says that he doesn't think there's much more carriers can do to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Because transmission most often occurs person to person, the inanimate environment of the airplane isn't really the problem, says Schaffner.

It's still wise, he says, to wipe down surfaces -- but ultimately it's handwashing that is the most important preventative step.

""Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle. You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth,"" Schaffner explains.

""So it's those hands we have that are the important intermediary -- and that's where I would put the emphasis. Use those wipes on your hands. That's the important thing.""

Dr Paulo Alves, who is currently attending IATA's Aviation Resilience Health workshop in Singapore -- which is working to address the overall impact of COVID-19 -- agrees with Schaffner.

""The most effective, simple measure vacationers should implement is to wash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer should be used,"" says Alves.

""It seems reasonable to wipe the tray table surface, where it is more likely for droplets to land after someone coughs or sneezes. Travelers should maintain good personal hygiene on board flights, before flights and after flights and avoid touching their face.""

Travel medicine specialist Richard Dawood agrees, and says this advice stretches to navigating airports too. ""Remain aware of where your hands have been,"" he says.

Former flight attendant Biron also expresses concern not just for passengers -- but for air crew. They're just as likely to get sick, she points out, or feel pressured to still fly while unwell.

Airlines for America, the aviation group that represents North American carriers, says airlines are working closely with federal authorities -- and tells CNN Travel that the safety and security of passengers and crew ""is -- and always will be -- the top priority of US carriers.""

""I really don't think [airlines] can do very much. They might make the wipes more available to individuals,"" says Schaffner.

Airline response

Aircraft are cleaned on the ground, between flights. Spencer Platt/Getty Images

So what are airlines doing differently right now?

Brian Parrish, spokesman for Southwest Airlines, tells CNN Travel that Southwest aircraft undergo ""regular cleanings between flights and a comprehensive cleaning when aircraft are parked overnight.""

""Our cleaning program includes the disinfecting of all hard surfaces within the cabin, as well as seat and carpet cleaning,"" he says. ""Southwest will continue to monitor and follow all guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization regarding the coronavirus and make any adjustments to our procedures, as necessary.""

Curtis Blessing, an American Airlines spokesperson, echos Parrish.

""Our aircraft, including lavatories, are cleaned on a regular basis, and the depth of the cleaning varies depending on turn times and type of flying,"" he says. ""Lavatories are cleaned, floors are spot cleaned and visible trash is removed from seat pockets on all flights.""

Transcontinental, Hawaii and international flights see a deeper level of cleaning, Blessing adds.

Meanwhile, a Qantas spokesperson tells CNN Travel that the airline adopts ""the highest standard in cleaning and disinfecting our cabins, seats, galleys and washrooms.""

The spokesperson also highlights the HEPA filters which are part of the air conditioning system. ""These filters are used in hospital operating theaters, with air in the cabin replaced every three to five minutes. This provides much cleaner air than other public spaces like trains, restaurants, shopping centers and offices.""

This echoes the official advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that, due to the way air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, ""most viruses and other germs do not spread easily,"" but that travelers are still advised to ""avoid contact with sick passengers and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol.""

Delta says on its website that it's been deploying a ""fogging technique"" since February, using ""a highly effective, EPA-registered disinfectant.""

Fogging is being used on all trans-Pacific Delta flights arriving into the US, with plans to expand those procedures to more inbound international flights, focusing on flights coming from places with reported coronavirus cases. Fogging has been taking place on all inbound Delta flights from Italy to New York-JFK and Atlanta since February 29.

Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific tells CNN Travel that aircraft cabin cleaning is always carried out to ""high standards"" -- but some extra precautions are currently in place.

""Out of an abundance of caution, aircraft will be taken out of service to perform extensive additional deep cleaning and supplementary disinfection when a confirmed case of coronavirus has been identified,"" says a Cathay Pacific spokesperson.

""This includes the replacement of all seat covers, disinfection of all surfaces and galley equipment, detailed cleaning of the lavatories, disinfection of carpets, sterilization of the water system and replacement of air filters in addition to standard cleaning procedures.""

Cathay Pacific has also temporarily suspended hot towels, pillows, blankets, magazines and in-flight duty-free on flights to and from destinations in mainland China.

Still, Schaffner says panicked passengers shouldn't feel they need to avoid using in-flight blankets or pillows if they are provided on their flight. There's ""no good data"" to support the idea they're responsible for transmission, he says.

""It's a consideration that comes logically to the mind, but it's difficult to convince people that they're really low risk. I always come back to the intermediate vehicle [which is] your hands. Do a lot of good hand-sanitizing.""

Alves agrees, pointing out that viruses will be eliminated when blankets and pillows are washed. However, he does clarify that there are ""knowledge gaps"" about the COVID-19 virus and research is ongoing, so recommendations may change.

Staying vigilant

So if you're boarding a flight soon, stocking up on hand sanitizer is the best move. Is there anything else to be done?

Schaffner notes that, from the passengers' point of view, the ultimate way to avoid infections on aircraft is to stay home.

""And there will come a time perhaps -- and some of that is happening already -- where we are being urged to social distance ourselves,"" he says. ""People are reconsidering whether they wish to fly at the moment.""

Grinning vacantly, he leans against a wall emblazoned with a quote from Franz Kafka: ""There is an infinite amount of hope in the universe ... but not for us.""

This is your welcome to "" The Misanthrope Society ,"" a bar that offers drinkers and diners a respite from other people.

The quirky addition to Taipei's bar scene serves up creative cocktails, black humor and a dislike of humankind.

Its cocktails sound bleak: ""Ghost Island Tea"" has Taiwanese Spring Vodka and Kavalan Whisky, plus dashes of tequila, kahlua, vermouth and lemon juice; ""Kafkaesque"" blends together ""Kaffe und Wodka"" and other spirits with root beer.

A mix of Midori, sake-based Mikanshu, cherry brandy and Absolut Vodka comes up with ""No Longer Human.""

The cocktails have names like ""Ghost Island Tea"" and ""Last Words."" courtesy The Misanthrope Society

If you order the gin-based ""Last Words,"" you are politely asked to write down what you will say on your deathbed to add to a pile of cards in the bar. ""Stay ridiculous,"" reads one.

The bar itself is characterized by dark humor and dark décor: black walls, a black menu, black plates -- even the fried chicken is black, after being marinated in traditional Taiwanese fermented bean curd, splashed with alcohol and set alight.

Diners are left to watch flames shooting out of what looks like black remains, a fried chicken dish that evokes the image of hell.

As if you didn't get the message, ""Hell is other people,"" the famous quote from Jean-Paul Sartre, is painted on a wall.

""You can hate this world as much as you want""

The anti-social theme of the bar belies its inclusiveness; the owner, who has suffered from severe depression, wanted to provide a space that was welcoming to others in need.

""We call it 'The Misanthrope Society,' which literally means you can hate this world as much as you want here,"" says Chen Xiaoguai.

""I want to attract people with the dark side,"" so they can then help each other and experience ""the warmth from different people,"" he adds.

""The Misanthrope Society"" is located in one of Taipei's most happening districts, bang in the middle of a bustling night market selling clothes and snacks, and less than a minute's walk from the Gongguan metro station.

But owner Chen has managed to find a space that is perfect for a bar that professes to hate human society, in a dark corner of a road that leads nowhere, where no sunshine reaches.

Inside, though, is some hidden human warmth.

Chen was inspired to open the bar after spending a month in a mental health hospital.

There he received specialist care from psychologists and other health professionals, but felt like the system stopped providing support after he was discharged.

""I think the most important thing in my case in stepping out from the dark side is the help from people, the friends I met in hospital,"" says Chen, who used to be an engineer.

""I want to replicate this peer support group.""

However, many people with depression choose not to drink alcohol because it makes their symptoms worse or mixes badly with their medication.

At The Misanthrope Society, you can get that sense of community without the booze, as the bar is also a coffee shop and bookstore, offering psychology books, autobiographies and novels about dark episodes in people's lives. Books lined up on a coffee bar include ""The Museum of Broken Relationships"" and ""Poetry About How Much I Hate My Life.""

Since opening the space in February last year, Chen says people ""came here to cry, to talk to me, to just stay, read my books.""

More than a dozen regulars who experience similar mental health issues have got to know each other and formed their own support network.

In Taiwan, mental health is not talked about much and is often still misunderstood and stigmatized.

""Before, these people probably can only talk to their family, their friends, who can't really understand them, especially our parents, the older generations, who have no idea or knowledge of mental health problems,"" says Chen, 28.

Older generations might suggest problems can be solved by talking to a temple official, or through superstition.

""The Misanthrope Society"" offers an outlet for all drinkers and diners to express their mood, and that starts with what you order.

The ""furiously stewed"" duck may appeal to those feeling angry, while the Scotch egg's Chinese name translates as ""withdraw into one's shell.""

Chen was once asked to create a cocktail for ""the feeling of being enslaved by society."" He created one ""opaque in color, strong in flavor.""

It would be wrong, perhaps, to call this an anti-bar, as many lone drinkers have sought out solace from other people in bars the world over.

108,['Andrea Lo'],Luxembourg makes all public transport free,"(CNN) — With a population of 602,000 , Luxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries -- yet it suffers from major traffic jams.

But that could be about to change. As of March 1, 2020 all public transport -- trains, trams and buses -- in the country is now free.

The government hopes the move will alleviate heavy congestion and bring environmental benefits, according to Dany Frank, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mobility and Public Works.

Tiny country, big traffic

Landlocked Luxembourg is one of the richest countries in Europe, with the highest per capita GDP in the European Union

High housing costs, especially in Luxembourg City, mean more than 180,000 of its workforce commute from those neighboring countries every day.

""Luxembourg is a very attractive place for jobs,"" explains Geoffrey Caruso, a professor at the University of Luxembourg and the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research specializing in land use and transportation.

But its ""booming economy"" and high concentration of jobs have led to congestion issues, he says.

That year, drivers in Luxembourg City spent an average of 33 hours in traffic jams. It fared worse than European cities Copenhagen and Helsinki , which have comparable population sizes to all of Luxembourg -- yet drivers in both only spent an average of 24 hours in traffic.

Park and rides around Luxembourg's borders in the three neighboring countries, however, will encourage commuters to use free mass transit, according to Frank.

Free transport for all

Luxembourg's public transport system covers the whole country and costs $562 million (€508 million) per year to run. Each year, it generates around $46 million in ticket sales, according to the ministry.

The government is putting up the cost of making it free, Frank says. ""The country at this very moment is in really good shape. We, the government, want the people to benefit from the good economy.""

Caruso is concerned that making transport free may unintentionally deter people who would normally walk or cycle in urban areas. ""Rather than walking 500 meters, you see a bus coming and you say, 'I (can) get on and travel 500 meters because it's free,'"" he says.

He adds, however, that the new scheme can signal important changes ahead when it comes to Luxembourg's reliance on driving.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/AkPzls5QeGQ/index.html,CNN,Travel,True
109,['Alec Snyder'],National Museum of American Jewish History files for bankruptcy,"(CNN) The National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to court documents.

The museum -- which was founded in 1976 and is a Smithsonian affiliate -- announced it will continue operating while undergoing reorganization, according to a news release issued Monday.

""The future is only likely to get better and brighter,"" interim CEO Misha Galperin told CNN on Monday. ""It's a very important, historic place where the nation was born and we're here to tell the nation what American Jews are grateful for, what was done for us in America and what we in turn contributed to the United States.""

Galperin said most of the museum's $30 million in debt stems from loans the museum took out to fund the construction of its new building on Independence Mall between 2008 -- at the height of the economic recession -- and 2010, when the building was completed. Outside funding levels declined sharply due to the recession, necessitating the loans, officials said.

""[Funding] didn't return until the levels of pre-2008 until about a year ago,"" Galperin said. ""In order to finish construction, the museum had to borrow money and we were hopeful we could repay the money. We never could.""

111,['Lilit Marcus'],Are fat fliers being discriminated against by airlines?,"(CNN) — Earlier this year, a family of three women from New Zealand -- a mom and her two adult daughters -- made headlines around the world when they were denied the business class seats they'd paid for on a Thai Airways flight because they were too big to fit into them.

Ironically, the family -- Huhana Iripa and daughters Tere and Renell -- had purchased business class seats because they'd assumed those would be bigger and more comfortable.

But because Thai Airways' plane seat models made it impossible to put seatbelt extenders onto business class seats, the three women were moved into coach class and given seatbelt extenders.

While the Iripas' story went viral and resulted in a refund from the airline for the difference in cost between the business seats they'd paid for and the coach ones they ended up flying in, stories like these are not anomalies.

As airplane seats continue to shrink, more and more people around the world find themselves unable to fit -- or else subject to invasive comments, touches and other humiliations by both airline employees and their fellow passengers.

Adding to the challenges, there is no universal standard in seat sizing for the airline industry. Every airline has different guidelines, meaning that even the best-informed consumers have trouble keeping up.

But there are ways to make flying -- which can be anxiety-producing for even the most mainstream traveler -- more humane for everyone on board, no matter what their body looks like.

The goalposts are moving

Annette Richmond is a body-positive activist and the founder of Fat Girls Traveling , a digital community that provides women with support, advice and resources about traveling with different body types.

As a self-described ""digital nomad"" with no official address, she has clocked thousands of hours in the sky and has dealt with a range of situations on board. She's also plus size herself.

Though her own number-one piece of advice is to do as much research as possible about your flight, carrier and seat ahead of time, she admits this can be challenging. The rules are frequently changing and not always posted in an easy-to-find place.

Related content What we resolve not to do on a plane in 2020

""(Airlines) intentionally make it difficult and make sure it takes time and money and effort for you to travel comfortably as a fat person, because they're there to make a profit,"" Richmond says.

Some countries have specific regulations about body size and air travel rights. For example, travelers flying on domestic flights within Canada who need two seats can get the cost of the second seat refunded if they have a doctor's note.

In Australia, the Australian Consumer Law prohibits airlines from charging passengers different amounts based on their body sizes.

Colorado-based startup Molon Labe Seating is developing a staggered seating design for commercial airlines which they claim provides passengers with more room and larger seats.

But in the United States, it's a gray area.

AirHelp.com is a US-based website that helps consumers take action against airlines in situations like these.

The company's chief legal officer, Christian Nielsen, says that passengers who have had negative interactions with airlines regarding seat size have to deal with regulations that change constantly or are difficult to articulate.

""There are not many laws to protect people who do not fit into shrinking airline seats,"" Nielsen tells CNN. ""There is no law currently in place (in the United States) to protect passengers who are bumped from their flight due to their size.""

When Lauren Haber Jonas founded Part + Parcel , a community platform and online retailer for plus size women, she was determined to make sure her company's values for her employees matched the ones they were instilling for their customers.

She vowed that any Part + Parcel employee on a work trip would be accommodated in their seat and travel preferences -- whether that means two seats, using extenders or anything else that a person of size would prefer to make flying more comfortable.

But she found that it was hard to know what the guidelines were in order to follow them.

""It's a disaster,"" she admits. ""Every airline has different configurations and policies, but every airplane has different seats. The age and the model of the plane, and if the model has been remodeled, and and and. I have found myself spending many hours looking at widths and dimensions of first class versus business class versus coach on every plane you can possibly imagine.""

It's not just about the seat

One thing is for sure: conversations around body size and airplane seat sizes aren't going away.

In December 2019, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine predicted that half of Americans will be obese by the year 2030, with one in four having a body mass index (BMI) of over 35.

But while bigger bodies are everywhere, that doesn't mean that social attitudes have changed.

""I feel like when you live your life in a marginalized body, a fat body or a disabled body or an older body, something that's outside of the generalized norm, you get used to being othered all the time and you have to walk through the world with an additional armor,"" says Richmond.

The term ""microaggressions"" is used to explain how little slights that might otherwise not seem like a big deal accumulate over time to turn into an issue.

For plus-size people, it's not just about one particular seat on one particular airplane.

Despite being an activist, Richmond can often get so worn down by the nonstop questions and comments -- from cabin crew, from fellow passengers, and even from total strangers -- that she just gives in.

Related content 9 things that will make flying on an airplane better

In one case, when she says was asked by a crew member to move out of an exit row seat despite being able to fit safely into the seatbelt, she just said yes to avoid a conflict and because she didn't want to have to ""prove"" her body was an acceptable size.

Richmond feels that the reason there hasn't been a significant movement to make travel more comfortable for people with larger bodies is because we live in a society that considers fatness a moral failing and something that doesn't deserve sympathy.

On the other side, for example, it's considered a positive trait to be tall -- so tall passengers who complain about lack of leg room are seen as having a more valid complaint.

""There are statistics all the time that say that 80 percent of people (in the United States) hate plus size people,"" says Haber Jonas. ""In being a plus size person, it's the sense that you did this to yourself. You made yourself fat, you created this body, it's imposing on me and it's your job to make yourself smaller.""

And tensions that could be resolved easily on the ground become urgent issues in the air, when there's no way for people to get away from each other and avoid sharing space.

Being stuck in a flying tube together often can turn a mildly uncomfortable situation into a crisis.

l e v a r t

""The fact that [air travel] gets worse and worse over time means that people are more and more pissed off. You enter the experience unhappy -- there are no plugs at the gate, the boarding experience is miserable, it's no wonder that you get upset. If you get upset about a person of size, it's about how it affects you and your life and your day, you don't think outside of yourself.""

Ultimately, it's much easier to get annoyed at a fellow passenger instead of pulling back and thinking about the structural issues in the aviation industry affect all travelers.

After all, you can't yell at a structural issue.

What happens next?

Unless there's a huge transformation of the airline industry, seat sizes and configurations aren't likely to change soon.

The time and cost involved in building aircraft mean that changes happen gradually, sometimes over years. And in-flight comfort is often sacrificed at the altar of the lowest fare.

For those in cattle class, enlisting a high-profile ally can often be a support.

In 2010, ""Clerks"" director Kevin Smith was removed from a Southwest Airways flight to Burbank because a crew member said he needed an additional seat.

Smith went on a rant against the airline, which he posted in a series of tweets.

""Dude, I know I'm fat,"" he said at the time. ""That's not why I was truly thrown off that plane, because I fit perfectly in the seat ... I am not fat enough to eject off a Southwest flight.""

Later, Southwest changed its policy, citing Smith's experience as part of their reason why. And, six years later, he flew the airline again with no issues.

Richmond also advocates for the power of community. Often, if a member of Fat Girls Traveling has had an issue with a specific airline or travel company, members will back each other up online.

NORTH ISLAND

Cape Reinga

Cape Reinga is the end of the road when it comes to the North Island -- the only place further north is North Cape, which isn't open to the public.

Stand beside the iconic Te Rerenga Wairua lighthouse on this rocky, windswept point and you'll see where the Tasman Sea (between New Zealand and Australia) and the Pacific Ocean meet.

You'll also be bearing witness to a sacred place in Maori culture. An 800-year-old pohutukawa tree at Cape Reinga is believed to be the last leaving place for spirits of dead Maori.

Legend has it that they leap from this tree into the ocean to begin their journey back to their ancestral homeland of Hawaiki.

Auckland

Auckland: New Zealand's biggest and most culturally diverse city. Chris McLennan/Tourism New Zealand

There's lots to see and do in New Zealand's biggest and most culturally diverse city.

The 'City of Sails' sprawls around more than 40 volcanic cones and is surrounded by the island-strewn Hauraki Gulf.

Auckland has a metropolitan vibe, but it's also blessed with bountiful beaches, parks and places to get away from it all.

When you need a break from the hustle and bustle, walk to the top of Maungakiekie (Mt Eden). Here, just 5km from the CBD, you will enjoy panoramic views from the city's highest volcanic cone while sheep graze peacefully nearby.

Bonus trip: Make sure you include a trip to Waiheke Island -- just 40 minutes from the terminal in Auckland -l- for a complete change of pace. Waiheke is home to idyllic beaches, bushwalking trails and 20-odd vineyards.

Lake Taupo + Tongariro National Park

A lake the size of Singapore? Check. Volcanoes? Check. Bubbling mud and steaming hot water pools? Check. Bleak, barren desert landscapes? Check.

Lake Taupo and its surrounding landscapes read like they've been purpose-built for a tourism brochure. The freshwater lake, which is the biggest in Australasia, is a vast caldera formed by a super-volcanic eruption some 26,000 years ago.

At the southern end, three mighty volcanoes (Mounts Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngaruahoe) loom large. It's no wonder that nearby Tongariro National Park (a World Heritage Area) was used as the backdrop for some of the most stunning scenes in the Lord of the Rings films.

Many visitors choose to base themselves in Taupo, the town on the lake's northern shores. There's no shortage of outdoor experiences on offer here, including fishing, mountain biking, skydiving, jet-boating and bungee jumping.

In winter months, all eyes are on the mountains. There are two fields on Mount Ruapehu (Whakapapa and Turoa) and plenty of apres-ski fun to be had in the small town of Ohakune.

Bonus trip: Get up close (okay, not too close!) with steaming mineral pools and bubbling mud at the Tokaanu Thermal Walk (near Turangi, 40 minutes from Taupo), then take a dip in the healing waters of the nearby geothermal hot pools to soothe away any travel-induced aches and pains.

Lake Waikaremoana + Te Urewera

Remote and rugged Te Urewera is the largest protected tract of native forest in the North Island: Think dense, rugged bush, vast Lake Waikaremoana (formed more than 2000 years ago by a monumental landslide) and lots of potential for fishing, tramping, camping and hunting.

It's home to the Ngati Tuhoe tribe (nicknamed 'the Children of the Mist') and most species of New Zealand's native birds. If you're looking for somewhere to completely switch off, this is it.

To exercise body as well as mind, consider hiking the complete Lake Waikaremoana Track.

This trail, one of New Zealand's 'Great Walks,' traces the western side of the lake and takes around four days. Expect giant podocarp forests, remote beaches and incredible views. There are plenty of shorter hikes if you're pressed for time.

It's also home to Peter Jackson's film empire (look for the 'Wellywood' sign as you fly in or drive across the Miramar Peninsula) and the extremely kid-friendly Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand, the country's national museum.

Wellington's position at the base of the North Island, between the Tararua Ranges and Cook Strait, makes it the windiest city in the world. Prepare to be invigorated by northwesterly gusts and do as the locals do -- wear a raincoat instead of carrying an umbrella when exploring.

Kaikoura

Thanks to a deep sea trench running along its coastline, Kaikoura is one of the best places in New Zealand to see marine life. It's one of the few places in the world where sperm whales can be seen year-round, along with seals, dolphins and seabirds.

If you're keen on 'kai moana' (seafood), Kaikoura also has a reputation for the island's best crayfish (local lobster) and other fresh fish.

A huge stretch of the eastern coastline of the upper south island around Kaikoura was uplifted in a 2018 earthquake, but the town recovered despite disruption to transport links and infrastructure.

It remains an unforgettable place to visit, with the mountains looming over long, deserted pebble beaches.

Punakaiki Pancake Rocks + Paparoa National Park

The Great Coast Road between Greymouth and Westport on the West Coast of the South Island was recently named one of the world's greatest drives by Lonely Planet.

This wild, practically uninhabited stretch of coastline has near-mythical status in New Zealand, thanks mostly to its varied and unspoiled geography, down-to-earth locals and rich history.

With the pounding waves of the Tasman Sea on one side and the tropical rainforest of the Paparoa National Park on the other, the drive between Greymouth and Westport is punctuated by the famous limestone formations and blowholes at Punakaiki.

Milford Sound, a fiord carved by Ice Age glaciers, is the jewel of Fiordland National Park, a 1.2 million hectare wonderland encompassing mountains, lakes, fiords and rainforests. Rudyard Kipling called it the 'eighth wonder of the world.'

The scenery here is on such a super-sized scale -- towering cliffs, cascading waterfalls, seemingly bottomless waterways -- that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was some kind of computer-generated trickery.

Queenstown

Queenstown sets the standard for all resort party towns.

Its global reputation as a bucket-list destination comes back to three things: location, location, location. Queenstown sits on the shores of Lake Wakatipu, surrounded by majestic mountain ranges like The Remarkables.

While there's plenty to see and do in the immediate area -- especially if you're into skiing, hiking, jet-boating, bungee jumping and skydiving -- it's is also the gateway to picture-perfect towns like Glenorchy, Wanaka, Arrowtown and Alexandra.

113,['Hollie Silverman'],Travelers will face new restrictions and cancellations as coronavirus cases grow in the US,"(CNN) — Travelers entering the United States will face new protocols as cases of novel coronavirus grow around the world.

The US is expanding travel restrictions from Iran and heightening a travel advisory for certain regions of South Korea and Italy, Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday. Meantime, President Trump in a tweet on Sunday announced new screening procedures for people traveling from ""high-risk countries.""

New screening methods

There was already a ban on travel related to Iran, but the administration said Saturday that it is being expanded ""to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days."" As of Monday morning, there have been 978 cases of coronavirus in Iran and 54 deaths.

The US is also increasing the travel advisory for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level -- advising Americans not to travel to specific regions in those countries hit hardest by the virus, Pence announced through the State Department.

""Additionally we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy , and other European Nations as needed,"" Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence, told CNN Sunday when asked to clarify what Trump meant by ""high risk.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the goal is to lower the travel to and from the most impacted areas in an attempt to control the spread of the virus.

Screening is already in place for those traveling from China. Anyone who has been in China within the last 14 days requires screening.

Trump on Saturday warned Americans that although more cases are ""likely,"" most healthy people who contract the illness will recover and the risk to the average American remains low. And Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that while the administration knows there will be more cases and that it's possible Americans could die from the disease, ""the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low.""

Additional restrictive measures were announced in January and are scheduled to take effect starting at 5 p.m. ET on Monday. Those include that US citizens and permanent residents returning to the United States who have traveled to Iran within the previous 14 days must enter trough an approved airport. Foreign nationals who have traveled to Iran within the last 14 days will be denied permission to travel to the US.

Airlines suspend some operations

In response to growing concerns over the spread of the virus through international travel and dwindling demand for international flights between certain locations, some airlines have suspended operations to certain airports.

American Airlines announced Saturday that it was suspending operations to and from Milan, Italy, from New York's JFK Airport and Miami International Airport. The suspension was a result of a reduction in demand, an alert from the airline said.

Change fees have been waived for anyone who purchases travel between March 1 and March 16, the airline announced Sunday.

114,['Lilit Marcus'],London street named for Freddie Mercury,"(CNN) — A suburban London street has been renamed in honor of late musician Freddie Mercury

The street, now called Freddie Mercury Close , is located in Feltham, west London, which is where Mercury's family settled after moving from Zanzibar.

However, Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara, did not grow up on that street. The Bulsara family lived nearby at 22 Gladstone Avenue, which is marked with one of the round blue plaques that the UK uses to commemorate places that have historical connections.

The neighborhood, which is close to Heathrow Airport, is also home to a community of Zoroastrians -- the faith that Mercury's family practiced.

Before forming the rock band Queen in 1970, Farrokh Bulsara worked as a baggage handler at the airport.

A close friend of Freddie Mercury released a new version of the Queen frontman singing ""Time Waits for No One,"" accompanied only by a piano.

115,['Joshua Mellin'],Japan's snow monkeys de-stress in hot springs,"(CNN) — The Japanese macaques in Jigokudani Monkey Park begin most days with a relaxing dip in their own private hot tub.

Located in Joshinetsu Kogen National Park in Japan's Nagano prefecture, the primate-only onsen is world-famous as the preferred simian hot spring.

But life hasn't always been so simple for the snow monkeys of Jigokudani (""The Valley of Hell,"" named for its natural hot springs). They were initially forced from their habitat in the 1950s by the development of nearby ski resorts.

As a result, they moved into nearby towns and quickly found trouble, raiding fruit from local farmers' orchards. The farmers petitioned the government and were granted the right to hunt the animals.

Legend has it, the manager of Kourakukan, a nearby ryokan (a traditional Japanese inn), began feeding the animals in 1957. Enlisting the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University, the inn's manager put the monkeys on the radar of researchers as well as a Nagano Railway Company worker and local nature enthusiast, Sogo Hara.

Hara and his group visited the ryokan, which included outdoor onsen for guests' enjoyment. One day in 1961, so the story goes, an errant apple fell into the human's onsen. A young monkey tested the steamy water and emerged with the apple. He didn't exit the waters immediately, though, and many of the monkeys looked on as their buddy quietly enjoyed the water.

l e v a r t

It wasn't long before other young monkeys began mimicking the water-loving monkey's behavior.

Within months, all of the female monkeys had taken to bathing in the hot springs.

This soon led to the establishment of the Jigokudani Monkey Park in 1964, thanks to the efforts of many invested parties. Today, this is where the snow monkeys live, freely soaking in their dedicated hot springs peacefully.

Damage resulting from Typhoon No. 19 had impacted the spring's water levels and temperature but restoration work is now underway and the park is open to tourists.

The Jigokudani Facebook page offers daily updates on the restoration work and presence of the monkeys.

The snow monkeys' onsen practice isn't solely about warming their bodies or bobbing for apples -- like the Japanese and visitors to Japan, they seem to appreciate onsen for its stress-reducing properties.

Since the macaque's thick coats keep them warm, and they take a dip even when there are no apples in sight, researchers' studying the monkeys at Jigokudani believe hot springs function primarily to ease their tension.

Staff encourage the macaques to keep the park's onsen in their daily routine, offering a steady diet of soybeans, barley and, of course, apples.

Researchers also discovered the monkeys' indifference to the nearly 500 daily visitors to the park. In other words, their stress hormones did not increase as the number of park visitors increased.

Even during the busy tourist season, the monkeys meander nonchalantly about the park, climbing in and out of the hot spring as humans snap photos and ooh and ahh in delight.

Unlike some of Japan's other open animal experiences, such as Nara Deer Park, touching or feeding the monkeys is strictly prohibited. But this rule doesn't detract from the joy of sitting poolside as the macaque play leapfrog.

Meet the monkeys

Since the monkeys don't swim every day (in spite of their warm fur coats, they seem to prefer the hot springs on colder days), visitors will want to plan accordingly before heading north to the park.

A flexible itinerary is best, and January and February are prime visiting months. Fresh snow is ideal -- the monkeys are at home and perhaps at their playful best in the snowy climate. If you're lucky, you might even catch baby monkeys wrestling and making snowballs.

Time of day is a critical piece of planning, too: Jigokudani Monkey Park requires an overnight stay to catch the monkey's early morning soak. While it is possible to do it as a day trip from Tokyo, even catching the earliest train will make for a later arrival, when crowds are at their greatest, and that's if everything goes off without a hitch. If you miss seeing the monkeys, you'll wish you had allowed for more time.

The park opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. daily, with extended hours from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. seasonally.

You're better off arriving the night before you plan to visit. Stay at a ryokan, delight in its onsen and take off for the park first thing in the morning. If you can, leave time for onsen exploration beyond your ryokan, for at the base of the mountain leading to the park is a main street packed with nine unique onsens for weary travelers.

Each meant to aid a particular ailment, the onsen encourage visitors to walk the charming street in a yukata (light kimono) and wooden sandals to collect stamps on a towel passport from all the onsens. Doing so is believed to ward off evil spirits and bring divine favor. The thin strip contains no shortage of mom-and-pop restaurants eager to share their house-made versions of Japanese staples.

Getting there

Most of these inns offer complimentary morning shuttles to the Jigokudani Monkey Park's information center. To best even these crowds, early risers can trek up the scenic path themselves for a chance at some private time with the monkeys.

From the information center, the monkey's onsen is only accessible via a one-mile path through the forest, about 30 minutes each way. Unfortunately, Jigokudani Monkey Park is not accessible to wheelchairs as the final ascent consists of tight winding paths and steep steps.

Jigokudani Monkey Park's pool-side views offers visitors a delightful insight into this unique behavior. Relaxing with the chilled-out macaques is a quintessential excursion from Japan's mega-cities.

Getting to Jigokudani Monkey Park from Tokyo requires an hour and a half ride on the shinkansen (high speed train) to Nagano, then a 50-minute trip on a local train to Yudanaka station in Yamanouchi, the town the park is located in.

117,['Rob Picheta'],"Climate activists just blocked plans to expand Heathrow, one of the world's biggest airports","London (CNN) — The British government's contentious plans to build a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport have been blocked by an appeals court on environmental grounds, in a landmark victory for climate campaigners.

Judges in the closely-watched case at London's Court of Appeal said the UK government, which threw its support behind the proposal, had failed to take into account what impact the move would have on Britain's commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The decision could scupper plans to expand one of the world's busiest airports, and was celebrated on the court's steps on Thursday by a number of climate groups that had brought the legal action against the UK's Transport Secretary.

The court did not rule on the legality of a third runway itself, and Heathrow said it would appeal at the Supreme Court -- but the British government said it would not contest the verdict.

The ultimate decision over whether to fight for a third runway lies with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has long opposed the idea and once said he would ""lie down in front of the bulldozers"" to stop it going ahead.

""We have not found that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the United Kingdom's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change under the Paris Agreement, or with any other policy the Government may adopt or international obligation it may undertake,"" the judges wrote in their ruling.

""The Paris Agreement ought to have been taken into account by the Secretary of State... and an explanation given as to how it was taken into account, but it was not,"" they added.

The accord pushes signatories to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2C by the end of the century.

London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, had supported the legal action and welcomed the decision on Thursday. ""We won!"" Khan tweeted after the ruling. ""A new runway at Heathrow would have serious consequences on climate change, on air quality, on noise pollution, on road and rail networks and on the quality of life in our city,"" he added in a statement.

The move marks a new period of uncertainty in the lengthy and controversial debate over whether to build a third runway at the site -- which would have made Heathrow the world's busiest airport by current statistics.

After the verdict, the UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government will look elsewhere in exploring expansion and would not fight the decision.

""Airport expansion is core to boosting global connectivity. We also take seriously our commitment to the environment. This Govt won't appeal today's judgement given our manifesto makes clear any #Heathrow expansion will be industry led,"" he wrote on Twitter.

However, a statement from Heathrow Airport said the issue identified by the court is ""eminently fixable.""

""We will appeal to the Supreme Court on this one issue and are confident that we will be successful. In the meantime, we are ready to work with the Government to fix the issue that the court has raised,"" the airport's spokesperson said in a statement.

Lawmakers approved the proposal in 2018, but strong resistance from climate campaigners and those living near the site has loomed over the project.

The new airstrip would cross over the M25 motorway, London's busy and regularly congested outer ring road. About 750 homes in the villages of Longford, Sipson and Harmondsworth could be flattened to make way.

Johnson opposed the runway while he was Mayor of London -- should he decide to accept the court's judgment now, plans to build the airstrip would likely be doomed.

'This has wider implications'

Thursday's case was brought to the court by groups including Friends of the Earth, which described Thursday's ruling as ""an absolutely ground-breaking result for climate justice"" -- and climate groups seized on the decision as a sign of rapidly shifting attitudes towards the climate.

""This judgment has exciting wider implications for keeping climate change at the heart of all planning decisions,"" Will Rundle, head of legal at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. ""It's time for developers and public authorities to be held to account when it comes to the climate impact of their damaging developments.""

""It would have been hard to imagine this outcome even a couple of years ago,"" added Tim Crosland, director of the Plan B. Earth, which was involved in the case. ""But as the scale and impacts of the ecological crisis become clearer, with people dying and being displaced in the UK and around the world, it's vital we reject the politics of division and unite amidst adversity.""

The move was also hailed by Extinction Rebellion, whose frequent protests in London and around the world have become a notable feature of the growing climate movement.

And legal experts said the decision could be replicated around the world, as governments battle tensions between economic agendas with concerns over man-made damage to the climate.

""The last year has seen a surge in litigation across the globe associated with the effects and risks of climate change,"" Mary Anne Roff, a partner at the London law firm Clyde & Company, said in remarks sent to CNN.

""The Court of Appeal made clear that they have not decided that there will be no third runway at Heathrow. Nor have they decided that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the UK's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change,"" she added.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/_KXYEa0sEAA/index.html,CNN,Travel,True
118,['Karla Cripps'],Air New Zealand unveils economy-class sleeping pods,"(CNN) — There are people who can sleep anywhere, any time, in any position -- including upright in an economy-class airplane seat.

And then there are the rest of us. Neck pillows just don't cut it. Reclining a few inches does nothing. We need to lie flat, which is what makes Air New Zealand's prototype sleep pods so exciting.

On February 26, the airline filed patent and trademark applications for the ""Economy Skynest"" -- the result of three years of research, development and testing based on input from more than 200 customers at a hanger in Auckland.

Air New Zealand's ""Economy Skynest"" will feature six full length lie-flat sleep pods. Air New Zealand

First, the specs.

According to Air New Zealand's announcement, the Skynest will consist of six full-length lie-flat sleep pods in the Economy cabin. The exact location within the aircraft is yet to be confirmed.

Each pod will be about 200 centimeters (6.5 feet) long and 58 centimeters (22 inches) wide, and come with a pillow, sheets, blanket, ear plugs and privacy curtains. The airline is reportedly also exploring additional features such as reading lights and USB outlets.

""A clear pain point for economy travelers on long-haul flights is the inability to stretch out,"" says Air New Zealand chief marketing and customer officer Mike Tod in a statement from the airline. ""The development of the Economy Skynest is a direct response to that challenge.""

So will the Skynest actually take flight?

There's reason to be hopeful. After all, this is the airline that's already proved its commitment to making economy class more comfortable, given so many of its flights are long-haul. It launched the ""Economy Skycouch"" in 2011, allowing passengers traveling together to transform their seats into a bed.

Staff from Air New Zealand tell CNN Travel no formal certification application is in process yet, ""however we have designed the concept to meet all regulatory requirements.""

Each Skynest pod will come with a pillow, sheets and blanket. Air New Zealand

As for pricing, the airline is yet to determine the costs and is still assessing the commercial proposition and product viability.

But given there are only six pods on one aircraft, they will likely be in high demand.

""We see a future flying experience where an economy-class customer on long-haul flights would be able to book the Economy Skynest in addition to their Economy seat, get some quality rest and arrive at their destination ready to go,"" says Nikki Goodman, general manager of Air New Zealand's Customer Experience.

119,['Marnie Hunter'],Petition to airlines: Kids should sit with their parents,"(CNN) — Basic economy is fine if you're a solo airline passenger willing to roll the dice on a middle seat. For families, the lowest airfare class can be problematic.

Without seat assignments -- which increasingly come with a fee attached -- children may end up separated from their parents.

That's unacceptable, says Consumer Reports' advocacy arm.

Thursday, the non-profit research, media and advocacy organization posted an online petition ""demanding airlines put safety over profits.""

""Children 13 or under should sit with their families while flying, and should not be charged extra fees to do so,"" the petition reads. USA Today first reported on the petition.

By late Monday afternoon, the petition was approaching 50,000 signatures.

""Children need a responsible adult around and whether it's just so they can go to the bathroom in the middle of the flight or if there's an emergency, it's not safe to have a child without somebody there to take care of them,"" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports' advocacy arm.

""And no business traveler or solo traveler wants to be put in charge of a 3-year-old they don't know, and no parent wants to be seated, strapped in unable to move, that far from their child,"" she said.

If there's an emergency evacuation and a child is seated 10 rows behind their parent, ""no one believes that parent is going to calmly move forward and get off the plane"" without their child, Laitin said.

Seating issues

In 2016, the family seating issue aboard airlines was addressed in a Federal Aviation Administration bill passed by Congress that called upon airlines to look at seating children 13 and younger next to an accompanying family member at no additional cost.

The bill left some wiggle room, calling for such a policy ""if appropriate.""

Laitin says a couple of years went by with no word from the Department of Transportation on the issue.

So in September 2018, Consumer Reports filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out what action had been taken.

About a year later, the DOT responded with information it had gathered from airlines and enclosed 136 complaints it had collected from consumers over a period of about two and a half years.

""While that's not enormous in numbers compared to what they get on other things, (the complaints) were very striking,"" Laitin said. ""We're talking about 1- and 2-year-olds, we're talking about children with autism, families just having an enormous amount of problems getting seated with their children.""

The DOT decided not to direct airlines to establish family seating policies ""based on the low number of complaints received and review of airline family seating policies,"" the agency said on its website in a posting from September 2019.

Consumer Reports set up a portal in November 2019 letting consumers know they could complain about family seating issues to the DOT, copying Consumer Reports. Since that went live, about 450 complaints have been logged, Laitin said.

Airline policies

Consumer Reports' petition specifically calls out American, Delta and United.

The airlines offer basic economy fares that don't include seat assignments. The airlines have pop-up alerts around those fares to ensure that passengers are aware of those restrictions.

United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart said the carrier has adjusted its family seating procedures and policies.

In the summer of 2019, modifications were made to its seating engine ""to ensure that whenever possible that we assign children to a seat adjacent to an adult traveling on the same PNR, which is the passenger name record,"" Hobart said.

""We've essentially rolled out automatically seating families together. So we automatically scan for families who do not have seats assigned next to each other and we work to seat them together,"" Hobart said.

In cases where seats are not already assigned, the airline can make adjustments at the gate or on board the aircraft, he said.

""It's in our interest to have families sit next to each other, and it's clearly something that families care about. And we want to ensure that when they do travel with us they have a safe, friendly, enjoyable experience and this is one of ways that we can help make that happen,"" Hobart said.

Delta Air Lines encourages customers with seating questions to contact the airline ""as soon as possible to allow for the opportunity to address their concerns.""

""Regardless of the type of ticket purchased, Delta works with customers on a case-by-case basis to ensure their travel needs are met,"" the airline said in a statement.

American Airlines has been developing a process to ensure children younger than 15 are seated with an adult family member, the airline said in a statement.

""For families traveling with a child under the age of 15 who don't have a seat assignment, our system will work to seat the child with an adult in the reservation starting 48 hours after the reservation is ticketed. This ensures the child will not be assigned a seat alone,"" the statement said.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/1Dd3EfLkmHM/index.html,CNN,Travel,True
120,['Katia Hetter'],"United Airlines gives $90,000 in travel vouchers for downgrading passengers","(CNN) — United Airlines had to swap out Boeing 777 aircraft for a Saturday flight from Newark to Hawaii, resulting in a reduction of business class seats.

These aren't the passengers an airline wants to annoy.

So the airline offered miles to passengers willing to sit in a lower class of seating on the Boeing 767-300 for the 11-hour plus direct flight.

Lots of miles.

Nine passengers accepted $10,000 in travel voucher compensation each for a total of $90,000.

""Occasionally we have to change aircraft at the last minute and when that happens, we try to do the right thing and make the impact to customers as minimal as possible,"" United spokeswoman Maddie King told CNN Travel.

King confirmed that nine business class passengers volunteered to sit in a ""Premium Plus"" cabin, which offers passengers more legroom and other benefits not found in a regular coach cabin.

But she declined to confirm the compensation amount, which the ""View from the Wing"" travel blog reported as $10,000 worth of travel vouchers per passenger.

Travelers involuntarily bumped from US flights can be entitled to compensation if they have confirmed reservations, check in to their flights online, arrive at the departure gate on time -- if their airline can't get them to their destination within one hour of the original flight's arrival time, according to the US Department of Transportation.

Passengers on US domestic flights experiencing a one to two hour delay in their arrival times can receive compensation equal to double the one-way price of their bumped flight -- up to $675.

Domestic passengers experiencing more than a two-hour delay on flights will receive payments of four times the one-way value of their flight -- up to $1,350.

When they arrived at airports in Dallas, Chicago and New York, they faced long lines and confusion, several travelers told CNN.

President Donald Trump has announced foreign nationals in 26 European countries will face restrictions entering the US, while Ireland and the United Kingdom will be added to the list at midnight Monday.

The ban went into effect at midnight Friday, but only after the original announcement sparked chaos at European airports as Americans sought ways to return home before it went into place.

Director of National Institute of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci tells CNN's Brianna Keilar that he would like to see people avoid crowds and says those trying to return to the US from overseas should not all return immediately.

American citizens and permanent residents are allowed to fly into the US but must to go through one of 13 transit airports for screening, which caused backups at some of the airports.

Karen Rogers, a passenger returning from Paris by way of London, had been waiting in line for at least five hours to be screened at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and was told she would have at least another hour to go, she said Saturday night.

CNN has reached out to O'Hare International Airport but did not receive an immediate response.

US Customs and Border Protection is aware of the long lines and is already seeing success addressing the delays at some airports, acting commissioner Mark Morgan said in a statement.

""We're continuing to balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than the safety, health and security of our citizens.""

'Very close quarters'

The process in place at O'Hare has passengers ""essentially go(ing) through customs twice,"" said Ann Lewis Schmidt, a passenger returning from Iceland.

Passengers first wait in line to have their passports checked and to turn in a declaration form and medical forms for those returning from Europe, South Korea, Iran and China, Schmidt said.

Then they are taken to a separate line to undergo a screening and temperature check.

Passengers are grouped together for hours during the process, Schmidt said.

""Seems backwards, as if someone had a fever they should have been never allowed in these lines for four hours,"" Schmidt told CNN.

She described folks being in ""very close quarters ... so if we didn't have the virus before, we have a great chance of getting it now!""

Travelers who pass the screening are instructed to immediately self-quarantine at home and monitor their health as outlined in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's best practices, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Illinois governor calls on federal government to take action

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker reacted to the news of long lines by tweeting to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, ""The crowds & lines O'Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately. @realDonaldTrump @VP since this is the only communication medium you pay attention to -- you need to do something NOW. These crowds are waiting to get through customs which is under federal jurisdiction.""

Prtizker has spoken with local officials and is working to get the federal government to resolve the issue, he said.

""The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW,"" he tweeted.

In a tweet, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf acknowledged the long lines and the stress passengers were experiencing.

""DHS is aware of the long lines for passengers who are undergoing increased medical screening requirements. Right now we are working to add additional screening capacity and working with the airlines to expedite the process,"" he said.

""I understand this is very stressful. In these unprecedented times, we ask for your patience. It currently takes ~60 seconds for medical professionals to screen each passenger. We will be increasing capacity but the health and safety of the American public is first & foremost.""

Passengers told to share pens

At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, passengers are also facing long wait times.

Katelyn Deibler landed at JFK from Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday afternoon and it took more than two hours to complete customs, she said.

She was given two forms to fill out when she arrived, she said.

""One was just name, passport number, flight number, seat, address, emergency contact, and details about your trip,"" Deibler said.

CNN's Kristen Holmes describes what it was like in the White House briefing room when reporters had their temperatures checked ahead of a press conference with President Trump.

The second form asked specific questions about symptoms and travel to coronavirus hot zones, she said.

The form instructs passengers to circle countries they visited in the last 14 days and asks if they've had any symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing, Deibler said.

There were not enough copies for all the passengers on the flight, and many had to wait for more forms to be handed out.

""They didn't have pens and told us to share,"" she said. ""Which sounds like a great thing in the middle of the pandemic.""

Three taken to the hospital after screenings at JFK

Another traveler, Nick Carlin, also expressed concern passengers were told to share pens, and there was no hand sanitizer at JFK, he said.

""It definitely was a little scattered and disorganized,"" said Chris Nadolne, a passenger who arrived to JFK. ""I can see how people would start to get frustrated as the line got longer. ... No bathrooms nearby and no antibacterial around for people to use -- unlike in the UK and Paris where it is everywhere.""

At least three passengers who underwent screenings at JFK were sent to hospitals because of their symptoms, a source with knowledge of the JFK screenings said.

The average wait time for a health screening has been two hours, said Frank Russo, the JFK port director for US Customs and Border Control. There are more than 50 emergency medical technicians on duty supplementing CDC staff, he said.

Asked about passengers' complaints of the airport lacking hand sanitizer, he said the terminals have hand sanitizer and officers are instructing people how to find it. He has asked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the airport -- to install more dispensers in the areas where passengers are waiting, he said.

Passengers were intermingling while waiting in lines

Upon landing at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport , Kimberly Harris witnessed passengers who were in line for CDC screening skip the queue and join international passengers who did not need to be screened, she said. Harris returned from Johannesburg, South Africa, via London.

She watched the customs line grow and wrap around the entire floor, she said. ""It was difficult to tell where the line began and ended,"" Harris said. ""It almost (was) immediately evident that people who had to stay behind on the plane due to visiting a listed country were integrated into the line of the people who did not require additional screening.""

It took her three hours to make it through passport control and customs, she said. Another passenger who arrived at DFW on Sunday from Thailand by way of Doha, Qatar, described a similar scene. The coronavirus screening line was not separated from the other international arrivals, Matthew Thomas said.

""(They were) right next to us,"" he says. ""We were crowded and there for hours.""

128,,Coronavirus: Liverpool Left To Wait And Wonder With Premier League In Limbo,"Liverpool could have been crowned Premier League champions on Monday for the first time in a generation. Instead the stadium will be silent and the streets empty. Jurgen Klopp's team needed Manchester City to lose to Burnley on Saturday to give them a chance to seal the deal at their local rivals Everton two days later. Regardless of whether it would have happened at Goodison Park or over the coming weeks, their first top-flight title for 30 years was a mere formality. But now fans are wondering when, or even if, they will be crowned champions after the coronavirus laid waste to the global sporting calendar .

The message coming from Liverpool is that there are more important issues than football to talk about, even with the club tantalisingly close to glory.

""I've said before that football always seems the most important of the least important things,"" Klopp said in a statement on Friday.

""Today, football and football matches really aren't important at all.

""If it's a choice between football and the good of the wider society, it's no contest. Really, it isn't.""

Klopp's stance won him the support of World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who thanked him for his ""powerful message"".

Liverpool supporters, desperate to reclaim their position at the pinnacle of the English game, agree with their German manager, saying the pandemic overshadows football.

Supporters' union Spirit of Shankly is focusing on the damaging fallout from the COVID-19 virus.

""In talks with @lfc we asked for assurances that non-playing staff will not lose their pay as a consequence of shifts being cancelled,"" it said in a statement.

""We also need to keep in mind those most vulnerable. Cancelling football games means (foodbanks) will be hit hard.""

Deserving winners

Liverpool have stumbled in recent weeks, knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid and dumped out of the FA Cup by Chelsea.

But they have been peerless in the Premier League, leaving their rivals in their wake to race 25 points clear of defending champions Manchester City.

With Alisson Becker in goal, Virgil van Dijk marshalling the defence and their devastating front three of Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, Klopp's men have been irresistible.

Paul Hayward, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said Liverpool should be crowned champions for the 19th time even if no more games are played.

""If a season ends too soon, its natural winning line is the point it reached before the halt was called: emphatically so, 29 games into a 38-match campaign, which is a respectable distance,"" he wrote.

""'Voiding' the 2019/20 football season would be nonsense,"" he added. ""Handing over the trophy at any point where clubs were forced to give up would feel morally correct.""

Brighton and Hove Albion chief executive Paul Barber said if the season were to be ""frozen"" it would be unjust on Liverpool.

""Everybody in the game appreciates what a fantastic season they've had and what a wonderful team they are,"" he told the BBC.

""But equally it would be unjust for teams to be relegated when there are still eight, nine, ten games to play of the Premier League.""

But West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said if the fixtures could not be completed, the only fair solution would be to declare the season ""null and void"".

Writing in the Sun, Brady, whose club are just two places above the relegation zone, said: ""Who knows who would have gone down or come up if the games have not actually been played in full?

""A huge blow to Liverpool, who might be robbed of their first title in 30 years.""

Nobody knows when football will return but, when it finally does, many in the game hope Liverpool are given the chance to complete their long journey back to the top.",https://sports.ndtv.com/football/coronavirus-liverpool-left-to-wait-and-wonder-2195172,NDTV,Sports,True
129,,"On This Day In 2001, India's Historic Win Over Australia At Eden Gardens","In arguably the greatest fightback in Test history, India had sealed a historic 171-run win over Australia, becoming only the third side in Test history to win after being forced to follow on, on this day in 2001. A rampaging Australia under Steve Waugh headed to Kolkata for the second Test having thrashed India by 10 wickets in the first match in Mumbai. Between August 1999 and February 2001, Australia won 16 straight Tests, and before this series they beat India 3-0 on home soil in the summer of 1999-2000.

But at Eden Gardens, something surreal happened.

Australia had scored 445 in their first innings on the back of captain Steve Waugh's 110 and 97 from Matthew Hayden, however it was Harbhajan Singh who stole the show, claiming 7/123 including the first hat-trick in India's Test history.

Australia continued their surge despite Harbhajan's heroics, bundling out the home side for 171 in reply, with Glenn McGrath taking 4/18.

Waugh's men looked good to be marching to a 17th straight Test win after enforcing the follow-on. India were reduced to 3/115 and then 4/232 in their second innings - still trailing by 42 with just six wickets in hand when VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid joined hands.

The pair famously shared a 376-run stand for the fifth wicket, and put their team 334 runs in front.

VVS Laxman scored a career-best 281, while Dravid added 180.

Set an improbable 384 to win in little more than two sessions on day five, Australia were outfoxed by Harbhajan, who added six wickets to his seven from the first dig and rounded out one of Test cricket's most famous victories.",https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/on-this-day-in-2001-indias-historic-win-over-australia-at-eden-gardens-2195168,NDTV,Sports,True

""how about you amaze me and do the right thing ... have an independent investigation,"" Biles snapped on Twitter after the federation's birthday tweet.

Former national gymnastics team doctor Nassar was jailed for life for abusing more than 250 athletes, including stars of the United States' 2012 and 2016 gold medal-winning Olympic teams.

A US Senate investigation found that ""multiple institutions"" failed to adequately respond to credible allegations against Nassar, but Biles has said that USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee still owe his victims, including herself, more answers and a framework to ensure such abuses won't occur again.

""Wish they BOTH wanted an independent investigation as much as the survivors & I do,"" she tweeted earlier this month.

As Biles and other elite gymnasts ramp up their preparations for Tokyo, USA Gymnastics in January offered a $215 million (194 million euros) settlement to victims of Nassar to settle legal claims -- a plan a lawyer for more than 200 women called ""unconscionable.""

Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who is now retired, called the settlement offer ""offensive"" and accused the federation of attempting to prevent release of details which would show how Nassar was able to abuse athletes for years.

Attorney John Manley, who represents more than 180 clients with active claims against USA Gymnastics, said the settlement offer releases too many people from further claims, including the USOPC, former USA Gymnastics chief Steve Penny and former national team directors Bela and Marta Karolyi.",https://sports.ndtv.com/gymnastics/how-about-you-amaze-me-simone-biles-dig-at-usa-gymnastics-in-birthday-tweet-2195147,NDTV,Sports,True

137,,David Beckham Visits Empty Stadium As MLS Club's Home Debut Delayed,"David Beckham's six-year wait to watch his Major League Soccer club make its home debut, which was to have ended Saturday, has been extended by the league's coronavirus shutdown . But that didn't stop him and his family from visiting Inter Miami's empty stadium on Saturday. Beckham's club was to have hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy, the MLS club where the former England and Manchester United star played from 2007 through 2012, in its first match at its temporary home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Instead, the entire league has joined all major North American sports leagues and shut down its season for 30 days due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

That left Inter Miami owner and president David Beckham and his wife, Victoria, to take their four children to the empty venue and post a video on Instagram.

""Special day showing the family what we've built,"" Beckham posted as the camera made a 360-degree tour of empty Inter Miami Stadium while music of Spice Girls -- his wife's former group -- blared through the loudspeakers.

Beckham also posted messages Friday on Instagram with photos taken from the field in the empty 20,000-seat stadium.

""It's times like these when we are reminded of the things that are truly important in life,"" Beckham posted on Instagram. ""Our health. Our loved ones and looking after those that need support in our communities.

""In these moments, sports take a back seat. We must all listen to expert advice and do the right thing. Stay safe and look out for yourselves and your families.""

Inter Miami still seeks a first-ever MLS triumph, having lost 1-0 at Los Angeles FC on March 1 and 2-1 at DC United six days later.

Those matches culminated a wild six-year effort filled with setbacks and frustrations.

Beckham, 44, came to the United States in 2007, the global icon leaving Real Madrid for a deal with the Galaxy that included the option to buy an MLS expansion club at a discounted price.

Over six seasons with the Galaxy, Beckham helped raise the sport's US profile and was a major contributor to the club's 2011 and 2012 MLS Cup titles.

After retiring in 2013, Beckham decided to exercise his option for an MLS expansion team in 2014 and sought to build a soccer-specific stadium in Miami.

Struggles with city leaders and civic groups followed, location after location foiled by one problem after another, and MLS hesitated to award a franchise to a group without a stadium plan set in place.

Beckham joined with Miami-based construction magnates Jorge and Jose Mas in 2017 and that represented a turning point in his quest.

In 2018, city officials approved construction of the Miami Freedom Park complex near Miami International Airport, its centrepiece being a new 25,000-seat stadium that is expected to be ready for Inter Miami to move into in 2022.

""Everything we've tried to do to get this franchise up and running was a challenge,"" Beckham said last month.

""There wasn't one (easy) thing -- from finding the land, thinking what kind of stadium we want, what kind of players we want, what kind of manager we want, even down to what tiles we had in the showers -- everything was a challenge.

138,,Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Pledges Olympics To Go Ahead Despite Coronavirus Havoc,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday resisted pressure for changes to the Tokyo Olympics schedule even as sporting events worldwide fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic. Abe pledged Japan would host the Games as planned in July and said he had no immediate intention to declare a state of emergency over the virus outbreak, which has now seen more than 140,000 people infected across the globe and over 5,400 killed.

His comments come two days after US President Donald Trump suggested the Japanese capital postpone the Games for a year as the spread of the virus wreaks havoc on the sporting calendar.

""We will respond by closely coordinating with officials concerned, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee). There is no change in this,"" Abe told a news conference.

""We want to hold the Olympics as planned without any trouble by overcoming the spread of infections,"" he said.

Organisers, Japanese government officials and the IOC have insisted preparations are on track and there will be no postponement or cancellation.

England's football Premier League, America's NBA basketball season and the Augusta Masters golf major are just some of the competitions suspended because of the pandemic.

On Friday, Abe and Trump spoke on the phone about the outbreak and Olympics after Trump proposed a delay.

""We agreed that Japan and the US will cooperate and closely coordinate for success in the Olympics,"" Abe said, adding they had not discussed any postponement.

The Japanese parliament on Friday approved legislation that gives Abe the power to declare a state of emergency to combat COVID-19 but Abe insisted such a declaration was not yet necessary.

The coronavirus has infected more than 700 people across Japan and been linked to 21 deaths. Separately, 700 people on board a cruise ship that docked near Tokyo last month were also infected.

A state of emergency would allow local governments to require that people stay indoors, schools close and public facilities limit use.

140,,"ATK Win Record Third ISL Title, Beat Chennaiyin 3-1 In Final","A rampaging ATK claimed an unprecedented third Indian Super League (ISL) title triumph with a 3-1 victory over arch-rival Chennaiyin FC in a summit showdown that was played behind closed doors in Margao on Saturday. Javier Hernandez (10th) and Edu Garcia (48th) put ATK in the driving seat but Nerijus Valskis (69th) reduced their advantage to set up a tense end to the contest. Hernandez scored another in injury time (90+4th) to confirm a record third title. The final was held without spectators owing to the COVID-19 pandemic .

The match was off to a blistering start as Andre Schembri made a good run to the byline on the right in the first minute and found Rafael Crivellaro in the centre with a good cross, but the Brazilian mishit his effort. Schembri threatened again minutes later, this time with a pass to Valskis whose shot hit the crossbar.

ATK drew first blood with their first major sight of goal in the 10th minute.

John Johnson's cross-field ball found Roy Krishna on the left flank who delivered a good cross towards the edge of the box. Javier Hernandez, who was left unmarked, smashed a half-volley into the ground and beat goalkeeper Vishal Kaith to give ATK the lead.

The contest remained open but Chennaiyin suffered an injury setback midway through the first half. Midfielder Germanpreet Singh had to be replaced and Edwin Vanspaul took his place.

ATK went close to doubling their lead in the 23rd minute out of utter chaos inside the box which produced three back-to-back attempts.

Krishna cut in from the right and unleashed a powerful strike which was saved by Kaith. Javier Hernandez then had the ball at his feet twice, but on both occasions, his shot was blocked. Chennaiyin put pressure on the ATK defence and carved out a golden chance from a free-kick after the 30-minute-mark.

Schembri met Crivellaro's delivery into the box but Arindam Bhattacharya pulled off an excellent save to keep ATK's lead intact.

The scoreline remained 1-0 in favour of ATK at the break, but the Kolkata side had a concern of their own as Krishna had to be replaced by Mandi Sosa due to an injury.



ATK scored the all-important second goal and doubled their advantage two minutes into the second half.

Williams picked up the ball in midfield and fed Edu Garcia into the box. The Spanish midfielder beat Kaith with a neat finish from an acute angle to make it 2-0.

The Chennaiyin attack struggled to create clear-cut chances and their opponents restricted them to long-range efforts.

Lallianzuala Chhangte attempted a piledriver from outside the box before the hour mark but sent the ball wide.

Chennaiyin finally found a way past the ATK defence in the 69th minute.

Laldinliana Renthlei played a neat one-two with Anirudh Thapa on the right before sending a cross into the centre of the box.

Pritam Kotal's headed clearance fell to Jerry Lalrinzuala who passed the ball to Valskis in the centre.

The Lithuanian striker found the net with a powerful strike to score his 15th goal of the season and give Chennaiyin a lifeline.

Chennaiyin built one attack after another as the game neared full-time but the balls into the box were well dealt by ATK.

ATK got their third goal of the night and struck the final blow in the last minute of injury time.

142,,"Mobile Phone Sales to Be Hit, Say Industry Experts, as GST Hike Makes Them More Costly","With the GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, increasing the GST on mobile phones from 12 percent to 18 percent on Saturday, industry experts feel it would hit the industry and the consumers hard.

Brands are in no position to absorb this impact. ""They will, most certainly, decide to pass it on to the consumer, at least in case of high-selling models,"" said Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) stressed that the move would stymie consumption.

""The 6 percent GST increase will be detrimental to the vision of 'digital India'. Consumption will be stymied and our domestic consumption target of $80 billion (Rs. 6,00,000 crores) by 2025 will not be achieved. We will fall short by at least Rs. 2,00,000 crores,"" said Pankaj Mohindroo, ICEA Chairman.

In a letter to the Finance Minister on March 12, the ICEA had said the mobile handsets sector was in deep stress because of the supply chain disruption due to coronavirus outbreak. It was the most inappropriate time to consider GST hike on mobile phones, the industry body said.

It also said the GST hike on mobile phone might adversely affect localisation of manufacturing as well as popularisation of the country's digital payments objectives.

According to ICEA, 31-32 crore Indians who buy phones in the country will be impacted by the move.

Terming the move counter-intuitive and detrimental to the 'digital India' vision, the IDC India Research Director said, ""This is a textbook case of missing the wood for the trees. This will stunt any hope of growth in the near-term, which anyway looks challenging now due to coronavirus issue at both supply and demand ends,"" Singh told IANS.

The coronavirus outbreak, which has hampered global tech giants' 2020 plans leading to cancellation or postponement of global flagship conferences, is set to hit supplies of smartphone components from China to India at least till the second quarter of this year.

143,,Coronavirus: Indian Firms Struggling to Deal With Work From Home Scenario Amid COVID-19 Pandemic,"While it makes perfect sense for IT employees to work from remote locations via video conferencing and collaboration tools seamlessly - especially in the case of tech giants like Google or Microsoft -- workers from the non-IT companies and small and medium enterprises (SMBs) are the worst-hit in India as most of them have little or no clue about how these messaging and collaboration tools work amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Small companies -- from corporate to education verticals -- are scrambling to get their act together as new coronavirus threat has reached their premises, prompting them to send employees home who have age-old laptops, poor network and connectivity with no UPS backups and little knowledge about how to handle group chat and collaboration software like Zoom, Google Hangouts Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Flock etc.

Coronavirus Impact: Google Hangouts Meet, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex Made Free to Encourage Work From Home

Instead of halting operations, however, businesses can choose to shift towards remote working methods with teaching non-IT staff on how to use the latest digital software to connect and work, say industry experts.

The training will take some time and may hamper productivity in the short run but is a win-win situation for the non-tech companies in the long run, in case any such global emergency arises in the future.

According to a latest report by Gartner, 54 percent of HR leaders have cited that poor technology and/or infrastructure for remote working is the biggest barrier to effective remote working.

Sandy Shen, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, says that with COVID-19 disrupting the business landscape, CIOs should relook at the digital fulfilment of market demand.

""The value of digital channels, products and operations is immediately obvious to companies everywhere right now. This is a wake-up call for organisations that have placed too much focus on daily operational needs at the expense of investing in digital business and long-term resilience,"" warned Shen.

Businesses that can shift technology capacity and investments to digital platforms will mitigate the impact of the outbreak and keep their companies running smoothly now, and over the long term.

""Videoconferencing, messaging, collaboration tools and document sharing are just a few examples of technologies that facilitate remote work. Additional bandwidth and network capacity may also be needed, given the increasing number of users and volume of communications,"" informed Shen.

The IT industry's apex body Nasscom has asked the government to relax norms for a month to allow work-from-home for technology and back-office employees as a measure to deal with the spread of COVID-19 in India.

Networking giant Cisco said that it has seen ""significant growth"" in the usage of its web conferencing and video-conferencing service Webex in India.

According to Muneer Ahmad, Business Head, ViewSonic India, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the corporate and educational sector is severely getting affected in the country.

""ViewSonic IFP has a cloud-based software which help teachers and corporates to connect through video conferencing to multiple people at the same time and can split the screen into six screens. It can also connect with various tools like Skype, Cisco WebEx, Zoom, Google Hangouts and GoToMeeting,"" Ahmad told IANS.

Co-working sector has also taken a hit and the industry is looking at several measures to tackle it -- from ensuring supply of juices rich in Vitamin C to supply of disinfectants and giving work from home facilities.

""The scheduled visits of the clients at our co-working offices have been postponed. Few of our clients have cancelled their outstation meetings and have now started audio/video conferencing for virtual meetings,"" said Nakul Mathur, MD, Avanta India.

147,,Elon Musk Tells Staff Car Crashes Are Deadlier Than Coronavirus: Report,"Amid the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus which has killed nearly 5,000 people in the world, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to be dancing to his own tune, underplaying the danger from the threat time and again.

In a memo to SpaceX employees on Friday, Musk said that they were far less likely to die from COVID-19 than car crashes, BuzzFeed News reported.

Musk added in the email that he does not think COVID-19 is ""within the top 100 health risks in the United States"".

In the US, over 1,600 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported, while more than 40 people have died due to the disease caused by the virus.

According to a report in The New York Times that cited an estimate by health officials, if the spread of the novel coronavirus is not contained soon, between 160 million and 214 million Americans may become infected in the worst case scenario.

This is not the first time Musk has underplayed the danger from COVID-19.

In a tweet last week he said that ""the coronavirus panic is dumb.""

It's not that he did not explain why he thought so. In replies to a Twitter user's question, he said that both the virality of COVID-19 and fatality rate are overstated.

""Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality. Keep extrapolating & virus will exceed mass of known universe,"" the tech billionaire reasoned.

""Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high,"" Musk said.

First one should be the Pixel 4a series, successor to the Pixel 3a series lunched last year, and the Pixel 5 series, which is expected to launch later in October. Information regarding both the phones has surfaced online, and the Pixel 4a is reported to support UFS 2.1 storage for faster app loading and files transfer. The Pixel 5, on the other hand, is reported to not offer flagship-level specifications this time around, and it may be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC.

Starting with the Pixel 4a, XDA Developers report that the upcoming device will support UFS 2.1 storage, instead of the eMMC flash storage found on the predecessor Pixel 3a. YouTuber Julio Lusson shared the bootloader screen of the Pixel 4a that showed a line that read “Ufs: 64GB SKHynix.” With this, the publication determined that the Google Pixel 4a pre-production unit with Lusson has the 64GB UFS 2.1 H9HQ53AECMMDAR-KEM from SK Hynix integrated. This is a strong indication that Google is making the shift to UFS storage with Pixel 4a, bringing better power management, better read and write speeds, and faster app loading and installation. However, Google may or may not integrate it in the final unit, so it's best to take things lightly for now.

Lusson also shared access to a pre-release version of the Google Camera app from the Pixel 4a pre-production unit with 9to5Google, and the teardown of the app reveals that the Pixel 4a may include a telephoto lens. The Pixel 4a is referred to as “photo_pixel_2020_midrange_config” inside the app, and there's code that reads SABRE_UNZOOMED_TELEPHOTO — hinting at a telephoto lens. Pixel 5, expected to release later in the year, is referred to as “photo_pixel_2020_config” inside the Google Camera app. The teardown reveals that the Pixel 5 may have two codenames – Bramble and Redfin.

If we are to backtrack a few months, a report had suggested that Google's Bramble and Redfin phones may be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC. At that time, these phones were speculated to be the Pixel 4a, but this new teardown suggests that they belong to the Pixel 5. All of this means, the Google's Pixel 5 phone may break the tradition and not be powered by Qualcomm's flagship chipset, but instead be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC, a popular second-best option with built-in 5G support. Of course, this is very early speculation, and Google still has plenty of time to fiddle around before making final calls.

But none of that is available on Hotstar — or Disney+ Hotstar, depending on how it's feeling — even a day later, despite all the Disney+ originals being released in India earlier this week on Wednesday.

That signals that Hotstar has paused the weekly rollout of new Disney+ content in India. Gadgets 360 has reached out to Hotstar for confirmation and comment on when the moratorium is expected to be lifted. After abruptly dropping everything on Wednesday, it's unclear why Hotstar has now decided to not push out new content, especially in the case of the seven aforementioned series, which are already available on Hotstar. The last new episode for each series is from the Friday before. It's a curious choice, to say the least, though it does fit the pattern set by Hotstar — one of utter confusion.

Hotstar has completely bungled the launch of Disney+ in India. A bit of catch-up for those who need it. Early Wednesday, Hotstar pushed out all Disney+ originals as it finished rebranding its apps to “Disney+ Hotstar”. But it then changed its mind later that day. The content was hidden from search, the rebranding largely disappeared — depending on when and where you access it, the app icon might read “Hotstar” or “Disney+ Hotstar” — though the new blue colour theme stayed. Hotstar said the new app was in beta test until the full launch on March 29, but that seemed like a cover-up for its faux pas.

Some of those concerns were expected to be addressed at a launch event in Mumbai on Friday, which was cancelled at the last minute, citing the ongoing coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. And after the BCCI's decision on Friday to postpone the start of the 2020 Indian Premier League season until mid-April in the wake of growing concerns around the pandemic, Disney+'s official arrival in India could get delayed, given its desire to time Disney+'s India launch with the start of IPL. Hotstar has not responded to Gadgets 360's multiple requests for comment on a possible launch delay.

Owing to all that, it's easily possible that Hotstar subscribers in India might not see any new Disney+ content until mid-April. After a pleasant Wednesday surprise, Hotstar has switched back to regular programming: letting its users down.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/news/hotstar-disney-plus-india-content-paused-launch-no-weekly-shows-movies-2194889,NDTV,Tech,True
154,,Facebook to Shut Down MSQRD AR Face-Filtering App,"Facebook has announced to shut down its Augmented Reality (AR) face-filtering app called MSQRD.

On April 13, Facebook will remove the app from both the Android and iOS app stores.

Facebook acquired MSQRD in 2016 and the AR app played a key role in enhancing the company's portfolio of AR image and video tools like 'Spark AR' that lets users create custom face filters for Facebook and Instagram.

""MSQRD was fundamental to building early momentum for AR and providing insights to build the platform Facebook has today,"" the company said in a statement late Friday.

""Our focus is now on delivering you the best-possible AR experiences through Spark AR, the platform that allows anyone to create their own AR effects and share them across the Facebook family,"" it added.

People can still find AR effects directly within Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Portal.

Today, Instagram and Snapchat offer several in-built face-swapping tools.

Fuelled by Snapchat Lenses and Facebook Stories, AR is gaining fast traction.

Facebook is currently building its own operating system (OS) from scratch that will power its hardware: mainly AR and virtual reality (VR) headsets like Oculus and video calling devices like Portal that currently runs Google's Android OS.

By moving to its own OS, Facebook could integrate more indigenous features into its devices, and hopefully privacy, creating a custom OS for its AR glasses or Portal devices.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/facebook-to-shut-down-msqrd-ar-face-filtering-app-2194861,NDTV,Tech,True

""Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,"" the tweet said, referring to San Francisco and surrounding communities.

Trump thanked Google while declaring a state of national emergency due to the deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Google is helping to develop a website ""to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,"" Trump said.

Google has a large team of engineers devoted to the project, and has made significant progress, according to Trump.

""Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and help all Americans impacted by this,"" Trump said.

""Again, we don't want everybody taking this test. It is totally unnecessary. And this will pass.""

A launch date for the website should be known by late Sunday, according to Vice President Mike Pence.

""You can go to the website, type in your symptoms and be given direction whether or not a test is indicated,"" Pence said.

160,,Bill Gates Steps Down From Microsoft Board,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates leaves board

Microsoft on Friday announced that co-founder Bill Gates has left its board of directors to devote more time to philanthropy.

The 64-year-old stopped being involved in day-to-day operations at the firm more than a decade ago, turning his attention to the foundation he launched with his wife, Melinda.

Gates served as chairman of Microsoft's board of directors until early in 2014 and has now stepped away entirely, according to the Redmond-based technology giant.

""It's been a tremendous honor and privilege to have worked with and learned from Bill over the years,"" Microsoft chief executive and company veteran Satya Nadella said in a release.

""Bill founded our company with a belief in the democratizing force of software and a passion to solve society's most pressing challenges; and Microsoft and the world are better for it.""

Nadella said Microsoft would continue to benefit from Gates' ""technical passion and advice"" in his continuing role as a technical advisor.

""I am grateful for Bill's friendship and look forward to continuing to work alongside him,"" Nadella said.

Computing and compassion -

Gates left his CEO position in 2000, handing the company reins to Steve Ballmer to devote more time to his charitable foundation.

He gave up the role of chairman at the same time Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO in 2014.

Regularly listed among the world's richest people, William H. Gates was a geeky-looking young man when he and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft in 1975.

Gates grew up in Seattle with two sisters. His father William was an attorney and his late mother Mary was a schoolteacher and chairwoman of United Way International.

He began programming computers as a 13-year-old student, and fell in love with the machines.

Among the tales told about Gates is that while working on school computers, he tinkered with programming to put himself in classes made up mostly of girls.

With his parents' blessing, Gates dropped out of Harvard to start ""Micro-soft"" with his late childhood friend Allen.

A key move was to focus on licensing software to computer makers in numerous ""partnerships"" that resulted in affordable machines being available to the masses.

As the personal computer market grew, Microsoft became the world's top software company. Its virtual monopoly led to a much-publicized antitrust trial, in which the company managed to avert a break-up but had to endure years of government monitoring.

Gates went on to turn his attention from software to fighting disease and other humanitarian challenges with his wife, under the auspices of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

""This move is not surprising to the Street as Gates has continued to focus more on his myriad of philanthropies across the globe over the past decade,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors.

""Gates is a historic figure in the technology world and his legacy at Microsoft will be felt in Redmond for decades to come.""",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/bill-gates-steps-down-from-microsoft-board-2194756,NDTV,Tech,True

Now in its 31st year, Apple WWDC 2020 will take on an entirely new online format packed with content for consumers, press and developers alike.

""The current health situation has required that we create a new WWDC 2020 format that delivers a full program with an online keynote and sessions, offering a great learning experience for our entire developer community, all around the world. We will be sharing all of the details in the weeks ahead,"" he added.

""With all of the new products and technologies we've been working on, WWDC 2020 is going to be big,"" said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering.

The WWDC 2020 programme will provide Apple's entire global developer community -- which now includes more than 23 million registered developers in more than 155 countries and regions -- and the next generation of app developers with the insights and tools needed to turn their ideas into a reality.

""I look forward to our developers getting their hands on the new code and interacting in entirely new ways with the Apple engineers building the technologies and frameworks that will shape the future across all Apple platforms,"" Federighi added.

Apple also announced it will commit $1 million to local San Jose organisations to offset associated revenue loss as a result of WWDC 2020's new online format.

Developers have earned over $155 billion since the App Store launched in 2008.

With an active installed base of more than 1.5 billion Apple devices, WWDC 2020 will allow developers to learn about the new technologies and frameworks they rely on as they create new app experiences in areas including augmented reality, machine learning, health and fitness, home automation and more.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that travel bans enacted last week have helped curb transmission, but that U.S. citizens would have to make personal sacrifices and comply with government guidelines to avoid a “worst-case scenario.”

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Dr. Fauci cautioned, “Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.”

While the Trump administration has banned international travelers coming from high-risk countries and regions, such as China, Iran, and much of Europe, Dr. Fauci said domestic travel restrictions hadn’t been seriously discussed.

“I don’t see that right now or in the immediate future,” he said on “This Week.” “But remember, we are very open-minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public.”

The administration’s evaluation of the virus’s impact comes as many companies, universities and school districts are already announcing voluntary closings and suspension of normal operations. Last week, over a dozen states began to shutter public schools, and colleges and universities worldwide announced class suspensions and plans to move to online instruction.

In an interview with Brianna Keilar on CNN, Dr. Fauci said that progress was being made with companies like Walmart and CVS to improve diagnostic and testing capabilities. But he cautioned that disruptions to daily life were likely to continue.

“For a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States,” he said. “We have to just accept that if we want to do what’s best for the American public.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/coronavirus-live.html,NY Times,World,True

Mr. Gantz responded witheringly to the idea. “Netanyahu, let’s not manipulate the public,” he wrote on Twitter. “If you’re interested in unity, why postpone your trial at 1 a.m. and send an ‘emergency unity’ outline to the press, instead of sending your negotiating team to a meeting? Unlike you, I will continue to support every appropriate governmental measure, leaving political considerations aside. When you get serious, we can talk.”

The delay of Mr. Netanyahu's trial set off a wave of criticism on the Israeli left. “We have the Italian mafia here, and how,” Yariv Oppenheimer, a former director of Peace Now, wrote on Twitter.

And Nitzan Horowitz, leader of the Meretz party, said, “Courts and parliamentary operations must not be suspended, even in emergencies.”

The written order by the justice minister, Mr. Ohana, had a duration of a single day, but a spokesman said officials would reassess the situation late Sunday and decide whether to extend it.

165,['Andrew Higgins'],‘Here I Can Be My Own Dictator’,"His readiness to join the Kremlin’s land giveaway has caused dismay among some like-minded critics of the Kremlin. Appearing last year on Ekho Moskvy, a radio station popular with Russia’s liberal intelligentsia, he faced repeated questions about how a dogged foe of the authorities like himself could join the settlement project.

“I am not supporting Putin’s program,” he said. “I am using it. I’m doing this for myself.”

Aside from going online to apply for the land and filling in official forms testifying to his readiness to develop it, however, Mr. Lunin has so far done very little. He has hammered wooden stakes wrapped with red plastic tags into the frozen ground to mark the boundary of his territory but has done nothing substantial to develop it as required by the program’s rules.

He planned to start last summer but, with only a tent to shelter in during a long and violent storm, he fell ill and retreated to his rented apartment in Blagoveshchensk, the nearest city. He said he will try again this summer and has grand plans to one day grow his own food, cultivate fruit and vegetables for sale, and build a two-story wooden house next to a small lake at the property’s edge.

To do this, however, he needs money.

With a monthly salary of 7,000 rubles, around $106, from his day job in Blagoveshchensk as a technician, Mr. Lunin gets by with support from his wife, who has a better-paying job at a medical institute. But even with their combined wages, they still have nowhere near enough cash to buy the equipment and materials needed to develop their land.

Unless he does something soon, the authorities can take back his property. To demonstrate that he is making some small progress, Mr. Lunin plans to build a small hut once the snow melts this year to shelter in and, he hopes, keep covetous officials away until he can save enough to start building something more permanent.

Describing himself as an optimist despite his dyspeptic view of Russia and its leaders, he said he learned long ago to never lose hope, or let officials get him down.

Raghda and Rafaa found new jobs, Raghda at Dasoqa, a coffee shop whose name means “ladybug,” and Rafaa at Blink, a community gathering space nearby.

Their parents have caved a little, but fretted a lot. They feared for the family’s reputation as much as for their daughters’ souls.

“Our dad says, ‘What if my family came and saw you here working, making coffee and drinks?’” said Raghda. “‘They’ll see your face!’”

To the sisters, that was the point. Raghda’s hair remains neatly tucked under a lilac head scarf, Rafaa’s under a black one. But their faces — sometimes people still do a double-take when they see them — are bare.

“My face is my identity,” said Rafaa.

It was not only their parents who objected. When they waited for Ubers after work, the young men hanging around the mall often heckled them, suspicious of their uncovered faces and light makeup.

“What are you doing with those guys?” they demanded as the sisters chatted with male friends.

The lack of reliable public polling and free speech makes it difficult to gauge how Saudis view women’s changing status. But one study, from 2018, suggested that fear of social stigma may drive opposition more than personal resistance.

In societies where the virus hits, it is deepening the consequences of inequality, pushing many of the burdens onto the losers of today’s polarized economies and labor markets. Research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease.

They are also likelier to die from it. And, even for those who remain healthy, they are likelier to suffer loss of income or health care as a result of quarantines and other measures, potentially on a sweeping scale.

Given the grim arithmetic of the pandemic, several of those negotiators are likely to fall ill.

“It would be better to agree a delay now,” Mr. Henig said. “If June is the peak of the virus and it is also the point where we are going to say, ‘no further extension,’ then that starts to look like a lack of forward planning.”

Analysts noted that coronavirus could give Mr. Johnson political cover to ask for an extension, if that was what he wanted to do anyway. Last fall, the prime minister cited a law passed by Parliament as giving him no choice but to ask for the withdrawal deadline to be moved from October to January.

For Mr. Johnson, however, such a move poses a dilemma. Under the terms of its agreement, Britain would be required to pay billions of pounds to the European Union if it continued to have access to the single market and customs union beyond the transition period that ends in December.

That would be an acute embarrassment for Mr. Johnson, damaging him particularly with the hard-line Brexit wing of his Conservative Party. Pro-Brexit forces have already begun campaigning against a delay — suggesting, in a strategy that echoes some defenders of President Trump in the United States, that these calls were part of an effort to exaggerate and politicize the virus for partisan ends.

It also brought front and center the European Union’s dependence on Turkey to limit the movement of migrants toward its territory, as well as Mr. Erdogan’s willingness to weaponize migrants for his own purposes.

But experts said Mr. Erdogan’s mobilization of migrants and security forces at the borders with Europe could have backfired, being so provocative that it may have made European politicians less willing to make concessions.

190,['Kevin Carey'],"Everybody Ready for the Big Migration to Online College? Actually, No","One way to manage the problem of inexperienced online professors is to increase the number of students being taught by the most successful teachers. Scale is currently a big part of online college, because that’s where all the profits are. It’s why for-profit colleges got into the online game early, and why public and private institutions are rapidly growing their offerings now.

But scale requires time and money upfront. The only way for one professor to reach hundreds or even thousands of students is to embed the learning process in technology. The simplest example is recording a lecture that students can view online. But effective online courses require much more. Many campuses now employ full-time “instructional designers” who help faculty map out courses and degree programs. They also create learning modules, online exercises, virtual laboratories and assessments.

The designers are good at their jobs and getting better. But it’s an expensive and labor-intensive process. The reason that many colleges are signing away up to 70 percent of future online tuition revenue to private for-profit companies is that those firms offer the financial capital and expertise needed to convert traditional courses online.

It’s impossible to transform a college course into the virtual world overnight. Which means the students currently boxing up their clothes and laptops also won’t benefit from the advantages of technology-enabled personalization. Fully online courses are usually, in whole or in part, “asynchronous,” meaning that students can learn when they need to.

A parent with a job can log on after putting the kids to bed at night, rather than hunt for a parking spot to make a 10 a.m. on-campus lecture. That’s a simple but powerful kind of personalization, particularly if people are caring for loved ones who are sick.

While the popular idea of individual “learning styles” has been largely discredited by academic research, people still bring vastly different levels of knowledge, talent and context to the classroom, virtual or otherwise. The long-sought-after dream of technology-enabled education is to build machines that can assess these differences, react to them, and give students a better educational experience — personalized to what they know and need.

There are decades of research in this field, and many promising theories and tools, but as of yet no breakthrough technologies in terms of cost and student learning.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/upshot/coronavirus-online-college-classes-unprepared.html,NY Times,Education,True

A public hospital nurse, for example, would likely not be able to stay home from work even if her child was home from school. And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

“The downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,” said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the Council’s health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving “reports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,” said Scarsdale’s school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday. “Preventative measures are only effective if we embrace and implement them as a community.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-schools.html,NY Times,Education,True
192,['Ginia Bellafante'],The Manhattan Private School That Tore Itself Apart,"Six days before Christmas, the headmaster of St. Bernard’s, the 116-year-old boys’ school on the Upper East Side, sent a letter to parents announcing that he would retire in the spring of 2021. For an institution profoundly rooted in its own traditions and protocols and rarely trafficking in the unexpected, the news had a jolting effect.

“After 40 years here,” he wrote, “I’d like to try something different. (Suggestions welcome.)”

It was those last two words that struck many parents — who at St. Bernard’s belong roughly to the demographic subsets of the have mores and the have everythings — as cryptic. Headmaster Stuart Johnson III was known as a man of purpose and passion, and if he were leaving on his own volition, the thinking went, he would have a plan — to study Virgil, to recreate Regency gardens.

Parents and alumni (who are in many cases the same people) quickly surmised that the decision to leave was not entirely the headmaster’s own, and this made them very angry. Mr. Johnson stood for something beyond the ruthless pursuit of scores, metrics and marketable achievements. He stood for the intrinsic value of erudition. What would happen if he was gone?

As the universe spun ever more furiously, St. Bernard’s under his guidance had kept to its own metabolism. While schools around the country were conforming to new ideologies and evolving ideas about class and gender, for example, St. Bernard’s remained steeped in mandatory Latin and French, blue blazers and penmanship — not Mandarin and coding and self-reflection. This was the territory it had staked among the incubators of the meritocracy, the many schools in which a child could be educated in New York for the approximate sum of $50,000 a year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/st-bernards-school-stuart-johnson.html,NY Times,Education,True
193,['Claire Cain Miller'],Public School Is a Child’s Right. Should Preschool Be Also?,"But researchers and proponents say that thinking about early childhood programs like public school is a useful frame. As schools close because of the coronavirus outbreak, parents are coming to terms with how much they rely on them as a safe place for children to go. The idea treats preschool as an investment that benefits society at large, as primary and secondary education do. Universal programs tend to have broader political support than those that are means-tested — targeted at people below a certain income. And they are simpler to run because people don’t have to submit paperwork to prove they qualify.

For early learning in particular, researchers say, universal options have educational benefits that means-tested programs like Head Start do not. Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.

On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”

A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.

“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.

Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool. Those who don’t are more likely to be Hispanic, from low-income families or with parents who did not go to college.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/upshot/universal-child-care-democratic-platform.html,NY Times,Education,True

The Education Department released school districts from a slew of testing and accountability measures required by federal law.

But schools across the country were far ahead of the Trump administration’s advice. A cascade of public school closings gained speed nationwide on Friday, with the largest school district in California, the Los Angeles Unified School District, announcing it was closing, along with the San Diego Unified School District.

A majority of closings announced by school districts range from two to six weeks, which the C.D.C. considered “short- to medium-term closures” that would “not impact” the huge wave of infections that are expected in the next few weeks.

“Symbols of Hate” at the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust had an unexpected beginning.

199,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],"Veterans Are Working, but Not in Jobs That Match Their Advanced Training","Veterans, particularly those without college degrees, are often pushed toward low-skill jobs even though their training and the culture of the military might well translate into other types of positions. A clear pipeline to those jobs, however, does not exist for veterans.

“The employers are saying ‘It’s not our job to train them,’” said Joan Lynch, the chief content and programming officer at WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign that focuses on labor in the United States. “So whose job is it to train veterans for the work force? The military? No; they teach them to defend our nation. Employers aren’t doing it, either.”

Many jobs require licenses and training for skills that veterans learned in combat, particularly in health care. Many veterans who acquired deep knowledge and specialized emergency response techniques, for example, would have no immediate access to the long credentialing process to become a physician assistant.

Ms. Lynch said she had encountered many returning medics who were unable to immediately translate their skills into jobs — even when they had privately tutored medical residents on skills like suturing — because they lacked a license. At the same time, those extensive experiences may not apply in other, often lower-wage jobs for which they are vastly overqualified.

“These people have about $1 million of training that the government has put into them,” Ms. Lynch said. “But they don’t have one credit toward a professional degree, and they end up being turned down for jobs delivering dry cleaning. It breaks your heart.”

Under the most recent Defense Department budget bill, Congress authorized the military to conduct a pilot program to assess a possible partnership among Special Operations forces, colleges and health care systems in which veterans can earn credit toward a master’s degree in physician assistant studies for their military operational work and medic training.

200,['Marc Lacey'],How Poetry Shakes Up the National Desk’s Morning Meetings,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.

When the National desk gets together to discuss stories, it can be a grim half-hour. We dissect natural disasters. We reconstruct mass shootings. We delve into political scandals and all manner of domestic tumult. Recently, though, we added a new feature to our morning meetings aimed at inspiring us and boosting our creativity before we embark on another long day of editing the news.

We read a poem.

I got the idea from an unlikely source: my son’s high school English teacher, Anne Baney. During parent-teacher night, she explained how she reads a poem at the beginning of every class from “Poetry 180,” an anthology of contemporary poems compiled by Billy Collins, the former poet laureate of the United States. The room turns quiet when she reads, she told us. If she ever forgets to start off the day with a poem, her students remind her. They like it.

And, it turns out, so do we.

While there was some initial eye rolling when I first suggested the idea, Morrigan McCarthy, a photo editor and former poetry major, got it. She started us off with a poem called “The Book of Hand Shadows,” by Marianne Boruch. It began like this:

An eagle and a squirrel. A bull and a sage.

All take two hands, even the sheep

whose mouth is a lever for nothing, neither

grass nor complaint. The black swan’s

mostly one long arm, bent

at the elbow but there’s always feathers

to fool with.

“The magic of poetry,” Morrigan remarked, “is that it jolts your mind into thinking about a subject or theme in an unexpected way. That’s exactly what we want to be doing on the National desk: looking every day for smart and interesting ways to tackle the most important stories in this country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/reader-center/poetry-national-news.html,NY Times,Education,True
201,['Kevin Carey'],The Bleak Job Landscape of Adjunctopia for Ph.D.s,"Yet at no point did universities seem to consider slowing the flow of students into the Ph.D. pipeline. The opposite happened. In 1988, the number of doctorates in the humanities conferred was estimated to be 3,570, and it increased to 5,145 in 2018.

Tenured professors like having graduate students around. They teach the boring undergraduate sections for little or no pay and provide inexpensive research assistance. For many veteran scholars, training the next generation is one of the most rewarding parts of the job.

There was another complication. In 1994, a new federal law outlawed the widespread practice of requiring professors to retire at age 70. The effects of this accumulated as the baby boom generation aged. The oldest tenured boomers turned 70 in 2016, just in time to not retire and not create room for millennials hitting the job market with newly minted Ph.D.s.

Consumer preferences also shifted. Stung by ever-rising tuition costs and anxious about a treacherous job market, many students left the humanities for more job-focused majors after the Great Recession.

All of this resulted in a severe misalignment of supply and demand. Universities had spent the better part of two decades training more people for jobs that universities simultaneously decided they didn’t need, just as economic, demographic and legal conditions began further depressing the need for professors. It’s no wonder that many humanities majors are using their considerable creative and rhetorical skills to liken their job searches to various post-apocalyptic imaginings.

As competition for tenure-track jobs becomes more fierce, only the graduates of top-ranked programs have a realistic chance, and even they increasingly settle for positions at less prestigious institutions that emphasize teaching and service over research. For example, the University of Michigan’s English department is ranked in the top 12 by U.S. News & World Report. Of the approximately 50 scholars who have graduated from the department and won tenure-track positions since 2008, only one is employed at a top 12 department, and that is Michigan itself.

Senator Sanders’s proposed legislation would be a highly unusual federal intrusion in the way universities conduct their academic business, and would probably be attacked by the higher education lobby.

More than 800 schools stand to lose thousands of dollars from the Rural and Low-Income School Program because the department has abruptly changed how districts are to report how many of their students live in poverty. The change, quietly announced in letters to state education leaders, comes after the Education Department said a review of the program revealed that districts had “erroneously” received funding because they had not met eligibility requirements outlined in the federal education law since 2002.

The department said it was simply following the law, which requires that in order to get funding, districts must use data from the Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates to determine whether 20 percent of their area’s school-age children live below the poverty line.

If convicted, he could face up to 53 years in prison. He has denied wrongdoing.

Kenneth L. Marcus, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights, said the investigation was one of the largest that the office had ever conducted.

Mr. Biden has unfurled a plan of his own, as well as a “Public Health Advisory Committee” featuring prominent health care leaders, seeking at every turn to “offer a view into how Biden will lead in times of crisis as president,” as one Biden official described a Thursday speech Mr. Biden delivered on the matter. His allies argue that in times of crisis — whether it’s the coronavirus outbreak or, earlier this year, tensions with Iran — Mr. Biden is seen by voters as a steady, experienced hand.

Sunday’s broadcast is thought to be the first presidential debate to be held in a closed television studio since the Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960, according to Mr. Feist. Those encounters, the first televised debates of the mass media age, took place at television stations in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington.

With only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders onstage, it will also be the smallest Democratic debate of the campaign; several earlier debates featured as many as 20 candidates and had to be spread over two nights. Timing rules will be similar to past debates, with 75 seconds allotted for each candidate’s response, though fewer zingers and zippy sound-bites are expected.

“Debates with two candidates tend to be more of a conversation than other debates because time is less of a factor,” Mr. Feist said. “While those are the rules, the reality of a debate with two candidates is that it’s likely to be more conversational.”

Sunday’s debate was originally planned for an Arizona theater with a large audience. CNN, Democratic officials and the campaigns agreed to move the location to Washington, reducing the need for hundreds of political aides, journalists and TV crew members to take cross-country flights.

The CNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, along with the Univision anchor Ilia Calderón, will serve as moderators. Another moderator, Jorge Ramos of Univision, relinquished his spot as a precaution after he believed he had been possibly exposed to the coronavirus; Mr. Ramos has no symptoms and has said he feels healthy.

The absence of a live audience will add an additional wrinkle for two candidates accustomed to the reactions of a crowd.

When it comes to preventing such disruptions, Mr. Bernanke said, “that is something, in the first line of defense, that Congress can do.”

The Fed did some lending aimed at nonfinancial companies — including through its commercial paper funding facility and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which helped meet household and small business credit needs — and authority for those programs still exists. For corporate bailouts, Mr. Bernanke said, lawmakers should be the first line of defense.

“It’s more democratic and accountable if Congress were to take the lead,” he said.

Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was President George W. Bush’s Treasury secretary in 2008, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week that one of the lessons from that crisis was that the executive branch might need more authority from Congress to take quick action.

“Notwithstanding tensions between the parties and between the branches, it may be necessary to give the administration broad authority and flexibility to act, within the parameters and oversight structure set by the legislature,” Mr. Paulson wrote. “Congress can’t design and implement every stimulus program or turn on a dime to give new authorities to the executive when facts on the ground change.”

Hal Scott, an emeritus professor at Harvard Law School and the director of the nonprofit Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, said the Fed must restore its ability to be the world’s most powerful lender of last resort. It was unfortunate that such authorities needed to be reinstated amid a crisis, he said.

The premier in-person event in democracy, historically — voting itself — has also been scrambled. Two states, Louisiana and Georgia, are postponing their primaries amid virus concerns. Others, including Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona, plan to go forward with their elections this week.

But for the candidates competing in those contests, confinement to a campaign live-stream is a significant impediment.

The past four presidents, for their many differences, all distinguished themselves with an ability to excel in a room, either through soaring speechmaking (Barack Obama), rampaging rally (Mr. Trump) or a talent for insta-connections with voters in smaller, unrehearsed settings (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush).

Certainly all three major 2020 candidates are being stripped of some signal political strengths during the hiatus. Mr. Trump’s events are something akin to oxygen for him, rousing his base and supplying the live-action feedback and adulation he craves.

Mr. Biden’s best moments often come on the voter rope-line after he leaves the lectern, showcasing his empathy and charm — and his eagerness to shake hands, shoulders, anything in range — more effectively than his public remarks tend to. (Other flourishes, like his recent profanity-specked exchange with a man in Michigan, who suggested Mr. Biden wanted to confiscate guns, can also flow from these interactions, for better or worse.)

It would be the biggest test the sprawling and sometimes troubled government hospital system has faced.

The department is experienced in managing an older and vulnerable population, and in many ways, it could be better prepared than the rest of the health care system to take on the task. It has a surplus of beds in many of its 172 hospital centers and a robust number of special rooms for patients with breathing disorders. Leaders at the agency say they have a surplus of supplies that they have been ordering since the beginning of the year.

“Nobody has asked for our help at this point, but the American people should know we are ready,” said Dr. Richard A. Stone, who is in charge of the Veterans Health Administration.

This is why it costs around $1,000 to rent a U-Haul truck heading from Orange County, Calif., to Phoenix, but only $100 to rent one to go the other way, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

On the surface, adding new people and new subdivisions is the same thing the Arizona economy was doing as the real estate bubble inflated. But the nature of Arizona’s growth — and the kinds of workers it has attracted — has changed.

In the previous cycle, the economy consisted of “building homes for people who build homes,” said Scott Smith, a former homebuilder who served as the mayor of Mesa and is now chief executive of Valley Metro, the Phoenix region’s public transportation authority. The recent expansion, on the other hand, is marked by the growth of finance and technology companies that employ people like Mr. Jordan.

The number of finance jobs in the Phoenix area is up 25 percent since its pre-recession peak in early 2007, compared with 5 percent nationally, with companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan opening or expanding local offices, according to Moody’s Analytics. Technology companies have expanded their head count by about 30 percent in that time, while construction employment is still 24 percent lower than its peak before the recession.

“Our economy has been diversified like I have never seen in my three decades in business,” said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage firm in Scottsdale.

If construction and subprime loans were symbolic of the state’s last boom, this time the image would be offices like WebPT, which makes software used by physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists to manage billing and medical information.

216,['Claire Cain Miller'],Public School Is a Child’s Right. Should Preschool Be Also?,"But researchers and proponents say that thinking about early childhood programs like public school is a useful frame. As schools close because of the coronavirus outbreak, parents are coming to terms with how much they rely on them as a safe place for children to go. The idea treats preschool as an investment that benefits society at large, as primary and secondary education do. Universal programs tend to have broader political support than those that are means-tested — targeted at people below a certain income. And they are simpler to run because people don’t have to submit paperwork to prove they qualify.

For early learning in particular, researchers say, universal options have educational benefits that means-tested programs like Head Start do not. Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.

On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”

A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.

“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.

Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool. Those who don’t are more likely to be Hispanic, from low-income families or with parents who did not go to college.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/upshot/universal-child-care-democratic-platform.html,NY Times,Politics,True

Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.

“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.

The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”

Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005.)

But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.

In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joseph-biden-bernie-sanders.html,NY Times,Politics,True

Vice President Mike Pence, a senior administration official said, learned only on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had been tested. At the news conference, Mr. Pence was left to handle questions about the president’s decision, some of which he did not appear to know how to answer.

Mr. Pence also indicated that he might soon follow the president’s lead. “I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician’s office,” he told reporters. The physician, he said, had previously advised him that he did not need testing.

Mr. Trump, who sees strength as the most important quality someone can project, has often equated illness with weakness. Over the past week, he had resisted testing, disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has recommended tests and self-quarantine for anyone who has stood next to someone who had tested positive.

Despite having the imprimatur of the highest level of American government, Dr. Conley’s decision not to recommend a test for Mr. Trump, or any sort of isolation, was at odds with the advice of other physicians, as well as medical experts on the administration’s own coronavirus task force.

The standard protocol is to ask people exposed to a known coronavirus case to stay home, to monitor their own health and to refrain from their regular activities for 14 days, and to get tested if they develop symptoms, said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

As a head of state leading the nation through a turbulent time, the president has a singular responsibility to safeguard his health, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. By letting a week go by before agreeing to a test, Mr. Gostin said, Mr. Trump “gives exactly the wrong message to the public, and puts himself and his cabinet at risk.”

But that decision was in line with the course of action Mr. Trump preferred — avoiding a test whose results could make him face a reality he might not want to acknowledge. It also followed a pattern of Mr. Trump’s career in politics: releasing memos and statements from medical professionals who are willing to say whatever he wants them to say about his health. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, Mr. Trump’s personal physician during the 2016 presidential campaign, later admitted that a flattering doctor’s letter he had released was dictated to him verbatim by Mr. Trump.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-virus-test.html,NY Times,Politics,True

Ms. Green is confident in the C.D.C., in large part because she believes Mr. Trump is, too. Later in the week, after the president declared a national emergency over the pandemic, her confidence that Mr. Trump was leaning on experts to do what was best for Americans had only soared.

“I’m actually even more impressed after today’s press briefing,” she said on Friday, after the president spoke in the Rose Garden, with top health officials and C.E.O.s. “I voted for Trump because he’s a problem solver.

Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50 employees, if it determines that providing paid leave “would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.”

Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus. Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)

The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some public health experts have called for — effectively paying any worker to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.

It also excludes “certain health care providers and emergency responders” from the benefit.

Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave. The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the outbreak.

223,['John Schwartz'],"Social Distancing? You Might Be Fighting Climate Change, Too","Here are four areas we may see changes in greenhouse gas emissions because of the coronavirus.

Image

Transportation: Big Reductions

People are staying home and flying less. That’s good for the planet, Dr. Nicholas said. “For average Americans, the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions is driving,” she said. Anything that reduces driving, including working from home, “has a big impact on our climate pollution.” Avoiding air travel can have a large effect as well: one round-trip flight from New York to London, she said, produces as much greenhouse gas emissions as the preventive climate impact of nearly eight years of recycling. Dr. Nicholas was an author of a 2018 study that examines greenhouse gas emissions reductions in actions people take to fight climate change, and is currently writing a book about personal action and the climate crisis.

The actual effects on your greenhouse gas emissions of staying home will greatly depend on where you live, Dr. Jones said. For the roughly 25 percent of Americans living in the suburbs and another 25 percent in rural areas, cutting out a commute often means driving far less. But about 50 percent of Americans live in urban areas, and for those who use mass transit, avoiding a commute doesn’t necessarily cause much of a dip in emissions. The University of California, Berkeley, has suspended in-person instruction, and Dr. Jones said, “I commute by train and the train is going with or without me and everyone else, so I don’t think there’s an impact there.”

Food: A Big Maybe

Dr. Jones has done research into the relative carbon footprints of dining at home or dining out, but, so far, the results are fuzzy. “We don’t have conclusive evidence yet,” he said, citing the comparative efficiency benefits of eating out and the waste involved in making meals at home. “We waste about 25 percent of the food that we buy,” he said. If you drive long distances to go to a favorite place — like Austinites who drive more than 30 miles to Lockhart, Tex., for excellent barbecue, “that’s going to swamp the emissions from your food.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/climate/coronavirus-habits-carbon-footprint.html,NY Times,Climate,True

The Corps defended its policy. Without using eminent domain, officials said, the Corps can’t guarantee to Congress that the buyouts lawmakers have funded will actually happen.

And that would leave residents still at risk. Imagine the Corps identifies 10 homes for buyouts, but only three people say yes, said Susan Layton, chief of planning and policy for the Corps’ Norfolk District office, which is working on buyout plans in Florida. With a voluntary program, that leaves seven homes still exposed. “You’re probably not doing your best job,” she said.

The Corps applies a relatively simple formula to decide which houses should be condemned, officials said: It estimates how much damage a house is likely to suffer in the next 50 years, then compares that to what it would cost to buy and tear down the house, plus moving expenses for the owner. If the buyout costs less, the homeowner is asked to sell for the assessed value of the home. That price is not negotiable, and neither is the offer.

Many officials have balked, at least for now. Miami-Dade has yet to agree to evict residents, and New Jersey has refused. In the Florida Keys, Roman Gastesi, the county administrator, said he doubted the county commission would approve it.

The bloc announced an ambitious plan on Wednesday that would require manufacturers of electronic products, from smartphones to tumble driers, to offer more repairs, upgrades and ways to reuse existing goods, instead of encouraging consumers to buy new ones.

The “right to repair,” part of a wide-ranging policy package known as the Green Deal that was introduced this month, is the latest example of the European Union’s ambitions to promote more sustainable economic growth and to prevent waste. It extends standards brought in last year that put “right to repair” obligations on the manufacturers of some large appliances.

Such are the logistical complexities of the expedition, known as Mosaic, in which a German research ship, Polarstern, has been drifting with the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean since October with a revolving complement of scientists. The ship is expected to come out of the ice east of Greenland in September after gathering a year’s worth of data on conditions in the remote Central Arctic.

The Kapitan Dranitsyn left Tromso, Norway, on Jan. 29 with 43 tons of food, fuel and other supplies for the Polarstern, as well as a replacement team of researchers and technicians for what is the third two-month leg of the expedition. The resupply trip was expected to take about two weeks, but the icebreaker ran into trouble from the start, when a storm in the Barents Sea forced it to anchor off Tromso for the better part of a week.

Once underway, the ship encountered sea ice that had gotten much thicker as the winter progressed — doubling to more than 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, in places. The Kapitan Dranitsyn finally arrived at the Polarstern on Feb. 28.

After several days unloading the supplies and transferring personnel across about a half-mile of ice in dangerous conditions (a wind chill of minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or about minus 58 Celsius), the Kapitan Dranitsyn left for the return trip to Tromso. But calculations showed that it would not have enough diesel fuel for the journey.

So on March 3, another icebreaker, the Admiral Makarov, left Murmansk, Russia, with a load of extra fuel to intercept the Kapitan Dranitsyn on its way. Early this week, the two ships were about 350 miles, or roughly 560 kilometers, apart.

The town was notorious for its aversion to strangers — residents have long been in the habit of removing state signage — and for having curtailed development by limiting water permits. “We were a close network of people who got together around the whole land use question,” Mr. Schell said of the community. “Of the idea that you don’t have to be consuming on a massive scale to be an American.

“The first thing that tourists do when they arrive in Paris is to order a drink on a terrace,” he said.

But Mr. Fargue never had a chance to experience terrace heaters.

Their prevalence dates back to 2008, when a ban on smoking in enclosed public places spurred restaurants and cafes to install heat lamps on their terraces to provide smokers with some comfort.

In a city that last year experienced record-breaking temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, however, the terrace culture seems at odds with increasing concerns about climate change. Nor is the ban the only pro-environment move being considered.

Even though, in the short term, airlines have seen a sharp decline in air travel, and therefore emissions, demand is widely expected to bounce back eventually as the world resumes its embrace of flying. But in the meantime, the airline industry, an increasingly important contributor of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is citing the financial pain caused by the heath scare as reason to weaken longer-term efforts to fight global warming.

At least one major carrier, Air France-KLM, has cited the virus in calling for European countries to delay upcoming policies designed to curb air travel and reduce emissions. “In view of the coronavirus outbreak, we are asking governments to suspend the introduction of new flight taxes,” Benjamin Smith, the airline’s chief executive, said at the Airlines4Europe conference in Brussels on Tuesday.

Who knew you could take it, freeze it, and it becomes a totally different delicacy? When I first tried it, I immediately thought, “I have to write about this someday.”

Was there anything from your reporting you wanted to include but couldn’t find room for?

In the dispatch I mention that people in that region are frustrated by pollution caused by the oil and gas industry that’s becoming more active in the Russian Arctic. On the other side you have the fact that this oil and gas exploration brings untold sums of money to these regions. That was striking, seeing how high the quality of life was in these towns. That economic aspect is something we typically put in the forefront of stories, but I wanted to put the cultural and personal stories in the forefront here.

We write about Putin, politics, and will continue to, but we also want to tell stories of people. The food people eat is a core component of the human existence.

Does climate change have greater implications for stroganina?

That’s another theory I had when reporting this that I didn’t end up including. The colder it is, the faster the fish or meat freezes and the better the flavor. At the end of the day, people notice climate change, but no one said it affected stroganina. But there is the thawing of the permafrost that endangers the infrastructure.

He hadn’t really considered whether it was a waste of jet fuel. “Yeah, that’s a great point,” he said.

The push followed a spate of lobbying and campaign contributions by people in the nursing-home industry, according to public records and interviews.

The coronavirus has killed 13 residents at a nursing home in Washington State; dozens more residents and employees there have fallen ill. Seeking to prevent further contagion, some states, including New York, have banned most nonmedical personnel from setting foot inside nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which nationally have about 2.5 million residents.

Last July, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., set in motion a plan to weaken rules imposed by the Obama administration that required every nursing home to employ at least one specialist in preventing infections. The proposed rules — which the agency is completing and has the power to enact — eliminate the requirement to have even a part-time infection specialist on staff. Instead, the Trump administration would require that anti-infection specialists spend “sufficient time at the facility.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/business/trump-administration-nursing-homes.html,NY Times,Business,True

This is why it costs around $1,000 to rent a U-Haul truck heading from Orange County, Calif., to Phoenix, but only $100 to rent one to go the other way, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

On the surface, adding new people and new subdivisions is the same thing the Arizona economy was doing as the real estate bubble inflated. But the nature of Arizona’s growth — and the kinds of workers it has attracted — has changed.

In the previous cycle, the economy consisted of “building homes for people who build homes,” said Scott Smith, a former homebuilder who served as the mayor of Mesa and is now chief executive of Valley Metro, the Phoenix region’s public transportation authority. The recent expansion, on the other hand, is marked by the growth of finance and technology companies that employ people like Mr. Jordan.

The number of finance jobs in the Phoenix area is up 25 percent since its pre-recession peak in early 2007, compared with 5 percent nationally, with companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan opening or expanding local offices, according to Moody’s Analytics. Technology companies have expanded their head count by about 30 percent in that time, while construction employment is still 24 percent lower than its peak before the recession.

“Our economy has been diversified like I have never seen in my three decades in business,” said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage firm in Scottsdale.

If construction and subprime loans were symbolic of the state’s last boom, this time the image would be offices like WebPT, which makes software used by physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists to manage billing and medical information. Over the past decade the company has grown from a handful of people working out of subleased office space in coffee shops and architectural firms to a 500-person operation with headquarters in a downtown Phoenix industrial space that used to be a tortilla factory.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/arizona-economy-primary.html,NY Times,Business,True

Aramco’s future results will probably continue to be heavily influenced by the policies of Saudi Arabia, its main owner. Having failed to agree with Russia on new production trims at a meeting on March 6 in Vienna, the Saudi government ordered Aramco to ramp up its sales and production. The company recently slashed the prices it was offering to customers for its crude in April.

Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, hopes to offset the drop in prices with a rise in exports. Low oil prices and the deteriorating global economy threaten to undermine the prince’s ambitious plan, known as Vision 2030, to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil.

Aramco said in its release that in response to price volatility it would most likely cut capital spending to between $25 billion and $30 billion for 2020 compared to $32.8 billion in 2019. At the same time, the company recently announced plans to increase production capacity by a million barrels a day to 13 million barrels a day as part of the saber-rattling with Russia. A production increase of that magnitude will most likely require large expenditures on drilling and other operations.

Aramco said the earnings decrease was primarily because of lower oil prices. It also produced less oil because of restrictions that were in effect with OPEC and Russia. The company said it had earned lower levels of profits in refining crude and making chemicals, and had taken a $1.6 billion write-down on Sadara Chemical, a $20 billion joint venture with Dow Chemical.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/saudi-aramco-profit.html,NY Times,Business,True

The more images of stockpiling that emerged on social media, the more panicky buying that ensued.

Seemingly every aspect of American life has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, and the weekend ritual of watching a movie in the dark with strangers has been no exception. Most cinemas in the United States remain open, with the two biggest chains, AMC and Regal, reducing seating capacity in auditoriums by 50 percent so that people could leave at least one empty seat between them. But fears about the coronavirus kept the masses at home: Domestic ticket sales totaled about $55.3 million, a 44 percent drop from last weekend, despite three new films — “Bloodshot,” “The Hunt” and “I Still Believe” — arriving in wide release.

It was the worst period for movie theaters in two decades, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. The next lowest weekend was Sept. 15 to 17 in 2000, when ticket sales totaled $54.5 million and the primary draws were holdovers like “The Watcher,” a serial-killer movie, and “Nurse Betty,” a dark comedy starring Renée Zellweger. In today’s money, however, the 2000 weekend generated roughly $83 million in ticket sales.

But even as farmers and slaughterhouses ramp up, producing food takes time. In the poultry industry, it takes 10 days for a chicken egg to incubate and hatch, and then five to six weeks for the bird to grow to maturity. For some chicken suppliers, the process takes even longer, depending on the type of bird.

Across the industry, “you’re talking about 50 days to get to a customer,” said Matthew Wadiak, who runs Cooks Venture, a chicken supplier based in Arkansas and Oklahoma. “Fifty days ago, we didn’t know this was even on the horizon. There was essentially no way to plan for it.”

Mr. Wadiak said some of Cooks Venture’s customers — like the Berkeley Bowl grocery stores in California — had quadrupled their orders in recent days.

When it comes to preventing such disruptions, Mr. Bernanke said, “that is something, in the first line of defense, that Congress can do.”

The Fed did some lending aimed at nonfinancial companies — including through its commercial paper funding facility and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which helped meet household and small-business credit needs — and authority for those programs still exists. For corporate bailouts, Mr. Bernanke said, lawmakers should be the first line of defense.

“It’s more democratic and accountable if Congress were to take the lead,” he said.

Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was President George W. Bush’s Treasury secretary in 2008, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week that one of the lessons from that crisis was that the executive branch might need more authority from Congress to take quick action.

“Notwithstanding tensions between the parties and between the branches, it may be necessary to give the administration broad authority and flexibility to act, within the parameters and oversight structure set by the legislature,” Mr. Paulson wrote. “Congress can’t design and implement every stimulus program or turn on a dime to give new authorities to the executive when facts on the ground change.”

(The stock market rallied in response to some definitive news, for a change.) House Democrats also struck a deal with the White House on a sweeping relief bill later that night. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the package included paid sick leave guarantees and additional food aid and federal funds for Medicaid. The Senate is expected to act on the legislation next week.

Approaching Zero

The Fed is expected to lower interest rates again this week, hot on the heels of its emergency rate cut earlier this month. It’s yet another step in the scramble to reassure investors, consumers and workers, who are uneasy about how the pandemic will affect them and how much worse it will get.

Consumer education is a necessity for the alternative and premium milk sector: Americans are drinking less dairy milk, but it’s still the product they’re most familiar with. For A2, a New Zealand-based dairy company that sells milk that’s free of the A1 protein that many people find difficult to digest, health benefits are a way into the fast-growing but hypercompetitive alternative-dairy market.

Milk, said Blake Waltrip, the chief executive of A2, is a “repertoire purchasing category”: The average consumer has three to four different types of milk or milk alternatives in their rotation. As far as they’re concerned, it’s all just milk. Which means that these companies need to constantly be innovating to recapture consumers’ interests.

For A2, health benefits are an easy sell. “People care more about what the product does for them than about getting deep into the science,” said Mr. Waltrip. In Australia, A2 accounts for 11 percent of all milk sales, and the company claims that 70 percent of their consumers have no milk intolerance at all. Mr. Waltrip believes it’s because theirs is a “better milk,” but it also may be that consumers, long confused about whether or not dairy milk is good for them, are relieved to have a “healthy” dairy milk to buy.

Finding new ways to market and process milk has become essential for dairy farmers looking to turn things around. But some are thinking of making bigger changes to their production.

How, then, did Saturn end up with massive Titan and a multitude of tinier moons?

That is extreme, but it may not be the worst scenario. Ophiuchus is relatively close to Earth, only about 390 million light-years away. If astronomers look farther afield, they might see evidence of equally outlandish events, said Norbert Werner, an astronomer at Masaryk University in Brno in the Czech Republic and at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, whose observations with NASA’s orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory helped lead to the discovery.

A black hole with several billion times the mass of the sun presumably squats at the center of the Ophiuchus cluster, in a galaxy known only by a number, WISEA J171227.81-232210.7.

Black holes are best known for their ability to swallow matter and energy, including light, and remove it from the universe forever.

Paradoxically, belching black holes are the brightest objects in the universe, producing the fireworks known as quasars and other violent phenomena.

Galaxy clusters are the largest conglomerations of matter in the universe, containing the equivalent of trillions of suns. But most of that matter is in the form of intergalactic gas so hot that it radiates X-rays, which astronomers use to spot clusters far out in space.

That means that when the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve, Earth hasn’t quite circled all the way back to its starting point.

If a year is divisible by 100, for example, there’s no extra day — unless the year is divisible by 400.

This celestial event is known as a Moon-Mars occultation, and it occurs from some vantage point on Earth about twice a year, according to NASA. Skywatchers from much of North and Central America will have a front-row seat to Tuesday’s occultation, and those along part of the West Coast will have an especially good view, with a chance to watch the entire show before sunrise.

This pre-dawn meetup is a useful preview of how Mars will be central to space exploration this year.

Three robotic rover missions are expected to launch to the red planet this summer — one built by NASA, a second by China and a third produced by a European-Russian collaboration. The United Arab Emirates will also launch a Mars mission, an uncrewed orbiter called Hope.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/science/moon-occults-mars.html,NY Times,Space,True
293,,Coronavirus: Isolation for over-70s 'within weeks',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort""

Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus.

When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

The government is to release social distancing advice for the elderly on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods.

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35.

Mr Hancock told the BBC manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS, and hotels could be turned into hospitals, Mr Hancock said.

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care.

Earlier, 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Image copyright Nick Matthews Facebook Image caption Mary Matthews paid tribute to her husband, Nick, on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""best friend""

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"", following Mr Matthews' death at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

She said she and her family were ""currently in isolation"" until they received their coronavirus test results back and urged people not to visit them until they got the all-clear.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had recently returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, flying out on February 22 and returning on February 29.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are not being tested, with the government prioritising tests for those ""most at risk of severe illness"".

Tests will primarily be given:

To all patients in critical care for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

To all other patients requiring hospital admission for pneumonia, ARDS or flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

Earlier, Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would be told within weeks they needed to remain at home, with groceries and vital medication delivered - but he did not give details about how long this would be for or when it would start.

Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends so long as they stayed two metres - or six feet - apart from them.

All the UK deaths from the virus so far have been among people aged over 60 or with underlying health conditions.

The Scottish government set out its interpretation of the strategy, saying it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.

""What we're saying to them is, reduce your contact.""

The Scottish government has also published its guidance that gatherings of 500 people or more should not take place in Scotland.

Although it does not have the power to call off events, it has urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" in cancelling large gatherings from Monday to help the efforts of emergency services.

'Start making more ventilators'

Manufacturers including car makers, weapon makers and army suppliers are to be asked to switch their production lines to making ventilators for use in hospitals treating coronavirus - which can cause severe breathing problems.

Digger manufacturer JCB said it has been approached by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to see if it could help with the production of ventilators.

The company chairman, Lord Bamford, said it was ""unclear as yet"" whether it could assist, but its research and engineering teams were ""actively looking"" at the request.

The health service is to stop non-urgent surgery and implement a huge training programme to retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those who become seriously ill with the Covid-19 disease.

What is a ventilator?

A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide

Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery

A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy)

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment, but that many times that number would be needed.

Work is also under way to buy up thousands of private hospital beds to boost NHS capacity should it be needed and the possibility that empty hotels may be requisitioned has not been ruled out.

Mr Hancock earlier used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to liken the coronavirus crisis to World War Two.

He wrote that, despite the Blitz, the UK ""pulled together in one gigantic national effort"" and that the same must happen once more.

It came as the government's strategy was criticised by some scientists, who wrote to ministers urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

""Of course there is a scientific debate around scientific concepts but I want to be absolutely crystal clear, we will do what is necessary,"" Mr Hancock said.

An emergency bill giving the government temporary powers to tackle the outbreak will be published next week.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the government is ""well behind the curve"" in its management of the outbreak and urged No 10 to give ""clearer guidance"" and ""much better support"".

He insisted the government had not acted ""fast enough"" to tackle the virus, citing concerns over the availability of NHS beds, ventilators and staff.

He said he had written to Mr Johnson demanding a meeting and to ask what would be in the emergency legislation that is to be presented to Parliament next week.

Why and when should vulnerable self-isolate?

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks or so.

That's why it's essential people don't go too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self isolating.

But the officials recognise that individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

294,"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus: Some scientists say UK virus strategy is 'risking lives',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's nuanced approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

In an open letter, the 229 specialists in disciplines ranging from mathematics to genetics - though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases - say the UK's current approach will put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"".

The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune.

The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

The scientists - all from UK universities - also questioned the government's view that people would become fed up with restrictions if they were imposed too soon.

Their letter was published on the day it was announced 10 more people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21.

Meanwhile the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advised that measures to protect vulnerable people - including household isolation - ""will need to be instituted soon"".

Sir Patrick and the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, have said they intend to publish the computer models on which their strategy is based.

The UK's approach to coping with the coronavirus pandemic has been in stark contrast to other countries. The whole of Italy has been on lockdown since Tuesday, while Poland is set to close its borders for two weeks.

On Saturday the French government ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday).

And Spain has declared a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle the virus,

Measures 'insufficient'

In the open letter the group of scientists argue that stronger ""social distancing measures"" would ""dramatically"" slow the rate of growth of the disease in the UK, and would spare ""thousands of lives"".

The group, specialising in a range of disciplines, ranging from mathematics to genetics, though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases, said the current measures are ""insufficient"" and ""additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately"", as is happening in other countries.

On Friday, Sir Patrick suggested managing the spread of the disease so that the population gains some immunity to the disease was a part of the government strategy.

This idea, known as ""herd immunity"", means at-risk individuals are protected from infection because they are surrounded by people who are resistant to the disease.

Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease.

But in the open letter, the scientists said: ""Going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option.""

'Laissez-faire attitude'

The major downside of herd immunity, according to Birmingham University's Prof Willem van Schaik, is that this will mean that in the UK alone at least 36 million people will need to be infected and recover.

""It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths,"" he said.

""The only way to make this work would be to spread out these millions of cases over a relatively long period of time so that the NHS does not get overwhelmed.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Willem Von Schaik, professor of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, was one of the signatories

Prof van Schaik noted that the UK is the only country in Europe that is following what he described as its ""laissez-faire attitude to the virus"".

But a Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said that Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic. Our aims are to save lives, protect the most vulnerable, and relieve pressure on our NHS,"" he said.

""We have now moved out of the contain phase and into delay, and we have experts working round the clock. Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence.

""Our awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible.""

In a separate letter to the government, more than 200 behavioural scientists have questioned the government's argument that starting tougher measures too soon would lead to people not sticking to them just at the point that the epidemic is at its height.

""While we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about 'behavioural fatigue' or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,"" the letter said.

""Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it.""

""In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. Carrying on as normal for as long as possible undercuts that urgency,"" it added.

The scientists said ""radical behaviour change"" could have a ""much better"" effect and could ""save very large numbers of lives"".

""Experience in China and South Korea is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that this possibility should at least be attempted,"" it added.

The second letter called on the government to reconsider its stance on ""behavioural fatigue"" and to share the evidence on which it based this stance.

295,,PrEP: Preventative HIV drug available in England from April,"Image copyright Getty Images

A drug that prevents the transmission of the HIV virus will be available in England from April, the Department of Health has confirmed.

PrEP - or pre-exposure prophylaxis - is an antiretroviral medicine which, taken once a day, stops the transmission of HIV during unprotected sex.

The pill is already available in Scotland and Wales to people at risk of contracting the virus.

It is estimated there are about 103,800 people living with HIV in the UK.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the roll-out of the drug in England would eliminate new HIV infections within 10 years.

NHS England will pay for the drug.

The cost is estimated to likely be much less than the lifetime bill for treating those who already carry the virus.

The Terrence Higgins Trust, a charity that supports those living with HIV, estimates that about 7% of the roughly 103,800 people living with the virus in the UK do not know they are HIV positive.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'People think using PrEP means you put it about'

Ian Green, Chief Executive at the Terrence Higgins Trust, described the development as a ""game-changer"" for HIV prevention.

But he said more work needed to be done to ensure the benefits of PrEP were made clear to groups other than gay and bisexual men, such as women, trans people and BAME communities.

Sir Elton John, whose foundation supports HIV prevention and treatment, welcomed the government's decision.

""Taking PrEP prevents HIV from being passed on, which is truly incredible,"" he told the Sunday Times.

""It is the right decision for the UK government to roll this out more widely to minimise the spread of this disease so more people are protected - which is critical in fighting any epidemic.""

What is PrEP?

A pill taken daily, or on demand prior to having sex, to prevent HIV infection

If taken consistently, when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV, it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying

A UK Medical Research Council-run study comparing gay men on PrEP against non-users found an 86% fall in new HIV infections in PrEP users

Many in the sexual health sector say PrEP, when taken correctly, is almost 100% effective

It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk, including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed

Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections

But PrEP does have its critics, with some commentators saying funding it will lead to an abdication of personal responsibility, with men choosing not to use condoms.

Unlike condoms, PrEP does not protect against other sexually-transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea - of which the numbers of infections are rising.

In 2018, new HIV diagnoses in the UK fell to their lowest level since 2000 - 4,484 people - due to the success of preventative measures, Public Health England said.

The decline has been attributed to a mix of prevention methods, such as testing, condom provision, and the wider use of PrEP.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51897856,BBC,Health,True
296,,Coronavirus: Planned surgery cancelled in Wales,"Image copyright sudok1/Getty Images

Planned surgery is to be cancelled in Wales as the NHS gears up to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.

On Saturday, Public Health Wales said the number of cases had risen to 60.

Cutting back on so-called ""elective"" operations - those waiting for non-urgent treatment - had been put forward as one of the likely options as the pandemic escalates and more patients with the virus need treating.

Non-urgent outpatient appointments will also be put on hold.

Waiting time targets and monitoring arrangements are also being relaxed.

Meanwhile, Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies has defended the decision to postpone Wales' Six Nations game with Scotland, just 24 hours before kick-off.

Also, Cardiff City have confirmed a player and member of staff are self-isolating as a precaution, while a Wrexham FC player has been told to self-isolate after seeking medical advice, with the team's weekend game against Barrow postponed.

Image caption First Minister Mark Drakeford, flanked by health minister Vaughan Gething and NHS Wales chief executive Dr Andrew Goodall

Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""I am choosing to act now before we see a significant surge in demand so that our services can be ready to act. A larger number of people requiring high levels of care is highly likely over the coming weeks.""

He stressed that access to cancer and other essential treatments such as kidney dialysis would continue.

The minister said the priority was to save as many lives as possible, with 25,000 deaths in Wales possible in a worst case scenario.

What actions have been outlined?

Suspending non-urgent outpatient appointments to ensure urgent appointments were prioritised

Suspending non-urgent surgical admissions and procedures - but ensuring access for emergency and urgent surgery

Prioritising the use of non-emergency patient transport to focus on hospital discharges and ambulance emergency response

Expediting discharge of vulnerable patients from acute and community hospitals

Relaxing targets and monitoring arrangements across the health and care system

Minimising regulation requirements for health and care settings

Fast-tracking placements to care homes by suspending the current protocol which gives to right to a choice of home

Giving permission to cancel internal and professional events, including study leave, to free up staff for preparations

Relaxing contract and monitoring arrangements for GPs and primary care practitioners

Suspending NHS emergency service and health volunteer support to mass gatherings and events

EASY STEPS: How to keep safe

With the peak believed to be 10 to 14 weeks away, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was about making the ""right decisions at the right time"".

Earlier on Friday, the Welsh Government hinted at the move, saying it would need to consider reducing planned activity.

There are currently about 390,000 referrals waiting for hospital treatment in Wales - including some patients on multiple waiting lists. These include 47,000 orthopaedic referrals.

There were also 3 million outpatient appointments in the past year.

This could mean some quite big operations, including heart surgery, will be postponed for people - particularly if patients require intensive care afterwards.

But clinical decisions will have to be made if the conditions of patients deteriorate as they wait and they become emergencies.

We are used to seeing the temporary cancellation of planned surgery used as a pressure valve in the NHS by individual health boards, to relieve demand during winter pressures.

But in the wake of this crisis and the anticipated demand, to see this directed centrally by NHS Wales, is unprecedented.

Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""We would ask members of the public to help by being patient and understanding staff are working tirelessly.

""It is important to remember that we all have a responsibility to take precautions to minimise the chances of catching or spreading Covid-19"".

On Wednesday, a senior intensive care consultant warned about the supply of beds and staffing, because critical care units normally work at more than 90% capacity.

Dr Jack Parry-Jones, Welsh board member for the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said Wales was ""uniquely at risk"" if there was a surge of very sick people.

Europe is now the ""epicentre"" of the global coronavirus pandemic, the head of the World Health Organization says.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to use aggressive measures, community mobilisation and social distancing to save lives.

""Do not just let this fire burn,"" he said.

His comments came as several European countries reported steep rises in infections and deaths. Italy has recorded its highest daily toll yet.

There were 250 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 1,266, with 17,660 infections overall.

Spain, the worst-affected European country after Italy, reported a 50% jump in fatalities to 120 on Friday. Infections increased to 4,231.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says a state of alert will come into effect there on Saturday for two weeks.

Controls are also being introduced at an increasing number of borders in Europe, in response to rapid spread of the virus.

Why is Europe the 'epicentre'?

More than 132,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in 123 countries around the world, according to the WHO.

The total number of deaths has reached about 5,000 - a figure Dr Tedros described as ""a tragic milestone"".

""Europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China,"" he said.

""More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic.""

As well as the increases in Spain and Italy, France has now confirmed 2,876 cases and 79 deaths, up from a total of 61 deaths on Thursday.

Germany has seen 3,062 cases and five deaths. There have been 798 confirmed infections in the UK and 11 deaths.

What are European countries doing about it?

Announcing the state of alert in Spain, Mr Sanchez said the government would ""mobilise all the resources of state to better protect the health of all of its citizens"".

It will be able to limit movement, order evacuations, prohibit access to certain places and intervene in industry for up to 15 days.

""Victory depends on every single one of us,"" Mr Sanchez said. ""Heroism is also about washing your hands and staying at home.""

All but ""essential travel"" to parts of Spain should be avoided, says the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Italy has imposed a nationwide lockdown.

Meanwhile, at least 10 other countries in Europe are enforcing border closures, including:

Germany's Bundesliga, the only one of the big five European football leagues still being played, is to suspend games in the top two divisions from Tuesday.

Paris's Louvre - the largest art museum in the world - announced it would close from Friday, as will the Eiffel Tower.

Why Europe could be worse off than China

The number of cases of coronavirus reported every day in Europe has surpassed China at its peak.

But Europe is in a worse position.

The overwhelming majority of China's cases were in one place, Hubei province and those were largely concentrated in one city, Wuhan.

It was dealt with by an authoritarian government that imposed the biggest quarantine in human history.

While there are hotspots in Europe, this is an outbreak across a continent and different countries are adopting very different strategies for dealing with coronavirus.

All these figures are based on cases that have been detected, but scientists fear there could be large outbreaks going on unnoticed in countries that don't have the tools to spot them.

299,"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus: Why is the UK not shutting schools like other countries?,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's ""nuanced"" approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

Many countries are taking tough measures to crack down on the spread of coronavirus, including school closures, an end to mass gatherings and severe travel restrictions. But the UK has adopted relatively modest control measures.

The differences can be partly explained by the fact some of these countries are further into their epidemics. But it's clear the UK has adopted a more nuanced approach.

Computer simulations indicate the UK is in the early stages of its epidemic which is expected to rise sharply in four weeks and peak in 10 and 14 weeks' time.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, and chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty have made the judgement call that it is too soon to impose severe restrictions at this stage.

Such restrictions might last several months and risk ""self-isolation fatigue"", with people leaving their homes just as the epidemic was at its height. The elderly are particularly at risk of developing severe symptoms. But many of them are already isolated. Cutting them off from their communities at this stage, when the risks are still relatively low, would create unnecessary difficulties for them.

Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty have also advised against the suspension of mass gatherings. Again, their computer models indicate this would be less effective and more disruptive than the measures they have recommended: hand washing and asking people to self-isolate if they show symptoms of the disease.

These measures, if correctly implemented, could cut the peak of cases by 20%, says Sir Patrick.

""People are very much more likely to catch the virus from a family member or a friend somewhere in a small space rather than a big space [such as a sporting stadium],"" he said.

It's the same with school closures. While Ireland, France and Denmark are among a host of northern European countries to shut schools, for the moment at least they remain open in the UK.

Closing schools is effective for controlling serious flu epidemics, but Covid-19 seems to affect children less. There's still a risk, though, they could transmit it to their parents and grandparents. In addition, school closures would take many much needed NHS staff away from their jobs while they look after their children.

The British strategy is to delay the onset of the peak of the disease until the summer months, when the NHS is under less pressure, and to spread the peak of the epidemic to make treatment more manageable. The aim has also been to manage the spread of the infection so that the population builds up some immunity to the virus should it return in successive years.

Efforts to stamp it out too quickly risk leading to the epidemic returning, perhaps during the winter, once the extreme measures have been lifted. This would be a time when the health service was again under pressure.

It is important to stress that this strategy has been drawn up based on evidence and input from many of the world's leading scientists and doctors, many of whom have been involved in controlling the spread of the virus in China and Singapore. And it is notable that no UK epidemiologists - specialists in the spread of diseases - have spoken out in the mainstream media against the UK government's approach.

There are undoubtedly some who do disagree with the strategy. But there is an acceptance by such critics that Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty are the ones in the hot seat, having to make the biggest calls they have made in their professional lives. So the science community is prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and not speak out, for now at least.

The outbreak is putting the Italian healthcare service under immense strain. But will the UK follow this path?

On Thursday, Boris Johnson's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the UK was four weeks behind Italy ""in terms of the scale of the outbreak"" if not ""in terms of the response"".

Does that mean we're four weeks away from a similar fate?

Not necessarily. Here are three reasons why experts believe the UK's epidemic could be different from Italy's, and why the number of cases here means something different.

1. Different early transmission

The number of confirmed cases is not the same as the number of actual cases. It depends on how many infected people are detected.

The epidemics in both countries may be growing at a similar rate now, but early on the UK had more diagnosed cases than Italy. Italian numbers shot up on 23 February, leading scientists to think there was a period when the virus was spreading without being detected.

That gave less room for measures like tracing contacts of those who had fallen ill and isolating cases to slow the spread.

Professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth says that put the health system ""behind the curve"" in controlling the epidemic.

Researchers also warn that the Italy virus testing system has become overwhelmed and is not keeping up with new cases. This means Italy's figures could be falling further behind the total number of actual cases.

And as the UK adds more testing capacity, Prof Whitworth adds, we might see a ""jump in numbers"" - not just a result of greater transmission, but better detection.

2. Italy's epidemic is more concentrated

The pressure on health services also depends on where, and how severe, each case is.

There are good reasons to believe that these factors are different for the two countries. Since the initial spread, most of Italy's epidemic has been concentrated in the northern region of Lombardy, home to just over 15% of Italians.

Lombardy has accounted for almost 60 in every 100 cases in Italy. By contrast, the epidemic, so far, is more spread out in the UK. Like Lombardy, London has about 15% of citizens. But it has a smaller proportion of cases: just under 25 in 100.

So 15,000 cases spread out across the UK might not put the same pressure on hospitals as they would if they were mainly in one city or region.

The UK government is still planning for a time when the NHS will face significant challenges. But that may not be when we catch up with Italy's current number of confirmed cases.

3. More of Italy's confirmed cases are fatal

The death rate among confirmed cases in Italy is higher than in the UK. As of 12 March, the mortality rates among detected cases were 1.4% for the UK and 6.7% for Italy.

Prof Whitworth believes a higher death rate in Italy could mean that the observed cases contain a larger number of sicker patients. Italy has an older population than the UK, and the effects of Covid-19 infection have been more serious in older people.

That puts more pressure on services.

The alternative explanation for the higher death rate is that Italy's is an overwhelmed health service.

Don't relax quite yet

Even though our epidemic may not follow Italy's exactly, that doesn't mean the UK will escape serious changes to its way of life.

Epidemiologist Adam Kucharski warns against simple comparisons of case numbers and that ""without efforts to control the virus we could still see a situation evolve like that in Italy"", even if not necessarily in the next four weeks.

301,"['James Gallagher', 'Health', 'Science Correspondent']",Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,"Coronavirus has spread to more than 140 countries or territories, including the UK, and claimed more than 5,700 lives.

So, what is the disease and how does it spread?

How do I protect myself?

The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.

Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on then your eyes, nose or mouth.

So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important for limiting the spread.

Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts.

What are the coronavirus symptoms?

Coronavirus infects the lungs. The symptoms start with a fever followed by a dry cough, which can lead to breathing problems.

It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.

The incubation period lasts up to 14 days, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days.

People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but there have been suggestions some can spread the virus even before they are sick.

The early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

How deadly is coronavirus?

The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable.

Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported.

A World Health Organization examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests:

6% become critically ill - lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death

14% develop severe symptoms - difficulty breathing and shortness of breath

80% develop mild symptoms - fever and cough and some may have pneumonia

Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. The data from China also suggests that men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.

Treatment relies on keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight off the virus. Work to develop a vaccine is under way.

What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?

The NHS says an epidemic in the UK is ""likely"".

Patients with mild symptoms - such as a new continuous cough or a high temperature above 37.8C- should self-isolate at home for at least seven days, according to the latest advice issued by Public Health England on Friday.

Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.

Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP.

If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. People needing to do so should take ""common-sense"" steps to avoid close contact with other people, says Public Health England.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from affected areas and who may need to self-isolate, has been issued.

Other countries have introduced their own measures For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people showing symptoms to call their healthcare provider, and those who are mildly ill to self-isolate.

The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public.

Who gets tested and how does it work?

In its latest advice, Public Health England (PHE) has said those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms will not be tested.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms will be tested.

If you need testing in the UK, you may have to give samples of mucus, blood or faeces. These will be tested and results may be available on the same day.

While you await your test results, you may be asked to stay at home and self-isolate.

How fast is it spreading?

Hundreds of new cases are being reported worldwide each day. However, it is thought health agencies may be unaware of many cases.

After starting in China, coronavirus is now spreading fast in countries like South Korea, Italy and Iran.

The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.

For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.

So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?

Incubation period

This is when the virus is establishing itself.

Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.

The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.

It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.

At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.

The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.

Mild disease

This is all most people will experience.

Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.

Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.

The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.

These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.

The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.

Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.

These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.

This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.

However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.

This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.

Severe disease

If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.

Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.

""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia

Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.

If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.

This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.

This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.

Critical disease

It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.

By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.

The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.

It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.

""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.

And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A patient being treated with an ECMO machine

Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.

This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.

But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.

The first deaths

Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.

The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.

The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.

He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.

He died 11 days after he was admitted.

The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.

He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.

303,,Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation?,"Image copyright Getty Images

More people in the UK should isolate themselves to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced.

So, what do you need to know about self-isolation and how to do it?

What is self-isolation?

Self-isolation means cutting yourself off from the rest of the world.

You need to stay at home, not go to work, school or other public places, and avoid public transport or taxis, says Public Health England.

""Common-sense"" steps include staying in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keeping away from other people in your home.

Ask for help if you need groceries, other shopping or medication.

It's OK to have friends, family or delivery drivers drop off supplies to get you through.

But you shouldn't have any visitors, PHE says. You can have deliveries left on the doorstep.

Do I need to self-isolate?

From Friday, everyone with flu-like symptoms - defined as a fever of above 37.8C or a persistent cough - is being asked to stay at home for at least seven days.

Anyone who has travelled to an affected area, or who has been in close contact with an infected person, had already been asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

Spending 15 minutes within 2m (6ft) of someone with the virus, or having face-to-face contact, is judged as close contact and a significant risk.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from the main affected areas and some other countries has been issued by the government. Full details of the countries concerned and whether you need to self-isolate are available here.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

The Covid-19 disease can cause a fever, cough and breathing problems. It takes five days on average for people to start showing the symptoms.

What if someone self-isolating shares a home?

If you are self-isolating and share a kitchen, try to avoid using it when other people are there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Clean all the surfaces at home with household cleaning products daily.

Although you might not be able to entirely separate yourself from family members or flatmates, the advice is to limit contact as much as possible.

If possible stay at least 2m (6ft) from other people you live with and sleep alone. Keep away from vulnerable people.

People living with someone in isolation should wash their hands often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds - especially after coming into contact with them.

You shouldn't share towels, toiletries or other household items with someone in isolation and they should have a separate bathroom. If that is not possible, the isolated person should use the bathroom last, cleaning it thoroughly afterwards if they are able.

Any rubbish that the isolated person has been in contact with should be double-bagged and kept. If the person tests positive, you will be told what to do with their waste.

Will I still get paid?

Workers will get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, not the fourth, to help contain coronavirus, the prime minister has said.

This means that people who have to self-isolate or who are ill would get an extra £40 to cover the first four days. This would take it up to its usual rate of £94.25 per week.

Many casual or agency workers may also be entitled to sick pay but self-employed people are not. Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick pay and should ask their employer.

In the meantime, the government says you can claim universal credit or employment and support allowance if you're prevented from working for public health reasons.

If you need to care for a relative or your child's school is closed and you need to look after them at short notice, your employer must give you time off, but it may be unpaid.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,BBC,Health,True
304,,Coronavirus elderly advice: How can I look after my older relatives?,"Image copyright EPA

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drop-off point to receive samples of the coronavirus for testing at Leeds General Infirmary

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

""We're all reaching that critical point now where we have to take stock and go, if I go to my parents I could be carrying something that could kill them. That's the reality of it.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Some people are wearing face masks although the government does not advise it

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Mental health charity Mind also has tips for those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Age UK's online advice adds: ""The government hasn't said we should stop going out or meeting up with other people.

""Most people can keep doing what they normally do as long as they don't have symptoms and maintain good hygiene practices like washing their hands regularly. You only need to stay at home and avoid contact with other people (called 'self-isolating') if you've been advised to by NHS 111 or a medical professional.""

305,"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']",Coronavirus: What next in the UK coronavirus fight?,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

The following maps, charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are dealing with it.

1. The number of UK cases is growing

The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January.

While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase significantly at the beginning of March.

Since then, cases have been reported across the UK, with 232 new cases announced on Sunday.

Most confirmed cases are in England, which has more than 1,000. But Scotland has 153 confirmed cases, Wales has 94 and Northern Ireland has 45.

Confirmed case numbers for the UK are lower than other European countries, such as Italy, for example, where there have been more than 21,000 cases and more than 1,400 deaths, according to 15 March figures from the World Health Organization.

However, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said there are probably between 5,000 and 10,000 people infected in the UK at this time.

He also said that many people will no longer be tested if they are showing mild symptoms. Only those with the most serious symptoms will be given a test in hospital.

England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the UK outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.

Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 140,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 5,700 deaths.

More than half the cases - about 80,000 - are in China, where the virus originated in December.

2. We are in the second phase of the government's response

The government has published its action plan for dealing with the virus, which involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research.

While the emphasis has been on the contain and research phases up until this week, the country has now moved to the ""delay"" phase to stop the wider spread of the virus.

As part of the delay phase, people with even mild coronavirus symptoms - defined as a temperature above 37.8 C or a ""new, continuous"" cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home for seven days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.

Schools are also being advised to cancel trips abroad and people over 70 and those with pre-existing health conditions are being told not to go on cruises.

The delay phase could also mean further ""social distancing"" measures at a later date, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out closing schools at this stage.

Action to isolate the over-70s for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus is planned in the coming weeks, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed.

Government sources have also said mass gatherings might soon be banned to ease pressure on emergency services.

If the virus becomes even more widespread, the government may then decide to enter the third phase of mitigation, when health services are asked to focus on critical care and retired NHS staff could be asked to return to work.

3. People who think they have coronavirus should self-isolate

If you have a ""new, continuous"" cough or high temperature and think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you should self isolate for seven days.

If symptoms persist beyond seven days or if you get worse you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service if you are in England.

In Scotland, you should call your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. In Wales call 111 (if available in your area) or 0845 46 47. In Northern Ireland call 111.

Testing will now only focus on identifying people with the virus in hospital.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,BBC,Health,True

The UK government is now focusing on delaying the spread of coronavirus. But what might an outbreak mean for you, your job and your finances?

Here are the answers to a selection of readers' questions. (Let us know your coronavirus questions by using the form at the bottom of this article).

I run a small business. At what point should I tell people to work from home? - Kieren Johnstone, Horsham

It's really all about following government advice at this stage.

Many firms are already trialling home-working for office-based staff before any potential quarantine. This lets them test home working in a controlled way, before having to do it for real.

As a small business, you'll also need to think about your the way you are supplied, travel and your cashflow.

Also, check your insurance. Does the small print include business interruption cover? If so, does your policy have an extension for ""notifiable diseases""? Also, check if coronavirus is covered.

I'm self-employed. Can I claim benefits if I can't work due to the virus? - Mark Gribby, Nottingham

Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits, Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance.

But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before Universal Credit is paid.

People claiming Universal Credit can be paid early to help them until they receive their first payment. However, this will be taken off future benefit payments.

Unfortunately, those who are self-employed cannot get Statutory Sick Pay because that is paid by an employer.

Ask me

Will lenders be allowing people with mortgages to delay payments during the outbreak? - Clare Waters

Some banks, including NatWest and TSB, are offering customers affected by coronavirus the ability to delay their mortgage payments.

This will be decided on a case-by-case basis, a bit like the process of helping customers in financial difficulty.

Payments will be delayed for two or three months. So, it is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance.

Most probably, any future monthly mortgage bills will be slightly higher.

What will landlords do if coronavirus means people can't pay their rent? - The Urban Troopers via Twitter

At the moment, landlords are not being forced to allow tenants to delay paying their rent.

But they are being encouraged to be sympathetic if tenants have to self-isolate, or are laid off work and take a hit to their income.

The Residential Landlords Association says its members should discuss the problem with tenants, be flexible and arrange for money they owe to be repaid when things return to normal.

Most affected tenants, it says, will be in genuine hardship and suffering stress.

What if you're not on a salary and can't work from home if your workplace closes? - Joseph, Glasgow

If you are employed, your employer has an obligation to pay your Statutory Sick Pay for up to 28 weeks.

Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay Statutory Sick Pay from the first day off.

In the case of small employers, the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days,

Eligible employees are entitled to £94.25 a week.

I am buying a house. What if one party self-isolates after exchanging contracts? - Linda Lawford, Totton

When you exchange contracts for a property, you have made a contract. You would be liable to lose your deposit if you fail to complete the sale and, possibly, face a claim for damages.

In exceptional circumstances, the buyer and seller can agree to delay in completing the sale.

However, self-isolating would not necessarily mean you could not complete. This final step could be done over the phone or online.

At what point will the government advise people not to travel in confined spaces? - Lou Doret, Exeter

When its health experts advise it to do so. However, this might never happen.

For now, transport bosses in the UK say they're reviewing cleaning procedures. Transport for London says it's using a more powerful disinfectant.

Meanwhile, it's been announced that a London Underground train driver has tested positive for coronavirus.

Passenger numbers on trains have fallen as more people work at home.

Will panic buying continue to affect supermarkets? - Thomas, Porthmadog

The issue has been getting stock onto shelves quick enough to fill the gaps as shoppers strip them bare of certain products.

There has been a specific problem with hand sanitisers, where demand has outstripped supply.

But overall, the key message is that we're not going to run out of food. Shoppers should buy what they need.

If things take a serious turn for the worse, all our supermarkets have plans in place to keep us fed. The big challenge will be doing this with potentially far fewer workers.

Image copyright Getty Images

If schools are closed will there be financial help available for parents? - Richard, Eastleigh

Employers have to give you time off to deal with a domestic emergency, but they don't have to pay you.

The time you take has to be a reasonable amount. You can apply for some unpaid leave as well.

And the government has relaxed the rules for applying for benefits if you have coronavirus.

Volunteers are rallying round to help out those isolating themselves to prevent coronavirus spreading in their communities and around the country.

Groups in areas such as London and Cornwall are poised to get supplies to people unable to leave home in the coming weeks to contain Covid-19.

A 17-year-old boy who has set up a volunteer group in London said: ""It's only right that we help out.""

Public Health England (PHE) has advised people to self-isolate safely.

A major coronavirus epidemic is expected in the UK and PHE is working to contain the virus, which has resulted in six deaths and 382 confirmed cases.

The government has outlined emergency legislation to tackle the virus, including measures to allow people to leave their jobs and volunteer to care for those affected.

He has been in contact with his local MP and health trust, and so far has four other local cadets willing to help out.

""I read that someone of our age is more likely to win the lottery than die from coronavirus so it's only right that we help out. You never know when we might need help in the future,"" he said.

""I think lots of people are prepared to volunteer and hopefully our group will give them a place to focus.""

About 50 people have added their names to a database set up by Volunteer Cornwall specifically to help out as more people self-isolate.

Andy Brelsford from the group said it also has an additional 50 people in emergency situations.

""Our worry is that people are being told to self-isolate for two weeks and at the end of that we find out that they haven't had any food to eat or had anything to drink.

""We want to make sure everybody has got somebody to keep them supplied.""

PHE has advised people who are self-isolating to do what they can to avoid visitors to their home and has urged any deliveries of groceries, medications or other shopping to be left at the door.

Charlotte Barry, from Wadebridge, said: ""I am an obvious person to get involved. I'm retired, time-rich, don't fall sick easily and am not in regular contact with anyone who is elderly or has underlying health conditions.

""We have a lot of elderly people in Cornwall. A lot of them have retired down here and so don't have the family backing that locals have.

""So these people are among the most vulnerable as they don't have anybody obvious to fall back on.""

Some volunteers, including in Shropshire are helping health centres deliver medical supplies to patients.

The Bridgnorth Medical Centre said on social media ""we have a small number of volunteers who can visit our most vulnerable patients/collect shopping etc, subject to availability"".

Coronavirus can affect anyone, but people with pre-existing health problems and older people are thought to be at greater risk of developing severe symptoms.

If you have a long-term health condition you may be feeling anxious. So here's what experts are advising.

Who is at risk?

Having a health condition does not make you more likely than anyone else to contract coronavirus, which is a respiratory disease.

But it appears people who are older, those with weakened immune systems and people who have underlying chronic conditions including asthma, diabetes or heart disease are more at risk of severe effects.

Most people recover from coronavirus quickly after a few days' rest. For some people, it can be more severe and, in rare cases, life-threatening. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu:

a cough

a high temperature

shortness of breath

I have asthma, what should I do?

Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your preventer inhaler (usually brown) daily as prescribed. This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.

Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service.

I'm elderly, should I self-isolate?

The latest advice from the government's chief medical adviser is that pensioners currently do not need to be self-isolating.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Older people and their families can also call Age UK Advice for free on 0800 169 65 65.

What if I have a chronic health issue?

Those with underlying medical issues such as high blood pressure, lung complaints and weakened or compromised immune systems are more likely to develop serious illness as a result of the disease.

Anyone with a higher risk from viruses such as cold or flu should take sensible steps to reduce the risk of picking up infections, and call your doctor if you're feeling unwell.

Those who begin to show symptoms should immediately contact their GP or NHS 111 for advice.

I have diabetes, what should I do?

Those living with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes could be at greater risk of more severe symptoms. Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: ""Coronavirus or Covid-19 can cause complications in people with diabetes.

""If you have diabetes and you have symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, you need to monitor your blood sugar closely and call the NHS 111 phone service.""

Should pregnant women worry?

There is no evidence yet that pregnant women are a high-risk group. Like anyone, they should take steps to avoid infection.

I'm a smoker, am I at higher risk?

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of public health charity, Ash, advises that those who smoke heavily should either cut back or try to quit entirely to lower their risk.

""Smokers are more likely to get respiratory infections and twice as likely to develop pneumonia as non-smokers,"" she said.

""Quitting smoking is good for your health in so many ways and smokers should see coronavirus as further motivation to give quitting a go to build up their body's defences now before coronavirus becomes widespread in the UK.""

What about my medication?

It is important that even if you are unwell, you continue to take your prescribed medication. If you need to collect prescriptions while unwell, ask a friend or family member to collect them for you.

Do I need a flu jab?

Coronavirus is an entirely different virus to flu, so the flu jab won't prevent infection, but flu can also make you sick and can be severe in certain people.

If you have not yet had your flu jab there is still time to get one. People aged 65 and over, pregnant women and children and adults with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems can get one for free on the NHS.

So how can I stay safe?

The virus is thought to be spread by coughs and via contaminated surfaces, such as handrails and door handles in public places.

Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading:

Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze

Put used tissues in the bin immediately

Wash your hands with soap and water often - use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available

Try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell

Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean

Should I use a face mask or avoid public places?

The British Lung Foundation says it does not recommend using a face mask ""as there isn't enough evidence to show how effective they are. Also, for people living with a lung condition wearing a face mask can make breathing more difficult.""

311,"['Robert Cuffe', 'Head Of Statistics']",Coronavirus death rate: What are the chances of dying?,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 50 countries have now confirmed cases

Researchers currently think that between five and 40 coronavirus cases in 1,000 will result in death, with a best guess of nine in 1,000 or about 1%.

On Tuesday, the World Health Organization's Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that ""globally, about 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases have died"".

Scientists' estimate of the death rate is lower because not all cases are reported.

On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK government's ""very best assessment"" was that the mortality rate was ""2% or, likely, lower"".

But it depends on a range of factors: your age, sex and general health and the health system you are in.

How hard is it to work out the death rate?

It is PhD-level hard. Even counting cases is tricky.

Most cases of most viruses will go uncounted because people tend not to visit the doctor with mild symptoms.

The different death rates we are seeing reported around the world are unlikely to be due to different versions of the virus.

According to research by Imperial College, it's because different countries are better or worse at spotting the milder, harder to count cases.

So under-reporting cases makes it easy to overestimate the death rate. But you can also get it wrong in the other direction.

It takes time before an infection results in recovery or death.

If you include all cases that haven't yet had a chance to run their course, you will underestimate the death rate because you are missing the cases that will end in death later.

Scientists combine individual pieces of evidence about each of these questions to build a picture of the death rate.

For example, they estimate the proportion of cases with mild symptoms from small, defined groups of people who are monitored very tightly, like people on repatriated flights.

But slightly different answers from those pieces of evidence will add up to big changes in the overall picture.

If you just use data from Hubei, where the death rate has been much higher than elsewhere in China, then the overall death rate will look much worse.

So scientists give a range as well as a best current estimate.

But even that doesn't tell the full story because there is no single death rate.

What's the risk for people like me?

Even though the death rates among confirmed cases don't tell us about the precise risk in any single group, their patterns can tell us about who is most at risk.

Some types of people are more likely to die if they contract coronavirus: the elderly, the unwell and, maybe, men.

In the first big analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was ten times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged.

The death rates were lowest for the under 30s - there were eight deaths in 4,500 cases.

And deaths were at least five times more common among people with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart or breathing problems.

There was even a slightly higher number of deaths among men compared to women.

All of these factors interact with each other and we don't yet have a complete picture of the risk for every type of person in every location.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At least 621 people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan

What's the risk for people where I live?

A group of 80-year-old men in China could have very different risks to men of the same age in Europe or Africa.

Your prognosis also depends on the treatment you get.

In turn, that depends on what is available and the stage of the epidemic.

If the epidemic takes off, then healthcare systems could get swamped with cases - there are only so many intensive care units or ventilators available in any given area.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronavirus patients in England are being treated at a specialist centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London

Is it more dangerous than flu?

We can't compare mortality rates because many people with mild flu symptoms choose never to visit a doctor.

So we don't know how many cases there are of flu, or any new virus every year.

But flu continues to kill people in the UK, as it does every winter.

As the data evolves, scientists will develop a clearer picture of who would be most at risk should a coronavirus outbreak arrive in the UK.

The basic advice from the WHO is that you can protect yourself from all respiratory viruses by washing your hands, avoiding people who are coughing and sneezing and trying not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth.

With the number of coronavirus patients rising around the world, children are being exposed to information and misinformation from many sources. How can parents best keep them up to date without terrifying them?

""Will I get sick?""

""Will my school close?""

""Will grandma or granddad die?""

Coronavirus is dominating the news and children, as always, are asking direct, difficult questions about what's going to happen.

While the risk of young people being seriously affected by the virus appears low, doom-laden social media posts and playground rumours can induce panic.

Stories of deaths, possible food shortages and school closures, and the circulation of phrases like ""pandemic potential"" can add to a sense of alarm.

Keeping control

So tone is vital when discussing coronavirus with a child, advises Angharad Rudkin, clinical psychologist and consultant on the parenting book What's My Child Thinking?

""We all enjoy scare stories to a degree, but we don't like to hear them quite so much when they're a bit closer to home,"" she says. ""Help your child put some distance between them and the threat by giving information about how coronavirus is spread and what we can do to help minimise the risk such as using loads of lovely bubbles when washing our hands.""

Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus which seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. After about a week, it leads to shortness of breath and some patients require hospital treatment.

Medics aren't sure exactly how it spreads from person to person, but similar viruses do so via droplets, such as those produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

It's essential to talk to a child about things he or she can control, such as disposing of tissues and personal hygiene, Dr Rudkin says, rather than those they cannot.

Once the explanation is over, the conversation should move on to something that ""isn't threatening, such as what they had for lunch or who do they think is going to win the football match this evening"", she adds.

The virus could affect millions of people around the world soon. The UK government says, in its latest plans, that up to a fifth of workers could be off sick at the peak of an epidemic, with school closures possible.

One problem in explaining the virus is that it's difficult to predict what will happen, though early, albeit limited, evidence suggests children with Covid-19 have tended to show mild symptoms.

While parents have long experience in explaining global threats - war, terrorism and climate change - pre-adolescent children are still developing their ability to assess risk, says Dr Rudkin. So it's important to find out what their level of worry over coronavirus is.

""Be clear that you don't know all of the answers but that there are people making decisions for us who have all the information they need.""

Parents, in turn, should be as informed as possible before explaining issues to children, including keeping up with official advice, Dr Rudkin says.

In the event that a boy or girl catches coronavirus, parents are advised not to overplay any risk to their health.

""You could tell them it's 'a bit like feeling sore', so they get to see it's not as dreadful as they might believe,"" Jon Gilmartin, a speech language therapist at the children's communication charity I Can, says.

Older people and those with existing health conditions are thought to be most at risk of death or serious sickness from catching coronavirus. This could lead children to worry about older friends and relatives.

Dr Rudkin advises honesty over the argument ""we will all die eventually but chances are not until we are really, really old"".

Use simple language

""But we can talk about it with a smile and use humour, or at least a lightness of touch, that doesn't then plummet our children into an existential pit they really don't need to be in, until they're 13 at least,"" she adds. ""Reassure your child that you and granddad are really fit and strong and that you will continue to do all you can to keep yourself/granddad healthy and safe.""

Children's capacity to deal with complex and worrying information increases with age, so the way a parent speaks to a three-year-old is very different to dealing with a teenager - and it involves a personal judgement.

But Mr Gilmartin suggests the use of ""simple language"" for all age groups and allowing children to ask ""lots of questions"" to show they're being listened to.

Parents who themselves are looking for the right language to use, could start with the BBC's Newsround coverage.

Children, like the rest of the population, are exposed to myths and misinformation about coronavirus, via playground gossip and, particularly among pre-teens and teenagers, on social media.

The best way to combat this is providing ""age-appropriate information and reassurance"", says Dr Rudkin, as the source young people trust best is a parent.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51734855,BBC,Health,True

Apple's annual showcase, the Worldwide Developers Conference, has been cancelled in favour of an online-only event.

""The current health situation has required that we create a new WWDC 2020 format,"" Apple said in a statement.

The June conference is often used to announce new products and software features.

Only open to Apple software developers, the $1,600 (£1,280) tickets sell out every year.

Apple said it ""will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June...[in] an entirely new online format"".

Full details will follow in the coming weeks, but Phil Schiller, the company's marketing chief, promised ""a full programme with an online keynote and sessions"".

The company will also put $1m (£800,000) towards local organisations in San Jose, California, ""to offset associated revenue loss as a result of WWDC 2020's new online format"".

The annual keynote speech from CEO Tim Cook is usually streamed online each year anyway, to a much larger audience than the one in the convention centre in San Jose.

There had been widespread speculation about the fate of the conference as the world battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Avoiding large gatherings is a key part of much public health advice.

Attendees in previous years have come from all over the globe. Apple says its developer programme includes 23 million people in 155 countries.

Last year's conference saw two major hardware announcements: a new Mac Pro, and the high-end Pro Display XDR monitor. The event also showcases new features coming to Apple's software, such as iOS and macOS.

Apple's physical gathering of thousands is the latest such technology event to be called off because of the coronavirus.

Earlier, the gaming industry's flagship event E3 was called off entirely, with a note that organisers were ""exploring options"" for an ""online experience"" in June.

The Ted conference of talks was also postponed, and organisers considered an online event as a replacement before opting for a later date.

The Game Developers Conference, SXSW, Mobile World Congress, and Google and Facebook's major conferences have also been hit.

Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance.

Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found.

The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns.

1. Click here for a cure

Image copyright Proofpoint Image caption Victims looking for a cure face having personal details stolen

Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments.

The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time.

""We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click,"" says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team.

Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day.

""It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals,"" says Ms DeGrippo.

The best way to see where a link will take you is to hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal the true web address. If it looks dodgy, don't click.

2. Covid-19 tax refund

Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours.

If a member of the public clicked on ""access your funds now"", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information.

""Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email,"" says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. ""And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund.""

3. Little measure that saves

Image copyright Proofpoint Image caption The World Health Organization is being impersonated by many hacking campaigns

Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread.

""This little measure can save you,"" they claim.

But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger.

This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online.

To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice.

4. The virus is now airborne

Image copyright Cofense Image caption Hackers are using fear-mongering tactics to encourge clicks and downloads

The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission.

It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool.

Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers ""weaponising fear and panic"".

It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic. Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account.

Cofense says the combination of a ""rather good forgery"" and a ""high stress situation"" make for a potent trap.

One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account.

5. Donate here to help the fight

Image copyright Kaspersky Image caption The CDC is not asking for donations in Bitcoin

This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing.

Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware.

315,,Pentagon to reconsider Jedi $10bn cloud contract,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Pentagon wants to replace ageing computer networks with a single cloud system

The US Department of Defense is to ""reconsider"" its decision to award a multi-billion dollar cloud contract to Microsoft over Amazon.

It comes in response to a court case brought by Amazon Web Services (AWS), claiming the decision was politically motivated.

President Trump had previously expressed concern about Amazon's bid.

In a court filing, the Pentagon said the U-turn was ""in response to.... technical challenges presented by AWS"".

Microsoft said it ""remained confident"" its bid was ""technologically superior"".

In a statement, it said: ""We believe the Department of Defense made the correct decision when they awarded the contract.

""However, we support their decision to reconsider a small number of factors as it is likely the fastest way to resolve all issues and quickly provide the needed modern technology to people across our armed forces.""

Amazon said it was pleased that the DoD had acknowledged the ""substantial and legitimate issues"" with the award decision.

The Pentagon has requested 120 days to reassess the award - its filing was based on pricing and not whether President Trump had interfered in the process.

In July last year, President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair, telling reporters he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"".

He has previously criticised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - who owns the Washington Post.

Only Microsoft and Amazon bid for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure (Jedi) contract and the latter had been seen as the favourite to win.

The new system is designed to replace the DoD's ageing computer networks with a single cloud system, which will host classified secrets and provide artificial intelligence-based analysis to the military.

In October, following a delay, the contract was awarded to Microsoft.

A month later Amazon began an appeal over the decision, saying: ""Numerous aspects of the Jedi evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias - and it's important that these matters be examined and rectified.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51869764,BBC,Tech,True
316,,Facebook closes African fake accounts targeting US voters,"Image copyright Reuters

Facebook and Twitter have taken down a network of African-based fake accounts linked to previously banned Russian trolls.

The social-media firms say the accounts, based in Ghana and Nigeria, were aimed at US citizens.

They said although none of the activity focused on elections or political candidates, the network had requested to run political ads there.

Twitter said the accounts attempted to ""sow discord"".

An investigation by Facebook, in conjunction with CNN, found some accounts posted as a charity based in Ghana.

The troll factory was run from the headquarters of Ebla (Eliminating Barriers for the Liberation of Africa), near Accra, according to the investigators.

Others posed as blogs or posted in Facebook groups. All of the fake accounts focused on topics such as black history, fashion, celebrity gossip, US news and LGBTQ issues.

Troll factory

They shared negative content about police brutality and oppression. One account posed in a Facebook group as the cousin of an African American who died in police custody, according to CNN.

Facebook said the accounts were relatively new and operating out of Africa on behalf of Russian individuals with links to notorious troll factory the Internet Research Agency.

It said its systems had rejected the requests to run political adverts in the US, and it has taken down 49 Facebook accounts, 85 on Instagram and 69 other pages.

These had about 278,000 followers, with around 65% of these based in the US.

Twitter also removed 71 accounts that had 68,000 followers. It said that the accounts had ""attempted to sow discord"" with conversations about race and civil rights.

Previously banned

In a blog detailing the investigation, Facebook said: ""We're constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don't want our services to be used to manipulate people.

""We're taking down these pages and accounts because this activity was linked to individuals associated with the Internet Research Agency, an entity we had previously banned from Facebook. They also used fake accounts and co-ordinated with one another to mislead people about what they were doing.

""That behaviour was the basis for our action, not the content they posted.""

The Internet Research Agency was accused of running a fake news campaign aimed at disrupting the 2016 presidential election, and in 2018 13 Russian trolls were indicted by the US Justice Department.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51869767,BBC,Tech,True
317,,Apple's China stores reopen after a month,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China is a major market for Apple - and the closures hit sales hard

Apple has reopened all of its Chinese stores, a month after shutting them down amid the coronavirus outbreak.

All 42 official Apple retail stores opened on Friday, although some stores had special business hours.

It shut the stores in mid-February, as China put several cities on effective lockdown in a bid to contain the virus.

The outbreak has slashed demand for new phones, with Apple selling less than half the iPhones it sold in February last year.

There have also been concerns about the supply of phones for Apple and other manufacturers, as many Chinese factories which make phone parts shut down for weeks.

Foxconn, which assembles Apple's phones in huge factories, said employees had returned to work in numbers that ""exceeded our expectations and imagination"" - and that supplies of parts had returned to normal, too.

But it had its largest drop in revenue in about seven years during the closures.

Apple, meanwhile, sold roughly 494,000 iPhones in China in February - compared to 1.27 million in February 2019.

China recorded just 19 new infections on Tuesday. President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, in a high-profile visit covered by state media.

BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonell said the visit was ""like a nationwide green light... a way of sending out a signal that the return to 'normality' should carry on apace.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51870725,BBC,Tech,True

Executives from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook met officials at Downing Street on Wednesday to discuss their role in the coronavirus crisis.

One of the things discussed was their role in ""modelling and tracking data"".

In similar meetings at the White House, meanwhile, companies were asked how they could use artificial intelligence.

A World Health Organization report last month said AI and big data were a key part of China's response to the virus.

Sharing data

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sharing data about the number of cases will be vital to see whether measures to slow the spread are working

Facebook is already working with researchers at Harvard University's School of Public Health and the National Tsing Hua University, in Taiwan, sharing anonymised data about people's movements and high-resolution population density maps, which help them forecast the spread of the virus.

The social network is also helping partners understand how people are talking about the issue online, via tools such as Crowdtangle, which aggregate social-media posts.

In the past, Google search data has been used to track infectious diseases.

To help people who want to track their own health, meanwhile, Google's life-science research arm, Verily is developing a small body-worn temperature patch that transmits data to a phone app.

""This could be especially useful in elderly populations, where viral infections have higher rates of morbidity and mortality,"" blogged chief executive Sundar Pichai.

Fighting misinformation

Image copyright Google Image caption People are turning to Google for the latest information about the virus

So far, there has not been any comprehensive study of how much misinformation remains on platforms such as Google and Facebook but it is likely to be substantial.

Google said its team was ""working round the clock to safeguard our users from phishing, conspiracy theories, malware and misinformation"".

Search for coronavirus or Covid-19, and an SOS Alert appears, alongside links to help and information about the virus.

YouTube, meanwhile, is using its homepage to direct users to the World Health Organization and other groups, for education and information, while working to remove videos suggesting alternative cures as soon as they go live.

Finding drugs

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An AI-discovered cure could be quicker than a traditional one but could still take many months

British start-up Exscienta became the first company to put a AI-designed drug molecule to human trials earlier this year.

It took just 12 months for algorithms to create it, compared with four to five years for traditional research.

AI could be used in three ways in the current crisis, according to chief executive Prof Andrew Hopkins:

to rapidly develop antibodies and vaccines for the Covid-19 virus

to scan through existing drugs to see if any could be repurposed

to design a drug to fight both the current and future coronavirus outbreaks

But he warned people to be realistic about what AI could achieve.

""The fastest this could be done is 18 to 24 months away, because of the manufacturing scale-up and all the safety testing that needs to be done,"" he said.

Google-owned AI company DeepMind, meanwhile, has used its AlphaFold system to release structure predictions of several proteins associated with the virus.

These have not yet been experimentally verified but DeepMind hopes this will help the scientific community's understanding of how the virus functions.

Scientists at both DeepMind and Exscienta praised the way those at the forefront of the outbreak had so quickly released data, which would be crucial for any algorithms searching for a cure.

Robot cleaners

Meanwhile, Prof Sabine Hauert, at Bristol University, told BBC News AI could simply make daily life easier during the crisis.

""It can also be used to put people out of harm's way, for example using robots to clean hospitals, or telepresence systems for remote meeting, consultations, or simply to connect with loved ones,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51851292,BBC,Tech,True
320,"['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Desk Editor']",Apps 'must check images for child abuse before publication',"Image copyright Getty Images

Internet companies must do more to tackle ""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuse on their platforms, a UK-held inquiry has concluded.

The panel also said the technology companies had ""failed to demonstrate"" they were fully aware of the number of under-13s using their services and lacked a plan to combat the problem.

It has called for all images to be screened before publication.

And it said more stringent age checks were also required.

'Reputational damage'

Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were identified as the most commonly cited apps where grooming was said to take place.

And the industry at large was accused of being ""reactive rather than proactive"" in response to the issues.

""Action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children,"" the inquiry said.

The report follows a series of public hearings, between January 2018 and May 2019, during which the police said they believed the UK was the world's third biggest consumer of live-streamed child sex abuse.

'Evil crime'

Facebook was one of the first to respond.

""[We] have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions,"" said its European head of safety, David Miles.

""As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe.""

Microsoft also promised to ""consider these findings carefully"", while Google said it would keep working with others to ""tackle this evil crime"".

Illegal imagery

The report said some steps should be taken before the end of September.

Leading its list is a requirement for screening before images appear online.

The report noted technologies such as Microsoft's PhotoDNA had made it possible for pictures to be quickly checked against databases of known illegal imagery without humans needing to look at them.

But at present, this filtering process typically happened after the material had already become available for others to see.

Officially banned

Users might be frustrated by a delay in seeing their content go live but, the panel said, it had not been told of any technical reason this process could not happen before publication.

The inquiry also said the UK government should introduce legislation to compel the companies involved to adopt more effective checks to deter under-age users.

Pre-teens were at ""particularly acute"" risk of being groomed, it said.

The panel recognised many services were officially banned to under-13s.

Child nudity

But it said in many cases, the only test was to require users to fill in a date-of-birth form, which could easily be falsified.

""There must be better means of ensuring compliance,"" it said.

The report acknowledged detecting and preventing the live-streaming of abuse was difficult but highlighted a French app as an example to learn from.

It said Yubo used algorithms to detect possible instances of child nudity, which a human moderator would then check to see if action if necessary.

Image copyright Yubo Image caption It was suggested the big social networks could learn from a smaller rival, Yubo

The panel also noted existing anti-abuse technologies did not work when communications were protected by end-to-end encryption, which digitally scrambles communications without giving platform providers a key.

The inquiry highlighted WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage and FaceTime already used the technique by default and Facebook intended to deploy it more widely soon.

However, it did not say how this should be addressed.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51851921,BBC,Tech,True

Amazon workers can take unlimited sick days this month - but only those in quarantine for the Covid-19 virus will be entitled to extra sick pay.

Many US warehouse workers are entitled to only 10 days' leave a year - for all holidays, sickness and emergencies.

And some had asked Amazon to change its policy to stop coronavirus spreading.

Some workers also say they are being told increase their hours, known as mandatory extra time, because of increased demand and staff shortages.

'Financial distress'

In a blog, Amazon said: ""The health and safety of our employees and contractors around the world continues to be our top priority as we face the challenges associated with Covid-19.

""Effective immediately, all Amazon employees diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed into quarantine will receive up to two weeks of pay.

""This additional pay while away from work is to ensure employees have the time they need to return to good health without the worry of lost pay.

""This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of March.""

Amazon has also established a $25m (£19.6m) fund to support independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants and seasonal employees ""under financial distress"".

BBC News has had access to an online forum used by about 25,000 Amazon warehouse workers.

And some of those unaffected by coronavirus are clearly relieved they will no longer have to struggle into work when either they or their family are sick.

""My two kids have been sick and last night I felt like death. Now, I can take time off and help the three of us to get better,"" wrote one.

Another said: ""It's allowing me to take a break and get my blood pressure down. My vision started to get blurry... my blood pressure was 176/100[mmHg].""

Those who test positive for the virus will now be guaranteed two weeks' pay.

And one Amazon warehouse worker told colleagues on the forum, the company's previous policy of not offering sick pay had been dangerous.

""Many co-workers live pay cheque to pay cheque and are still going to come into work even if they're sick, which means that coronavirus will spread like wildfire through Amazon, just like all the other sicknesses do,"" they wrote.

One in four US workers - more than 32 million - is not entitled to paid sick days and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics that rises to seven in 10 among low-paid workers.

And even before the coronavirus crisis, Amazon workers had begun to demand better conditions, with more paid time off (PTO) being chief among them.

In some facilities, workers have begun wearing badges saying: ""Amazonians united for PTO"".

""Amazon thinks we're just some stupid workers. But we know our rights, we're organising and we're winning,"" one worker, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51832894,BBC,Tech,True
322,"['Kevin Peachey', 'Personal Finance Reporter']",Is this the digital future for Bank of England banknotes?,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Digital money would be denominated in pounds, like banknotes

The Bank of England is considering the introduction of electronic banknotes for use by consumers and businesses.

Governor Mark Carney said: ""We are in the middle of a revolution in payments,"" saying the Bank must look into how electronic money could work.

He said this would complement, not replace, paper banknotes while people still wanted physical cash.

But it could open the door to programmable money to integrate with home appliances or the tax system.

Banknotes have been the only way for households to make payments with central bank money for 300 years, a discussion paper published by the Bank says.

The total value of banknotes in the UK economy was close to an all-time high, but people had been making fewer payments in cash, the Bank said.

The governor said fintech firms had begun to offer new forms of money and new ways to pay with it, but it was important to have currency from a trusted central bank.

So, the Bank is considering a Central Bank Digital Currency, which would be denominated in pounds sterling, just like banknotes. So £10 of the digital currency would always be worth the same as a £10 note.

This system would be different from money held digitally in a bank account, or cryptocurrencies. It would be guaranteed by the Bank, rather than a commercial business.

The idea also suggests that consumers would be able to pay for things without all the data about their transactions going to their bank. There would be some anonymity, as there is with cash.

Loading Central Bank Digital Currency would be an electronic version of withdrawing banknotes from an ATM. The Bank stressed this would not replace cash, particularly for those who prefer to use it.

""As long as demand for cash remains, the Bank is committed to meeting this demand,"" the Bank's discussion paper says.

The currency would also be separate from card payments, meaning it would not be affected by technical failures at Visa, Mastercard, or other payment networks.

Payments of the future

The introduction of a digital currency could lead to ""programmable money"", when payments could be integrated with appliances at home or tills at the shops.

Tax payments could be routed to HM Revenue and Customs at the point of sale, the Bank said.

Other examples are shares automatically paying dividends directly to shareholders, or electricity meters paying suppliers directly, based on the amount of power used.

It could also help with very small payments at a lower cost than now, allowing payments such as for a few pence each time to read individual news articles, rather than signing up to a monthly subscription.

Other central banks around the world are investigating the option of issuing digital currency. Interested parties are being invited to respond to the Bank of England's discussion by 12 June.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51851523,BBC,Tech,True

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced the 20% tax on e-books and online newspapers, magazines and journals will be abolished on 1 December.

But the BBC has learned that it will not apply to audiobooks, something that the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said was ""disappointing"".

A letter calling for the tax to be axed was signed by more than 600 authors and presented to Parliament in October.

Physical books and periodicals are already exempt.

In October 2018, the EU allowed member states drop sales taxes on electronic publications and many countries have already made the changes.

""The government expects the publishing industry, including e-booksellers, to pass on the benefit of this relief to consumers,"" the Budget states.

RNIB's head of social change, Sarah Lambert, said it was disappointing that the tax break was not being extended to audiobooks.

""Today's change recognises the unfairness of taxing some alternative formats and will help widen access for blind and partially sighted people who use e-Readers.

""However, for many people living with sight loss, audiobooks are their preferred format and allow them to enjoy their favourite titles in the same way as everyone else. It's not right that they will continue to be charged 20% more for books and we urge the government to make sure that audiobooks are included in the exemption.""

Publisher 404 Ink tweeted the ""huge"" decision would allow it to sell e-books from its website again.

Jim Waterson, media editor at the Guardian newspaper, estimated the move could benefit News UK - publisher of the Sun and Times papers - by £20m, if it kept the cost to consumers the same rather than passing on the saving to subscribers.

A 2018 report by the Publishers' Association estimated universities, libraries, government departments and the NHS would save up to £55m a year as a result of ditching VAT on digital publications.

In response to the news, it said: ""We are delighted that the government has decided to zero-rate VAT on digital books and journals in the Budget. It's fantastic that the Chancellor has acknowledged the value of reading.

""The decision to axe the reading tax will bring an end to the illogical and unfair tax on those who need or prefer to read digitally and should contribute to an increase in literacy in the UK.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51832899,BBC,Tech,True

The world's biggest gaming event, E3, has been cancelled over fears surrounding the spread of coronavirus.

The event, due to take place 9-11 June in Los Angeles, had been highly anticipated, ahead of PlayStation and Xbox console launches later this year.

Organisers said it had been cancelled ""after careful consultation"" over ""the health and safety of everyone in our industry"".

And they were ""exploring options"" for an ""online experience"" in June.

""This might lead to some permanent change to events like E3,"" said Piers Harding-Roll, from Ampere Analysis.

Such major expos ""were already struggling to define themselves in the rapidly changing landscape of games"" he said.

""Next year, E3 may well be quite different.""

The hype train derailed

Analysis by Marc Cieslak, gaming reporter

Got a new game to tell people about? Do it at E3. Got a new console to flog? E3 is the first stop the hype train calls at.

Over the course of its life, E3 has morphed from a trade-only event that helped retailers to figure how many physical copies of a game they wanted to buy, into a circus of organised chaos.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Monster Hunter photo booth in 2019 attracted plenty of attention

In recent years, the public has been allowed in, hoping to catch a glimpse of (or spend hours queuing to play) a pre-release game demo on the show floor. Multi-million dollar press conferences became the norm.

But industry observers have suggested that E3 has struggled to remain relevant in the last few years.

Opening up to the public was part of an attempt to regain some former glory. But the harsh reality is that E3 is an expensive show to exhibit at, costing many millions of dollars for those that do.

Some big brands would rather create their own events, promoting only their own products - a trend that doesn't look like it's going away any time soon.

Sony, which is launching its Playstation 5 console in time for the Christmas season, had already decided not to attend, for the second year in a row.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gamers play together on the show floor at E3 2019

Nintendo has also shifted to making its announcements in a global online live-stream - but, like many developers, it has maintained a presence at E3 for hands-on demonstrations.

Those are open to the public - and often involve game controllers being passed from person to person as thousands mingle on the show floor.

Microsoft's Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, tweeted that while the company had planned on appearing at E3, it would now hold a digital event.

Latest casualty

Dozens of major technology events have been cancelled in recent weeks as the virus has spread around the world and public health officials have warned people against gathering in large numbers.

The Game Developers Conference, SXSW, Mobile World Congress, and Google and Facebook's major conferences are among the casualties.

Major events that have yet to be cancelled include:

Bafta Games Awards: The British Academy awards ceremony, on 2 April, in London

The British Academy awards ceremony, on 2 April, in London WWDC: Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, on 3-7 June, in San Jose, California

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, on 3-7 June, in San Jose, California NAB: The annual broadcaster and media trade show, on 18-22 April, in Las Vegas,

Other events, such as the Ted talks series, have been postponed or shifted online.

'Upload demos'

The gaming media was left frustrated with organisers after the personal information of more than 2,000 journalists was published on E3's website last year.

And, on Wednesday, gaming journalist Laura Kate Dale tweeted: ""With last year's E3 scaring away press... many publishers [are] likely to learn this year how cost-effective live-streamed events can be.

""I wouldn't be shocked if we look back at 2020 as the year E3 died.""

Meanwhile, Brian Crecente, a former games journalist turned consultant, said: ""Why not have E3 without the E3?""

She set about creating a women's urinal. The simple seatless basin she devised is housed in a cubicle with roof and door, designed for faster use but also privacy. ""I was not a designer. I was a user first,"" says the 46-year-old.

Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

However, thanks to social media, and growing competition between event organisers, she thinks the issue is getting more attention.

""[It] forces them to offer better services,"" she explains. Also, organisers now realise, when women are queuing, they're not spending money.

Des Isnards says 100,000 women used madamePee last year, at 15 events across France, including the Women's World Cup. ""It fits all women, not only young ones open to innovation.""

Two units have been also been installed in Paris as public amenities, she says. This year the loo will be in several other countries.

""The ambition is very clear. It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,"" says the French entrepreneur.

Even newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.

Copenhagen-based architects, Gina Périer and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.

""It's just insanely more efficient,"" says Ms Périer, 25.

The idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival. ""I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,"" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. ""There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.""

Image copyright Eric Delafosse Image caption Lapee is 'insanely more efficient' say its creators

According to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate.

The team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.

Getting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. ""We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,"" she tells me.

Lapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.

Ms Périer says Lapee is also targeting, ""public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.""

The start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year.

They're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.

More Technology of Business

Other urinal products have launched with varying success.

Perhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up.

Sam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.

""The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,"" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further.

Mr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.

Gail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.

""It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,"" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.

""Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption Research suggests women take up to twice as long to use toilets

Women typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned.

""We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,"" Ms Ramster says.

""Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.""

Researchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times.

But the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women.

""For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,"" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. ""This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].""

It could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676,BBC,Tech,True

When I meet up with Jake Sweet (aka Surfaceldn on TikTok), he's buzzing.

He's about to be flown out to the MTV Video Music Awards in Spain as a special guest. Dinner will be laid on, he explains, and there will be aftershow parties where he will rub shoulders with music's biggest stars - but best of all, says the 21-year-old, he will hang out with other social media influencers he admires.

He got his invite because he has just over three million followers on the TikTok video sharing app (more than twice as many as pop star Dua Lipa). His presence at the event will boost its profile, as well as his own.

But once the party's over, it will be back to Earth with a bump. He will return to lectures at the University of Nottingham.

When not working towards his degree, Jake makes fun, craft-based videos on TikTok, with a sideline in pranking. For instance, he once surprised his brother by filling his duvet with popcorn.

But he's best known for customising trainers, and for his tricks with orbeez, colourful pellets that change size in water.

He started on TikTok just to have fun with his friends back in November 2018. His videos achieved tens of thousands of views almost immediately, so he threw himself into it.

Now meet Felicity Harfin (aka @refelicity) and her boys.

Image copyright Harfin Family Image caption The Harfin family Tiktok stars

Felicity lives in Edinburgh and works in marketing - or at least she used to.

She discovered TikTok last year and decided to make some fun videos. Things really took off when she included her two sons.

Over summer she did a ""prank-a-day"" marathon called ""Taking revenge on my kids"". This included pretending to trap her hand in a car door and tricking them into smearing baked beans on their faces.

Half-way through the series, her videos were consistently getting two million views, and one achieved 13 million.

She now has 1.8 million followers and TikToking has practically become her full-time job.

TikTok is a Chinese-owned social media app that allows you to share short videos. The international version of the app has more than one billion users. In 2019 it was the second-most downloaded app globally, after WhatsApp.

The platform is owned by ByteDance and morphed out of the lip-syncing app Musical.ly. Music remains an important part of the experience - posts can be set to snippets of the latest commercial releases.

What sets TikTok apart from other social media platforms is the way it finds videos for you. As well as seeing videos posted by friends, users are recommended videos by the company's software algorithm.

Unlike Facebook, which recommends content based on your friends' activity, TikTok delves deep into users' behaviour on the app to figure out their tastes. Make the right kind of content and you can potentially reach millions of eyeballs.

And this explains a big reason for TikTok's appeal. In theory anyone can become ""TikTok famous"" - you don't have be a reality-TV star, or celebrity sportsperson to make viral videos.

Add to the equation the app's hashtag challenges and the experience becomes like a talent show.

On established platforms like YouTube and Instagram, influencers have made millions through advertising revenue and paid promotions. So can everyday influencers who crack the TikTok code make money, considering its vast reach?

Image copyright other Image caption Jake filled his brother's duvet in one popular prank video

Jake earns a small but steady income from TikTok which helps him at university - it's enough for things like groceries. But most of the money he makes gets spent on props for his next videos, he says.

Doing several videos a day is time-consuming - even his 15-second videos can take up to an hour to record. He has to put in an ""extra shift"" to make sure his university studies don't suffer.

But he gets lifestyle perks like party invites, and the experience of being a social media celebrity.

""I do get some money through promotions,"" he explains. ""I've done work with people like Amazon Music, rappers Trippie Redd and Juice Wrld.""

""They say we need you to promote this song, by doing a video along these lines, and then I put my own creative interpretation into it.""

Image copyright Harfin Image caption A memorable Harfin family video involved pretending to trap Felicity's hand in a car door

Jake gets his paid work through a company called Fanbytes, one of the digital agencies which have sprung up to service influencers.

Well-known early agencies of this kind include OP Talent, set up in 2012, which signed gaming star KSI, and Gleam Futures, which snapped up YouTuber Zoe Sugg.

Timothy Armoo founded Fanbytes in 2017 with fellow computer scientists he met at university.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Timothy Armoo of Fanbytes explains how his success is grounded in a love of maths

The company is busy signing up Snapchat and TikTok users, with a focus on ""Gen Z"" and the 18-21 market. It uses in-house algorithms to predict whose followings are about to take off.

Its software also measures who can persuade their followers to click on links - this is known as ""conversion ability"".

After that, some old-fashioned human decision making comes into play.

""We want people who can deliver what we call 'advertainment'"", explains Armoo. This is a seamless mixture of fun and paid-for content, while maintaining what he describes as a ""boy- or girl-next-door quality"".

Armoo has hooked influencers up with brands like Deliveroo, but also the government, who wanted his help to spread the word about the national minimum wage to a BAME audience.

Image copyright other Image caption Shauni Kibby - known on Tiktok as @Itzshauni

Shauni gets recognised by young teenagers in the street all the time thanks to her work on TikTok, where she has 3.2 million followers.

She joined the app's predecessor, Musical.ly in 2016. Within five days her videos were getting 10,000 likes and she immediately saw the potential, she says.

You can see why her videos appeal to a young audience. Many are like playground games and include fun pranks, tricks to impress friends, dances, or skits about love and relationships.

TikTok now provides her with enough money to live on, plus the ability to indulge her habit of clothes shopping - but less than you might think, given the size of her fanbase.

Sara McCorquodale, who runs an influencer intelligence platform called CORQ which tracks TikTok trends, agrees the platform is a tricky financial proposition.

While she predicts that brands will be spending more money on it this year, the model for rewarding influencers will have to be different to YouTube or Instagram, because ""short-term trends dominate what is popular as much as individual personalities"".

""It's like the internet before Facebook, it's fast-moving and unpredictable.""

Image copyright other Image caption TikTok stars Shanae and Renae are launching a lip gloss product

TikTok is busy moving into the mainstream with an advertising campaign, and expanding its community management operation in London. It will have to manage its influencers' money-making activities more carefully as it gets more attention.

""If you make sponsored content you have to do it explicitly and if the brand or influencer doesn't, they can get sanctioned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA),"" says Ms McCorquodale. ""Even if you are wearing a piece of clothing that is a gift, that has to be made clear.""

Not all influencers on TikTok are following these rules at the moment, and Instagram influencers have recently been banned for being irresponsible and for not being up front about product promotion.

Image caption Sara McCorquodale runs a social media influencer intelligence agency

TikTok says that ""every video posted as an advertisement is reviewed by us to ensure it is compliant with the ASA guidelines"".

It also says it regularly shares the ASA guidelines with creators, and that if an influencer indicates a video is sponsored, it will automatically be posted with ""#ad"" displayed.

TikTok has fallen foul of influencer behaviour before. Last year it was forced to apologise for the way some stars exploited young fans for financial gain through ""digital gifts"", with influencers themselves calling for more guidance from the app.

TikTok's growing prominence has also seen it face closer scrutiny over issues that affect all social media platforms like user privacy and personal safety.

It was fined in the United States for holding data on children under 13 and more recently faced criticism for the meme known as the skull-breaker challenge.

Charities have also called for it to do more to prevent the grooming of young children.

Jake plans to complete his degree and then pursue a full-time career as a social media influencer, focusing on TikTok.

""I want this to be an occupation for me,"" he says. Meanwhile, he is simply enjoying the interesting opportunities it brings.

The student's next engagement is a party to celebrate the launch of a new shoe, which he will of course be TikToking about.

When one of Louise Halford's staff members returned from a ski trip with flu-like symptoms, she advised him to work from home rather than risk bringing the coronavirus into the office.

Ms Halford also decided to work from home after feeling some possible symptoms as well.

""We work with someone who has a compromised immune system, so I don't want to take any chances,"" says Ms Halford, co-founder of Manchester-based Evolve Family Law.

Around the world, millions of other people have also been told to stay at home in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19.

That includes Apple where the chief executive Tim Cook told staff, ""feel free to work remotely if your job allows"".

Amazon and Google have similar policies in place.

""Employers are definitely taking this seriously,"" says Hannah Ford, a partner and employment law expert at law firm Stevens & Bolton.

""We are advising lots of clients on crisis management plans.""

Fortunately, there are now a huge variety of tools and services available to help employees perform their roles effectively from home.

Keeping in touch

Communicating with colleagues is crucial, which is why remote meeting services are in high demand.

In China, up to 22 times as many people are using Cisco's Webex videoconferencing service since the coronavirus appeared.

Like several of its competitors, it has upgraded its free service in response to the surge in demand.

Anyone signing up to its 90-day free plan can therefore benefit from unlimited usage, while the maximum number of participants is now 100, up from 50.

Rival Zoom also has a free video-conferencing plan. Its free tier allows unlimited one-to-one meetings, as well as group sessions lasting up to 40 minutes and involving 100 participants.

More Technology of Business

Staying secure

Those new to working from home present a juicy target for hackers, who will no doubt sense an opportunity to steal sensitive information, or commit online fraud.

To keep information secure most companies will use a virtual private network (VPN) to create an encrypted connection from the user's computer to their company IT system.

However, even businesses with a quality VPN may need to buy more user licences or improve the server capacity for everyone to use it at once.

""Companies are increasingly stress-testing their servers to ensure they will cope with everyone working remotely,"" Ms Ford says.

Another option would be to control your work computer from home using remote desktop software.

You might even want to use both bits of tech, which would provide a secure way to access your work computer.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Check your internet connection before working from home

If you are going to work from home, you might want to check that your internet connection is reliable.

Self-employed accountant Elizabeth Stanley's advice for anyone who may have to self-isolate is therefore to ""get your internet connection and security sorted now"".

""It's worth checking your home broadband provider allows you to connect to a VPN as this varies between providers, packages, and areas,"" says Ms Stanley, who is based in Newport, South Wales.

If not, you may need to upgrade, or invest in a mobile hotspot or router.

Anyone who collaborates with colleagues in different locations has probably used documents shared over the internet.

Slack, for example, is a secure instant messaging platform that offers file sharing and video calls and wants ""to replace email"".

It has around ten million users, including Sam O'Connor, co-founder of London-based banking app Coconut.

""Slack is a really good way of keeping in touch with everyone when you are working remotely,"" he says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Slack hopes to replace email with its collaborative work software

Slack's advice for users forced into quarantine includes setting up an Announcements channel that is read-only for most people but that administrators and managers can use to post important information.

It also recommends using the app's custom statuses to let colleagues know when you are on a call or away from your desk, and sketching out ideas on paper before taking a photo with your phone - rather than spending time and energy creating a slide.

But Slack is just one of many such apps.

Other options include Microsoft's Teams platform.

Part of Office 365, Teams' free version supports up to 300 participants and offers guest access, one-on-one, and group video and audio calls, as well as file and screen sharing, and online document collaboration.

And for businesses requiring more services, Microsoft too has responded to the current epidemic by offering a free six-month trial of the paid version, including full meetings, collaboration and workflow capabilities.

Asana is a similar service, with 70,000 paying customers at the end of 2019.

328,"['Will Smale', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']",The tech boss who lost more than a billion,"Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption Andrew Rickman today runs Rockley Photonics, which specialises in designing and producing next-generation, optical computer chips

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to UK technology pioneer Andrew Rickman.

How would you feel if you lost more than £1.4bn ($1.81bn) almost overnight?

That was the situation faced by Andrew Rickman back at the end of 2000, when the dotcom bubble spectacularly burst, sending shares in his company Bookham Technology plummeting.

""It was like a nuclear winter,"" he says looking back.

Andrew had set up Bookham in 1988 in the kitchen of his home in Wiltshire, when he was 28. It grew to become one of the world's leading providers of optical components for the telecommunication and computer industries. In very simple terms, its technology allowed data to be transferred very quickly using lasers and glass fibres.

By the late 1990s its sales were booming as more and more homes and businesses were being connected to the internet, and mobile phone networks were being rolled out.

Image copyright Andrew Rickman Image caption Andrew says his previous wealth was widely reported in UK newspapers

The good times were, well, so good, that after Bookham floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in April 2000, within two months it had joined the FTSE 100 index. This is the list of the 100 firms on the exchange with the largest market capitalisation - the combined value of all their shares.

Such was the surge of Bookham's share price that Andrew, who owned the largest stake in the business, became the UK's first technology billionaire. This sent the UK's tabloid newspapers into a frenzy, and the softly spoken, modest 40-year-old was suddenly a reluctant celebrity.

Journalists excitedly told their readers that he was richer than Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Paul McCartney combined. Looking back, he says he was ""embarrassed"" by all the coverage.

At the peak of Bookham's share price in the summer of 2000, Andrew was worth more than £1.5bn. Then the dotcom bubble burst, and before the end of the year Bookham's share price - and Andrew's wealth - had collapsed.

This thrust him back into the papers, which now gleefully reported his downfall.

Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption He predicts that his latest company - Rockley Photonics - could see billions of pounds in annual sales

""I didn't think particularly much about all the press coverage,"" says Andrew, now 59. ""The money wasn't an issue, because it was only on paper. Being the first dotcom billionaire wasn't a reality to me.

""The thing that was difficult to deal with, as a human being, was the massive change of circumstances for the company and our technology. It was an emotionally difficult thing to handle for many different reasons.""

The big problem for Bookham was that its cutting-edge optical equipment was expensive. And after the dotcom bubble burst, its customers - the firms building all the new networks - switched to using cheaper, simpler technology instead.

But before you feel sorry for Andrew, he still had some £50m in his bank account, and he was able to slowly build Bookham back up again. This involved delisting from the LSE, and moving the company to Silicon Valley to get around the then high price of sterling, and be closer to key customers.

Andrew eventually left the business in 2004, to start a new career as a technology investor. Then in 2013 he started his latest business - Rockley Photonics.

Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption Andrew now employs a team which keeps a close eye on economic and industry trends

Based in Oxford, with a 150-strong workforce, it designs a product called silicon photonic chips. These are like standard microchips, but with one key difference - they beam light around the chip instead of sending an electronic current.

Although the photonic chip industry is still in its infancy, the advantage is said to be that they can process a lot more data, more quickly. Photonic chips are now increasingly being used in everything from data centres to sensor systems on autonomous cars, and in the latest mobile phones.

Andrew says that Rockley now has an annual turnover in the ""tens of millions"", but with the potential of increasing this to billions.

Veteran electronics journalist Peter Clarke says that Andrew ""is one of a group of UK engineering visionaries that also carry the entrepreneurial gene"".

""Rickman is smart in an intense, academic way, and a good advert for the UK higher education system."" (He was educated at Imperial College in London, and the University of Surrey.)

Looking back on the dotcom bust, does Andrew think he should have predicted it?

""Hindsight is a great thing,"" he says. ""I don't think many people were prepared for that sort of boom and bust, they never seem to be.

""The span of time between boom and busts tends to be sufficient for the collective knowledge to have gone into retirement. But we were one of very, very, very few firms in our area that survived.

""One thing I did learn at that time was to have an eye to a more analytical view of the world around us. So from that point on I've always had what I would describe as an analysis team...

329,"['Lucy Proctor', 'Bbc Stories']",'My search for the boy in a child abuse video',"One day, just after I had dropped my son off at school, I was sent a horrific video on WhatsApp. It made me question how images and videos of child sex abuse come to be made, and how they can be openly circulated on social media. And I wanted one answer above all - what happened to the boy in the video?

It may sound strange, but the woman who sent me the video was a fellow mum at the school gates. A group of us had set up a WhatsApp group to discuss term dates, uniforms, illnesses.

Then one morning, out of the blue, one of these mums sent a video to the group, with two crying-face emojis underneath it.

It was just a black box, no thumbnail, and we all pressed play without thinking. Maybe it would be a meme or a news story. Maybe one of the ""stranger danger"" videos some of the mums had started to share.

The video starts with a shot of a man and a baby, about 18 months old, sitting on a sofa. The baby smiles at the man.

I can't describe the rest.

If I tell you what I saw in the 10 seconds it took to grasp what was happening, and press stop, you'll have the image in your head too. And you don't want it. It's a video of child sex abuse. It's nine minutes long.

I screamed, and threw my phone across the room. It was pinging with messages from distraught members of the group.

I took my phone to the police station. I told them what had happened. I told them I believed the woman had sent it to us as a warning, and that I hoped they would investigate where the video came from. Was it new, or one they'd already come across? Was this little boy still in danger? Could this evidence help save him, or catch the abuser?

The police had my phone for two weeks. I found out the next day that they arrested the woman who sent it and visited other members of the group. And then I didn't hear anything else about it.

But one question stayed with me. What happened to the boy in the video? And so, a few months later, once I could read my own kids a bedtime story without thinking of him and life had got back to normal, I began to look for answers.

I started by trying to speak to the police officer investigating the video on my phone. But every time I called Wembley CID to speak to him, he'd just gone out.

He didn't want anything to do with me.

I checked with Alan Collins, a lawyer who specialises in child sex abuse, to see if any of the things I might normally do to track down people would work. Could I, for example, send former police officers a copy of the video to see if they recognised it?

""You could be looking at a prison sentence of 10 years,"" he told me. Same goes for taking a still and sending that. Just possessing an image like this on my phone could land me in jail.

So I called a friend of a friend who used to work for the police. He told me Wembley CID would have sent my phone off to one of the digital forensics labs spread across the city. The labs list all the illegal content, and when it's child sex abuse they grade it: Category A for the most serious, Cat B, Cat C. This WhatsApp video was Cat A.

Next, the file goes to victim identification and my case was passed to the Metropolitan Police's Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Command. An officer there, Det Sgt Lindsay Dick, agreed to talk to me, but he didn't want to say much about the techniques used in case it helped offenders work out how to evade capture.

An estimated 100,000 men in the UK regularly view child sex abuse

Police arrest between 400 and 450 people a month, men mostly, for viewing or downloading these files

WhatsApp takes down 250,000 accounts every month suspected of spreading child sex abuse material, based on the names of groups and profile pictures

He did tell me about one case, where an officer had got hold of a phone that had images of a boy being abused on it, along with images of the same boy not being abused. In one, he's standing at a bus stop in school uniform. An officer recognised the bus stop as a Mersey Transport sign, and put a call in to the Merseyside team. They recognised the school uniform. The boy was identified, his parents arrested, and social services took over. Victim-identification police all over the world rely on little clues like this.

Lindsay Dick wouldn't discuss the details of what I'd been sent, even though he had investigated the case. Then, when I asked him about a suggestion from an editor to take a still from the video of the perpetrator's face, to help identify him, I started to feel some heat.

""Do you still have a copy of that video?"" he asked me, sternly. ""No,"" I replied. But it was still sitting somewhere on WhatsApp's server, and because I was still a member of the group, it was still showing on my phone. Even though I'd done nothing wrong, I realised how seriously the police took this kind of thing.

This hit home late last year when a senior Metropolitan Police officer, Supt Novlett Robyn Williams, was given 200 community hours' unpaid work and threatened with losing her job for failing to report a video of child sex abuse her sister had sent her on WhatsApp. (She is now appealing against the conviction.)

The Metropolitan Police refused to help me any further in my search for the boy in the video. At one point they even told officers in another part of the country, incorrectly, that I'd been cautioned for sharing the video.

I found out later from the woman who sent the video to me that she had been given three years on the sex offenders register. But the investigating officers at Wembley CID took the case no further - they didn't arrest the friend who had sent it to her, and they didn't even try to find out who had sent it to her friend. Further up that chain of people sharing the video must be some dangerous people, perhaps an abuser. But nothing was done to follow the trail.

The Metropolitan Police says: ""The scale of child abuse and sexual exploitation offending online has grown in recent years. This increased demand on police, coupled with the need to keep up with advancement of technology and adapt our methods to detect and identify offenders, means it is a challenging area for the Met and police forces nationally. However, we remain committed to bringing those who commit child abuse offences online to justice, and safeguarding victims and young people at risk.

""We encourage anyone concerned about a child at risk of abuse or a possible victim, to contact police immediately. Anyone who receives an unsolicited message which depicts child abuse should report it to police immediately so action can be taken. Images of this nature should not be shared under any circumstances.""

I needed someone who wasn't involved with the case to give me some more clues about where this file I'd been sent might have come from. So I started searching, and I came across news articles about a team in Queensland, Australia with a reputation for infiltrating child abuse video-sharing sites.

Their head of victim identification, former Greater Manchester Police detective Paul Griffiths, told me the file I'd been sent had probably started life on one of these sites.

""What tends to happen is that when a file gets produced like that, it generally stays under cover, under wraps, circulating amongst a fairly small, tight network. Very often people who would know that they need to keep it safe and not distribute it widely,"" he said.

These networks of paedophiles use the dark web, a part of the internet that isn't indexed readily by search engines such as Google. They access sites through a connection called TOR, or the onion router. They use a fake IP address, connected to several other servers dotted around the globe, which makes their location untraceable.

Members of these dark web sites are like sick stamp collectors - they post thumbnails of what they have on dedicated online forums, and look to complete series, usually of a particular child.

Some of them are ""producers"" - they abuse the children, or film them being abused.

A couple of years ago Paul Griffiths' team was watching one site called Child's Play. They had intelligence that two of the site's leaders were meeting up in the US. Officers intercepted them, arrested them, and got their passwords.

Now they could see everything - each and every video - and they could get to work finding children and perpetrators. They made hundreds of arrests worldwide, and 200 children have been saved so far.

""It's Sherlock Holmes stuff, it's following little clues and seeing what you can piece together to try and find a needle in a haystack,"" says Griffiths.

The big worry now is live-streaming, where adults can pay to watch children being abused in real time. It's even harder to detect, because no file containing clues circulates, and the platforms are all encrypted. Just as the police and technology get better at finding victims in stills or videos, another threat emerges.

""There's a famous story and it often gets told in relation to this area of crime, in relation to the young girl walking on the beach and there's starfish all over the beach and she's picking the starfish up and putting them back into the sea and a guy says to her, 'Little girl, what are you doing? You're never gonna be able to save all of these starfish.' And she says, 'No, but I'll save that one.' And that's really what we're doing,"" says Griffiths.

""You know, we're saving the ones we can save. And if some magical solution appears somewhere in the future that's going to save all of them, that's going to stop this happening, then that'll be wonderful. But in the meantime, we can't just sit back and ignore what we know is happening.""

Paul Griffiths is part of a small network of people who travel the globe for meetings and conferences on what to do about the huge numbers of videos and images circulating online.

He told me to contact Maggie Brennan, a lecturer in clinical forensic psychology at the University of Plymouth, who has been studying child-sex-abuse material for years. Between 2016 and 2018 she combed through the child-abuse images in a database run by Interpol, to build up a profile of victims.

She found a chilling pattern that suggested the age of the boy in the video I saw is not that unusual.

""Concerningly, there is a substantive, small, but important proportion of those images that do depict infants and toddlers. And we found a significant result in terms of the association between very extreme forms of sexual violence and very young children.""

Like the boy in the video I was sent, most children on the database are white - most likely a reflection of the fact that the police forces contributing to it are from majority-white countries.

There's constant pressure, Brennan says, to quantify the numbers of images or videos that are in existence, and the numbers of victims who are being sexually exploited. But it's impossible. Databases only hold the images that have been found, through police raids or reports. Who knows how many are circulating out there?

Paul Griffiths says it only takes one person to bring a video out of the depths of the dark web and unleash it on the general population.

""Sooner or later it comes into the possession of someone who either doesn't know how to keep it safe and hidden, or doesn't really care. And they spread it wider. It can take a few hours, and it's all over the internet.""

I spoke to one offender who served seven months in prison for viewing child abuse images. He had been offered the files on Skype during an adult online sexual meet-up. He'd opened the first file, seen it was of a child - and carried on opening all 20. Then he tried to share them with someone else. Eventually, the man who sent him the files sent them to someone who told the police. But it's a telling example of how easily files like the one I was sent spread, from the depths of the dark web, on to platforms like Skype, and then to people's phones.

Despite the lack of action taken on my case, the UK policing response to child sex abuse images is one of the most robust in the world.

The Child Abuse Image Database (CAID) has seen huge investment over the last five years. When detectives receive the phone or laptop of a suspect, they can run images on it through state-of-the-art software that checks whether images are new, or already known to police. All police forces are linked up, and the database talks to others around the world.

In the 1990s the Home Office undertook a study of the proliferation of indecent imagery of children. There were less than 10,000 images in circulation then. Now there are almost 14 million images on the UK database.

The levels of depravity in videos and images are getting worse, Chief Constable Simon Bailey tells me. He's been the National Police Chief Council's lead for child protection and abuse investigations for the last five years.

I am expecting a forbidding character when I go to interview him at his Norfolk HQ. What I find is a man at the end of his tether.

""It just keeps growing, and growing, and growing,"" he says. ""And there is an element of, 'These figures are just so huge that just can't be right.' Well trust me, it is right. And if I have one really significant regret around my leadership and our response to this it's that we have struggled to land with the public the true scale of what we are dealing with, the horrors of what we are dealing with. Most people, I would like to think, would be mortified that this type of abuse is taking place.""

Last year, Simon Bailey called for a boycott of tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, until they invest in technology to filter and block these images and videos. The public, including myself, took little notice.

Last year, the robots Facebook deploys to sift through its Messenger service reported 12 million posts containing images of child abuse to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which runs the US database.

So child protection campaigners are horrified at Facebook's decision to start encrypting Messenger over the coming months, because it will mean the platform effectively goes ""dark"" and abusers will be able to share material with impunity.

It will become more like WhatsApp, where end-to-end encryption means no-one except the sender and receiver knows anything about what's in a message.

WhatsApp's encryption works because your phone and the phone of the person you're messaging generate the encryption codes and keys. When the message leaves your phone, it does travel through WhatsApp's servers - but they don't have the keys to decrypt it. The only way robots or artificial intelligence could scan the message would be if it was encrypted after it left your phone. But that would give prying regimes, law enforcement or the tech firms themselves a window into our messages. WhatsApp thinks it would lose customers as a result.

The solution is to do the scanning on our phones.

One way this could be done would be for everyone to download software with a list of all the unique codes of all the known child abuse images and videos. But this would still raise privacy concerns. The tech firms could fiddle with the list of codes to include non-child-abuse images - censorship in other words.

So it would be better if phones could run an algorithm to generate the codes themselves, completely independently from any government or tech company. This is the tricky bit though. No one's invented that algorithm yet.

One expert I spoke to put it like this: ""I wouldn't call it impossible, I'd call it unknown how to do it today."" It would take huge amounts of research and development - but it could probably be done.

The failure by Big Tech to invest in this angers Simon Bailey.

""They hold the key to so much of this. Their duty of care I think to children, they have completely absolved themselves of that.

""The reaction is always, 'Well we're doing our best.' No you're not. You need to do more. You're making billions of pounds in profit. Invest.""

There are high hopes for the UK government's Online Harms White Paper published in April 2019 - a radical proposal for legislation that would see tech firms held responsible for the harm they do. It proposes a new regulator and campaigners hope the resulting bill will include mandatory reporting of any child sex abuse. The results of a public consultation are due soon.

At the moment, the tech firms choose what to tell us. No-one knows, for example, how much Facebook or WhatsApp spend on child protection. Facebook says it has the best artificial intelligence on the market trying to block and filter messages. But the company won't reveal how it works, or how much it costs.

John Carr, who advises governments on child safety online, says this lack of transparency has to end.

""I work with people in these companies all the time, they agree with me on most stuff, they care passionately about protecting children but they don't make the decisions. It's their bosses, typically in California, that decide what happens. People high up in those companies need to feel the heat, they need to feel that their feet are being brought to the fire.""

Of course, I ask to speak to WhatsApp. They say no.

One bright summer day, I finally get a breakthrough in my search for the boy in the video. Simon Bailey's assistant puts me in touch with a senior police officer who opens some doors, and I get a call.

I'm told the boy is alive. He's one of the lucky minority who have been identified and rescued.

The video I was sent is an old one, from America. There are already three versions of it on the UK's CAID database - mine makes it four. Police can't tell me where he is, or what his name is. But they do tell me his abuser is serving a long jail term. It's the news I was hoping for.

And I'm happy to leave it at that. There's one word that has stuck in mind over the months that I've tried to find out more about this case - ""revictimisation"". Each time anybody watches or shares a video of a child being abused, that child is revictimised. And as I get closer to finding the boy, I realise I could end up making a phone call to tell him, out of the blue, that I've seen the video of him. He'd be reminded of the horror. He'd be humiliated. I should just leave him in peace.

But I've learned about a campaign group in the US made up of victims - people filmed by abusers - who want to be found, and heard.

James Marsh, a lawyer who has been representing and campaigning for victims of child sex abuse for 14 years, recently spearheaded a change to the law in America that gives victims a right to a minimum of $3,000 compensation from everyone convicted of viewing or sharing a video of their abuse.

It's called the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018, after the three young victims who backed it by writing impact statements for the courts.

""It's only been really very recently that victims have become more empowered to reclaim that space, really trying to assert that this is not a victimless crime, that these are not harmless pictures, and that they have voices that deserve to be heard,"" he tells me.

Voluntary principles

A set of ""voluntary principles"" for the tech industry, designed to counter online child sexual exploitation and abuse was published this week by the governments of the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, after consultations with six leading tech companies.

An accompanying letter acknowledged the industry's efforts, but said there was ""much more to be done to strengthen existing efforts"". It added that the initiative was intended to ""drive collective action"".

The principles include preventing dissemination of child sex abuse material, targeting online grooming, preventing search results from surfacing child sexual abuse, and sharing data about the evolving threat.

Recently a seasoned journalist called him for details about what happened to one of his clients. She was expecting to hear that the abuse involved naked photos. When he told her of the reality of the content of these films - the rape of a small child - she was horrified, and didn't publish the details.

""I think as a journalist you're turning off your readership by including these graphic descriptions. And yet, how else can you accurately report what's happening to bring about meaningful change?""

He says his clients, as they get older, have become frustrated by this squeamishness. ""This is our lived experience,"" they say. ""Face up to it.""

I ask him if he thinks the young man, Andy, from the Amy and Vicky and Andy Act, would be up for talking to me. He agrees to connect us on Facebook Messenger.

And with that, I had found a boy in a video. One who had suffered the same terrible fate as the boy in the video I was sent.

Whatever I might have wanted to ask that boy, I could ask Andy. Did he have somewhere safe to sleep at night? Had he managed to stay safe?

Andy has a warm voice. He's eager to talk, candid and hugely likeable. It's strange, but our conversation is not a miserable one.

He tells me he is in his early 20s. He's been out of jail for six months, which is the longest he's managed since he was a child. Fighting mainly, and robbery. When he was younger he was into drugs - meth, heroin and weed. He's doing well at staying off them now. And he has two children, who he adores.

But he lives in a kind of prison.

""I'm kind of a boring person. I don't really go out much, I stay at home, I kind of live just with my kids, and that's about it.""

Andy lives in constant fear that someone might recognise him from one of the videos his abuser made of him, as the abuse continued until he was 13. If someone so much as looks at him in the street, he worries.

His story starts with his parents' divorce. His mother wanted a male figure in his life, and so when Andy was around seven years old she sent him to a youth programme. The ""mentor"" allocated by the organisation groomed Andy and his family for a few months and took Andy on trips to Las Vegas.

Andy didn't tell anyone when the sexual abuse started, because he didn't want to upset his mother.

""I didn't know how my mom would act about it. I didn't want her to be embarrassed because something had happened to me. I didn't know if it was normal. That's kind of how he made it seem.""

How to get help

If you've been affected by the issues touched on in this story, you can find sources of support on the BBC Action Line

The Lucy Faithfull Foundation works to prevent and tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation

When Andy grew old enough he confronted his abuser, who soon afterwards went on the run to Mexico. Then, one day, the FBI turned up at Andy's high school and knocked on his classroom door. The abuser had got sloppy - he'd sent a video to someone he didn't know, who'd reported him.

""And then they tell me that there's hundreds of thousands of videos and pictures of me out on the web.""

Until that moment, Andy had no idea his abuse had been shared at all, let alone with thousands of people. But despite this shocking news, and the difficulty of telling his mother the truth, Andy agreed to help the FBI lure his abuser back across the border.

""We coaxed him back with a birthday party of mine.

""It was a whole three months, all the way up until my birthday. I talked with him on the phone, like nothing was wrong. He sent me a few packages.""

The FBI officers set up the sting. They showed Andy the route they thought his abuser would take and the location of the planned arrest.

""It was really cool. They caught him a couple blocks from my grandmother's house, pulled him over and arrested him.""

It was one of the best moments of Andy's life.

Like other identified victims in the US, Andy gets a letter every time someone is convicted of viewing or sharing a video of him. He has thousands of them.

He's doing his best to rebuild his life. When he can afford therapy, things are better. His lawyers are working on some big cases, which should bring him more compensation. But it's tough.

""Work is really hard for me. And it's not because I'm lazy or anything. It's mainly the mentality of not being able to trust somebody. I can't let this person in. So I'm really anti-social.""

Andy, like all victims, was incredibly unlucky to fall into the hands of an abuser. Had he not, he thinks he would by now have been the CEO of his father's business.

He is finding purpose and solace in his involvement with Amy, Vicky and Andy's law. The three young campaigners hope to meet up in person soon. In the future, Andy wants to give up his anonymity and go into schools to teach children how to stay safe, and how to tell someone if they are not. He feels an obligation to do it he says.

""You know, I want people to know my story.""

I will never get to talk to the other boy in the video. I hope he's OK. I hope he can rebuild his life - however slowly and imperfectly - like Andy.

I've been able to give you a happy ending. Both Andy and the little boy in the video I was sent have been identified and their abusers are in prison. But this is wildly misleading.

Most of the boys and girls in videos won't be rescued. And without radical reform of the way we manage technology and privacy, videos like the one I saw will keep circulating, and new children will be abused to feed the demand.

330,"['Chris Baraniuk', 'Technology Of Business Reporter']",Electric cars are coming: but where will you recharge?,"Image copyright Tiffany Snowden Image caption The Snowdens can't always charge their car outside their house

They've got the only electric car in the village. Tiffany Snowden and her husband bought their second-hand Nissan Leaf a few weeks ago and love it. It's smooth to drive and, she says, ""It's got quite a lot of power to it"". But there's a problem. It's a pain to charge up.

That's because, in the North Yorkshire hamlet where they live, it's a race home every night to get a parking space outside their house. If they succeed, they can plug the car in to mains electricity overnight. If they fail, the options are limited.

""The closest charging point to us is about 10 miles away,"" says Mrs Snowden.

This is a dilemma that could face an increasing number of drivers. The government says that in just 15 years the only new cars on the market will be fully electric vehicles (EVs) or hydrogen-powered alternatives.

While the number of charging points around the UK has increased by about 50% in the last 12 months, according to statistics from EV charging site Zap-Map.com, there are noticeable gaps in provision around the country.

A recent report from Capital Economics suggested that fleshing out the UK's charging network will cost £45.9bn between now and 2050. There are even fears that the electricity grid won't be able to cope as thousands more EVs get plugged in by their new owners.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of charging points has risen by 50% over last 12 months

Is the UK ready for the electric vehicle revolution, then, or is the whole movement doomed to stall?

The Snowdens are hoping that their local charging problem will have a local solution. The government has allocated £5 million in funding for councils to spend on residential charging points.

However, when Mrs Snowden asked her council about this, a representative told her there was little space in the village for charging bays. Plus, they added that the expense of upgrading infrastructure for such facilities was significant. Improving cabling and substations alone could cost ""upwards of £75,000"", they said.

The representative advised Mrs Snowden to ask whether the local pub could install a charging point instead - because it has parking space available and, potentially, spare electricity.

In the meantime, the Snowdens intend to upgrade their home charging point and will have to carefully plan where they charge up and how they use the roughly 80 miles of range they get with their 2014 Nissan Leaf.

""I think we've kind of gone about it perhaps a bit backwards in getting the car first,"" she jokes. ""We kind of jumped a bit into it but I think we just have to face it now, really.""

More Technology of Business

For anyone else wondering where they might charge up a new EV, there are an increasing options, says Ben Lane, co-founder at Zap-Map.com.

""At current rates, we're essentially doubling the number of charge points in the UK over a two year period,"" he says. Around 10,000 individual charging connectors were installed in the last 12 months in the UK. However, Dr Lane adds that there are places where gaps in the network are apparent.

""Wales is the country in the United Kingdom that probably needs to do the biggest catch-up,"" he says. And while England has by far the most chargers, there are places where coverage is ""fragmented"".

Certainly, some EV users have not faced the same challenges as the Snowdens in North Yorkshire.

Richard Jackson and his wife bought their first EV, a BMW i3, as an experiment back in 2016.

""We ended up using the BMW for everything,"" he says. ""It very quickly became our main family car.""

Image copyright Virtronix Image caption The Jacksons and their electric cars

Mr Jackson, who used to work in the petrol sector, commutes into London from his home near Hatfield and says that one of his main motivations for buying an electric car was to play a part in reducing ambient pollution in the capital.

""I really could tell, 'Wow, the air is not as good as it is out in the sticks'. I wanted to see… could I make a difference?"" he explains.

He's since bought a second electric car, an MG ZS EV, and hasn't looked back. Planning when and where to charge on journeys is important, Mr Jackson says, but he's taken his car to France on family holidays without problems. Since he began driving an electric vehicle, he has come close to running out of electricity on only one occasion, he says.

However, he does add that while he saves money on petrol, charging the car when out and about does incur other costs: ""My goodness me, you buy a lot of coffees when you go into charge points.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption BP owns the Chargemaster network of charging stations

Most of the charging bays being installed at the moment are being paid for by private businesses - including electricity companies, car makers and firms, like BP for instance, that also run petrol stations. Chargers might be located at service stations or hotels, leisure centres and shopping complexes, for example.

In some cases, these facilities are free to use but most charge a fee or a monthly subscription. There are also important differences to watch out for - charging times will vary widely depending on whether you plug in to a slow, fast or rapid charger.

More than £1.5bn will need to be spent on public charging infrastructure by 2030, according to accountancy firm Deloitte. There are huge costs in terms of supplying cabling and substations as well as the charging points themselves, say Deloitte's Jamie Hamilton and Michael Woodward.

Dr Lane at Zap-Map.com estimates that the UK's chargers will need to be used on average around five times as often as they are today before the system is financially sustainable. Investing in the network now, though, is essential.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many electric cars, including Audi's e-tron promise more than 200 miles between charges

As Mr Hamilton says, ""Lack of charging infrastructure is the number one barrier to people in terms of buying EVs at the moment."" That's become the top concern, having overtaken price and range, according to Deloitte's market research. Some new cars on sale today, including the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Audi e-tron, have more than 200 miles in range.

Even if the number of charging points around the UK does boom, some question whether the electricity grid will be able to cope with thousands of new vehicles thirsty for power.

A National Grid spokeswoman told the BBC that the anticipated increase of in electricity demand of 10% that is expected from EVs is ""entirely manageable"" because peak demand has fallen by 16% in the UK since 2002, due to efficiency gains. However, she adds that the system will still need to ensure everyone isn't plugging in their electric car at once.

This means connecting up charging points to a computer system that determines when they can be used. Currently, private individuals' car-charging habits are difficult to monitor and control.

The government has plans to bring in a new law that would ensure every new home built in the UK has an EV charging point. Some housing developments are already ploughing ahead with this idea.

Pedro Pacheco at market analysts Gartner praises this approach and says that, ultimately, drivers will have to be able to easily charge their cars at home or at work - with minimal change to their daily routines.

""In the end, this is absolutely essential for the acceptance of EVs,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51678830,BBC,Tech,True
331,,Coronavirus: More universities halt teaching and exams,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Face-to-face lectures are being suspended at many universities

Salford, Bristol, Edinburgh, Nottingham and Southampton universities are among the latest to rearrange teaching and exams to limit the spread of Covid-19.

Measures include ending term early, online teaching and cancelling exams.

The moves came as six Oxford students were diagnosed with the virus, while St Andrew's and Bristol universities have each reported a case.

""I recognise many of you are understandably anxious,"" Nottingham's vice-chancellor told students.

Prof Shearer West said in a letter, which she asked students to share with friends and family: ""I am writing to let you know what measures we are taking immediately to reassure you, protect your health and ensure that your learning can continue.""

Nottingham will put all teaching online from 23 March and is cancelling all trips overseas and residential trips within the UK.

However, the letter stresses the university - including its libraries - will remain open.

Salford University has announced all teaching - except for final-year students - will be suspended from Monday, but the campus and student accommodation will remain open.

""This will give us time and space to plan for what may be necessary,"" said a spokesperson.

Edinburgh is also transferring teaching online. Exams are cancelled for first- and second-year students, with those in their third year and beyond taking them online.

Again, the university stressed it was still open, with libraries, counselling, research and study spaces operating as usual.

""Students should be assured that they will achieve their qualifications on time and an Edinburgh degree will still hold the same value,"" said a spokesperson.

The University of West of Scotland has asked students not to attend its campuses from Monday, although it, too, says it will remain open.

It intends to move to remote learning ""to reduce the number of individuals on campus at any one time"".

Early holidays

Meanwhile, the University of Southampton has decided to bring its spring holiday forward by a week so that term now ends on 13 March.

""We will keep any impact to the absolute minimum and ensure all students can successfully complete their term's learning,"" it said in a statement.

Summer term is scheduled to start as normal next month.

Image caption Even if teaching and exams are off, libraries will remain open, say universities

In a similar move, the University of Bristol has announced it will end face-to-face teaching earlier this term, on 18 March. Online teaching will begin after the holidays and all overseas fieldtrips are cancelled.

Bristol vice-chancellor Hugh Brady, said he believed the measures were ""balanced and proportionate"".

""This is indeed a very worrying time for us all - professionally and personally - but I am confident that we can harness our collective ingenuity, resolve and passion for our institution to navigate the choppy waters ahead,"" he said.

'Business as usual'

Across the city, University of West of England took a different approach, tweeting: ""It is currently business as usual here but please rest assured we're monitoring the situation very closely and are able to act quickly if it changes to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our students, staff and visitors.""

A number of universities had previously announced moves to online teaching, including Durham, Manchester Metropolitan, the London School of Economics and Loughborough, where one student has tested positive for the virus.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51880355,BBC,Education,True
332,,Coronavirus: Government insists schools should stay open,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption There are real worries over the impact the virus will have on learning

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said keeping schools open in England is the ""best course of action"", despite fears about the coronavirus.

It comes as blanket school closures are being announced in European nations such as Spain, France and Ireland.

He told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that sending all pupils home would put a big strain on key workers who would also have to stay at home.

School leaders agreed keeping schools open was the right decision.

Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which is meeting for its annual conference, said head teachers would authorise absence if parents took the decision to keep their children off lessons.

'Exams worry'

He anticipated absences would be small in scale and similar to ""snow days"".

The government has said individual schools may be advised to shut by Public Health England if necessary.

Mr Barton said there was pressure from parents for more information and guidance about what might happen to national exams.

The exam season starts in early May, when the virus outbreak is expected to reach its peak, but exam regulators are urging schools to prepare for public exams as normal.

GCSE exams start in the second week of May and run until mid-June.

Mr Barton said many head teachers were facing questions about the exam season, and there was an urgent need for reassurance.

""Parents and pupils are worried about being the victim of something out of their control and are asking, 'Will I get into college or university?'""

Mr Williamson said: ""We're doing everything we can to make sure it's fair for students, we're having regular discussions with Ofqual.""

The government warned on Thursday that within weeks, whole households would be asked to self-isolate if one person showed symptoms consistent with coronavirus.

It is not clear exactly what this would mean for a teenager unable to sit their exams, but there are mechanisms for allocating marks in exceptional circumstances, which have been used before.

The Welsh government has been advised that school closures are not an appropriate move at the moment, though the situation remains under review.

The Scottish government has also said school closures would not be an effective measure at this stage.

The Republic of Ireland's decision to close schools, colleges and public childcare facilities until 29 March is likely to affect businesses in Northern Ireland's border region that employ staff from the Irish Republic.

In the meantime, many schools will continue to assess how technology could be used to continue pupils' learning in the event of isolated closures.

Sharon Bruton, chief executive of the Keys Federation Academy Trust in Wigan, whose schools use an artificial-intelligence learning platform, said teachers could set assignments via email and social media accounts.

""Schools are adaptable and flexible places - I'm certain school leaders and curriculum leaders will be thinking about how teaching can continue for their students should this be an eventuality,"" she said.

""Educators are remarkably resilient and adaptable and I think part of our job is to meet the needs of our children and make sure they can thrive in challenging circumstances - and this [coronavirus outbreak] won't be any different.""

So the possibility of blanket school closures has been kicked down the road, but that doesn't remove the uncertainty entirely.

No head teacher can rule out the possibility their school could be affected at some point. More pressing is the likelihood that the peak in cases could coincide with exams due to begin in mid-May.

This might mean more households isolating, more teachers off work.

One option could be to move some exams to later in June, when fewer are traditionally scheduled to take place.

This would prolong the agony for teenagers, and their families, but could increase the chances of most being able to sit the exams that are the passport to the next stage of their life.

In the meantime, despite expert advice, some parents continue to call for school closures.

The exams watchdogs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all urging teachers and students to prepare for the exams season as normal.

In Scotland, where exams start earlier than the rest of the UK, the Scottish Qualifications Authority said there was no change to the 2020 national-qualifications timetable.

""Current deadlines for coursework, and other assessments, remain in place,"" it added.

England's exams watchdog, Ofqual, said: ""We continue to work closely with exam boards, other regulators and the Department for Education and we have met to plan for a range of scenarios, as the public would expect.

""Our overriding priorities are fairness to students this summer and keeping disruption to a minimum.""

Qualifications Wales said: ""We will provide guidance on our website to reflect any specific arrangements that schools and colleges should put in place if required.""

Northern Ireland's Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) said there were ""a broad range of contingencies to ensure the smooth operation of examinations"", which would be updated if necessary.

335,,Coronavirus: Republic of Ireland to close schools and colleges,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar announced the measures on Thursday morning

Schools, colleges and other public facilities in the Republic of Ireland are to close in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said the measures take effect from 18:00 on Thursday until 29 March.

He said that Northern Ireland and the UK would be briefed on developments.

Some 27 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Ireland on Thursday, according to the Department of Health.

There are now 70 total confirmed cases in the country.

The first death linked to coronavirus in Ireland - involving an elderly woman with underlying health conditions - was announced on Wednesday.

Meanwhile two more people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 10.

There are now 596 confirmed cases in the UK.

On Thursday another two more cases were diagnosed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total to 20.

Making the announcement, Mr Varadkar added that indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 500 should be cancelled. He said people should work remotely if possible. Airports and ports will remain open.

Northern Ireland's schools and colleges will not close at this stage. First Minister Arlene Foster said NI would follow scientific advice.

Ireland's chief medical officer Tony Holohan said ""he recognises the differences"" on the island of Ireland in the way governments are dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak.

Mr Holohan said: ""We have assessed the situation from our point of view and we believe that closing schools is an important part of the strategy for the reasons of ultimately protecting older and vulnerable people from schoolchildren who may not be significantly affected in terms of the illness.""

Earlier on Thursday, stocks tumbled around the world after US President Donald Trump restricted travel to the US from mainland Europe in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The UK and Ireland were not included.

Mr Trump announced a ban on travellers from 26 European countries entering the United States for 30 days, starting on Friday.

Mr Varadkar said schools, colleges and childcare facilities will close from Friday and that the public and businesses needed to take a sensible approach.

The measures introduced in the Republic of Ireland will have a significant impact on Northern Ireland's border region, according to the managing director of O'Neill's sportswear firm.

It employs more than 750 staff at its factory in Strabane, County Tyrone, near the border with County Donegal in the Republic.

Kieran Kennedy said: ""That will be very challenging for a lot of our staff. It will have a real impact on our manufacturing.""

The taoiseach said he realised the restrictions would be a ""real shock"".

""It is going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives and I know I'm asking people to make enormous sacrifices but we're doing it for each other,"" Mr Varadkar said.

""Our economy will suffer but it will bounce back.

""Lost time in school or college will be recovered and in time our lives will go back to normal.

""Ireland is a great nation, we're great people, we've experienced hardship and struggle before, we've overcome many trials in the past.""

Mr Varadkar said shops should remain open and public transport will continue to operate.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to sign off plans to move from the ""containment"" phase of the outbreak to ""delay"" at the emergency Cobra meeting later.

""We do need to respond with calm, with unity, with discipline and resolve,"" he said.

""These are the right measures at the right time based on the best public health advice.""

'Decisive and rapid'

Mr Holohan said the measures announced by the government were ""early, decisive, rapid, co-ordinated and comprehensive"" and offered the ""greatest chance of mitigating the impact"" of the outbreak.

""But it is not to say it is going to prevent an increase in cases. We expect to see that,"" he said.

Twenty-five post-primary schools are to get extra places for new pupils in 2020.

The Department of Education (DE) has created 443 additional places to cope with an expected increase in demand in some areas.

Twenty schools have also been given 361 extra places in expectation of increased pupil numbers in 2021.

The department had previously warned of pressures on post-primary places in 2020 and 2021.

As a result they had asked principals to apply for temporary increases in their pupil intake for those years.

In 2019, 226 pupils had not got a post-primary place when the initial transfer process concluded in June and there was concern that number could rise this year.

The number of pupils due to transfer in 2020 is 24,017, compared to 21,732 in 2017 - a rise of more than 10%.

Those figures do not include pupils with statements of special educational needs, who are placed through a different process.

'Focus on welfare of children'

The department has now decided that a number of post-primaries in Belfast, north Down, Strangford, Newry and Armagh, Fermanagh and south Tyrone, south Antrim and mid-Ulster will get extra places.

In Belfast Grosvenor Grammar, Ashfield Boys' and Girls' High schools, Strathearn College, Our Lady and St Patrick's Knock, St Malachy's College, Dominican College and Blessed Trinity College will admit between 10 and 30 more pupils in 2020.

In addition, Aquinas Grammar will admit 20 extra pupils in 2021, though none in 2020.

St Patrick's College in Dungannon will get 22 extra places in both 2020 and 2021 while the nearby St Patrick's Academy will admit 15 more pupils than normal in those years.

In Magherafelt, St Pius X College is to admit 30 extra pupils in both years while St Mary's Grammar is to admit 12 additional pupils.

Antrim Grammar will get 24 extra places in 2020 and 2021.

In Newry, St Colman's College will take 15 more pupils and Our Lady's Grammar will admit 28 more in 2020 and 2021.

St Paul's Bessbrook will take 30 additional pupils into year 8 in both years.

In north Down and Strangford, Bangor Academy, Bangor Grammar, St Columbanus College, Regent House, Saintfield High, Movilla High, Nendrum College, Glastry College and Strangford Integrated will all admit some extra pupils in 2020.

Five of those schools, mainly in Bangor, will admit extra pupils again in 2021.

Education Minister Peter Weir said his department had carried out a detailed analysis of where demand was greatest.

""In light of this, I have moved to provide additional Year 8 places in areas where pressure is expected to be highest and have authorised an additional 443 places in 2020 and 361 places in 2021,"" he said.

""My focus is on the welfare of children and to minimise stress on families at transition and I may authorise further increases during the admissions process if they are required.""

A number of schools have already sought permanent increases in enrolments which is a separate process.

Schools will still be able to apply for future temporary increases in their pupil numbers should admission pressures arise later in the transfer process.

338,,Zimbabwe crisis: Parents of school dropouts face jail,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Many schools opened up in Zimbabwe after independence in 1980

Parents in Zimbabwe could face up to two years in jail if they fail to send their children to school.

The government has made education compulsory up to the age of 16 to stem rising school dropout figures blamed on the poor state of the economy.

It is estimated that in some parts of the country 20% of children do not go to school.

The new law also makes it is an offence to expel children for non-payment of school fees or for becoming pregnant.

Last year at least 60% of the children in primary school were sent home for failing to pay fees, according to the state's Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVac).

Zimbabwe's first leader Robert Mugabe, a former teacher who died last year, was praised for the education policies he adopted after independence in 1980.

The school system he established gave black Zimbabwean greater access to education as hundreds of state schools were opened, leading to Zimbabweans enjoying among the highest literacy rates in Africa.

However, free education ended in the 1990s and in the following decade the education system began to crumble.

What has changed?

The education law has been amended to make sure children in Zimbabwe go to school for a total of 12 years, five years more than was previously prescribed.

Image copyright AFP Image caption State schools are also suffering from a shortage of resources

Parents are now also in the firing line if their offspring fail to go to school.

They face up two years in jail - or a $260 (£200) fine if they can afford to pay it - if their children are found not to be attending classes.

The BBC's Shingai Nyoka in the capital, Harare, says it seems to be a bold attempt to force parents to prioritise education during an economic crisis.

But some believe the government is shirking its responsibilities amidst broken promises to provide free basic education and a chronic shortage of state schools.

The high drop-out rate has also been blamed on pregnancy, early marriages, the long distances to schools and a lack of interest, our reporter adds.

Why are children dropping out?

By Shingai Nyoka, BBC News, Harare

Parents have been spending less on education as they struggle to buy food. Fees at government-run schools must be paid up front and range from between $30 (£23) and $700 a year, depending on where they are based.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Unregistered schools don't insist on school uniforms

Last year, parents spent a third what they did in 2018 on education, says ZimVac.

In a sign of the desperate times, makeshift schools in poor areas of the capital, like Epworth, have been sprouting up in homes and backyards. They are unregistered - and therefore illegal. They can work out cheaper - about $3 a month - though their main draw is their flexibility about when the fees are paid.

Eunice Maronga, who runs one of these schools, says the children bring in money if and when they can. They are also more flexible about uniforms, though a $3-education has its drawbacks: no desks and one textbook - for the teacher.

""The reason why there is an increase in unregistered schools is because of the shortage of government schools - to the tune of about 2,000 schools,"" says Liberty Matsive, from the non-governmental organisation Education Coalition of Zimbabwe.

Elizabeth Chibanda, whose children are at home after her food-vending business collapsed, says she has sent her eight-year-old daughter back to her home village.

""She is doing nothing in the village, but I was ashamed to have a grade-three student sitting around, when it's so obvious to everyone she should be in school.""

Ms Chibanda said she was unable to get her son, who is six, into grade one at the start of the school year in January: ""With my son, I can pretend he is not of school-going age yet.""

Why is the economy is such bad shape?

Mr Mugabe was ousted from power in November 2017 with the hope that his army-backed successor and former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, would help revive the economy.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About 89% of adult Zimbabweans can read and write - among the highest literacy rates in Africa, according to 2014 World Bank data

But things have gone from bad to worse - and a decade on from the hyperinflation that devastated the economy, Zimbabwe is again facing rampant inflation, frequent shortages of foreign currency, food, fuel, electricity and medicine.

The country, which was once a major food producer, is also currently in the middle of a drought.

Last week, the US extended sanctions against Zimbabwe's top leaders, citing their actions to ""undermine democratic processes or institutions"", persecuting critics and economic mismanagement.

President Mnangagwa has blamed sanctions for crippling development in the country.

But Washington says their economic impact is limited to the farms and companies owned by about 80 of the targeted individuals, who include the president.

Inspectors said: ""Behaviour management has improved, but is not having sufficient impact. There are frequent assaults on staff by pupils.

""While the majority of pupils behave well, not enough is done to stop the unacceptable behaviour of a few.

Treasury minister Kemi Badenoch said the government would pay the extra leave, rather than businesses.

Mrs Ogilvy - who spent time in a neonatal ward after her son, Samuel, was born 10 weeks early - has petitioned to extend parental leave following premature birth since 2015.

Her campaigning has seen the Mayor of London, Sony Music and a number of London councils adopt policies to give extra leave to staff who have babies born early.

Ms Rudd, who stepped down as an MP in December, was due to speak to the UN Women Oxford UK society on Thursday.

Following a vote of its committee, understood to relate to her role in the Windrush scandal, the invitation was pulled.

Ms Rudd said some students' treatment of her was ""badly judged and rude"".

She had been due to speak about UN Women's Draw A Line campaign and her experiences of being an MP and minister for women and equalities.

Ms Rudd urged students to ""stop hiding and start engaging"".

She resigned as home secretary in April 2018 after people living legally in the UK were detained and deported and she inadvertently misled a Commons committee about the number of people who had been involved.

The UN Women Oxford UK society wrote on Facebook on Thursday: ""Following a majority vote in committee, tonight's event with speaker Amber Rudd has been cancelled.

It added it was ""deeply sorry for all and any hurt caused"" over the event.

342,,Coronavirus elderly advice: How can I look after my older relatives?,"Image copyright EPA

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drop-off point to receive samples of the coronavirus for testing at Leeds General Infirmary

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Age UK's online advice adds: ""The government hasn't said we should stop going out or meeting up with other people.

""Most people can keep doing what they normally do as long as they don't have symptoms and maintain good hygiene practices like washing their hands regularly.

343,,Will UK schools close over coronavirus?,"Image copyright Cransley School Image caption Cransley School in Cheshire has been closed over coronavirus symptom fears

Some UK schools have closed over fears pupils and staff members may have been exposed to coronavirus after travelling abroad during the half-term break.

Others have sent pupils and staff home, as the illness continues to spread across Europe.

However, Public Health England (PHE) says it is not advising schools to shut to stem the spread of the virus.

Why are some schools closing their doors?

One academy chain chief executive told BBC News the decision to close one of his schools - Trinity Catholic College, in Middlesbrough - was primarily about the school's duty of care towards pupils and staff.

Hugh Hegarty, head of the Nicholas Postgate Catholic Academy Trust, which oversees the closed school, said he had made the decision after 36 pupils and eight staff members returned from a skiing trip to Italy over half-term.

""It's important people acknowledge that schools and other organisations have a duty of care to staff and have a duty of care to their children - and that is my paramount concern,"" said Mr Hegarty.

""The challenge for us was... the children had returned to school on Monday, so there had been the potential that the total school population had been exposed - even though it was minimal - to the potential risk and potential threat.

""The decision was made to advise those parents who had children on the ski trip to self-isolate and the other students to remain at home until we commence a deep clean.""

In Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the ContinU Plus Academy closed for the day on Wednesday after a staff member had been in ""close contact"" with a family member self-isolating following a trip to northern Italy.

William Martin Church of England Junior, Infant and Nursery School in Harlow, Essex, also closed on Wednesday after a staff member had returned from Italy.

Head teacher Gina Bailey said: ""The school is closed for one day and it is purely as a precaution. The staff member is not displaying any symptoms of the virus.""

But other schools have decided not to close following ski trips to northern Italy.

At St Aldhelm's Academy, in Dorset, head teacher Jon Webb wrote to parents: ""As it currently stands, we are not aware of anyone returning from the ski trip who are displaying symptoms that would cause us to have any concerns.""

What is the official advice to schools?

PHE's medical director Prof Paul Cosford acknowledged schools had to take ""difficult decisions given the complexity of the issues that they're facing"".

""Of course, schools have difficult decisions to take - a whole range of issues to take into account and we are able to talk to them about their specific circumstances and help them make the right decisions for them,"" he said.

""But what I would say is that our general advice is not to close schools.""

Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""no blanket closure"" for schools and the ""goal was to keep schools open"".

""If anyone has been in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or an educational setting, no special measures are required while test results are awaited,"" Mr Hancock told MPs.

""There is no need to close the school or send other students or staff home.

""Once the results arrive, those who test negative will be advised individually about returning to education.

""In most cases, closure of the childcare or education setting will be unnecessary but this will be a local decision based on various factors including professional advice.""

Head teachers in England should contact their regional schools commissioners should they need advice, he added.

Dr Bharat Pankhania, from University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""If you have returned from the area of northern Italy that is currently in lockdown since 19 February, you need to self-isolate, as per the advice from Public health England and the UK government.

""However, there's no need for a school to close. There are consequences to closing schools.

""It's disproportionate and it gives the wrong impression. It makes people extremely concerned, when there's no need to be.""

Official government guidance for educational settings says if a pupil or member of staff is confirmed as having coronavirus, anyone who has been ""in close face-to-face or touching contact, including those undertaking small group work (within 2m [6ft] of the case for more than 15 minutes)"" should self-isolate at home, or within their boarding school dormitory room, for 14 days"".

Does parental pressure affect head teachers' decisions?

Some parents have expressed concern via social media about their child coming into contact with the coronavirus, particularly if fellow pupils have been away in northern Italy.

But while some parents want to see schools closed, others do not want their child's education to be disrupted.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Schools listen carefully to the views of parents and they will obviously have regard to this feedback in making decisions over how to respond to any situation regarding coronavirus.

""However, it is often the case that different parents will have different views over an unfolding event, so school leaders have to take this range of opinion on board, together with the views of other stakeholders, and make a judgement on what response serves the best interests of all pupils and staff.""

Could there be an impact on the exam season?

With the exam season coming up next term, some teachers, parents and young people may be worried about disruption to important exams.

But the exams watchdog Ofqual said it was monitoring the situation closely and students should not be concerned.

""We routinely consider whether there are particular risks to the smooth running of exams and we are working closely with the exam boards and with the Department for Education,"" a spokesman said.

""We will update our existing guidance to reflect any specific arrangements schools and colleges should put in place if required.

""In the meantime, students should continue to prepare for the summer exams as usual and schools and colleges should ensure their contingency plans are up to date.""

Mr Barton added: ""We would urge students who are studying for their exams not to worry about what may or may not happen with regards to coronavirus and to concentrate on preparing for these important qualifications.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,BBC,Education,True
344,,Coronavirus: Schools told no delays so far to exams,"Image copyright PA Media Image caption There have been worries about the impact of coronavirus as the exam season approaches

The exam watchdog, responding to concerns about coronavirus, is telling schools in England to keep preparing as usual for the summer exam season.

Ofqual says it is working with exam boards and the government to make contingency plans if there is a ""widespread outbreak"".

But until that becomes necessary, the watchdog is telling schools to assume exams will continue as scheduled.

Most GCSEs and A-level exams are planned to run from early May.

On Monday, Ofqual issued advice that ""students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer exams and assessments as usual"".

But it said there would be guidance to ""manage any particular risks"" to the exam season if coronavirus became widespread.

The watchdog said it would send any updated information when necessary - and also shared existing contingency plans for exams being disrupted.

This covers emergencies that might happen during the exam season - which could see pupils having to take an exam in a different location from their own school or rearranging the time of an exam.

But these responses are usually for problems facing a small number of individual schools, pupils or staff.

So far, more than 20 schools have been closed at some point in response to concerns over coronavirus - and others have sent home pupils, such as those who had returned from a half-term trip to an area with higher levels of the virus.

'Best advice'

In the most recent cases involving the virus, there were reports of a member of staff infected in a primary school in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and in an infant school in Woodley, Berkshire.

But some of these schools will have returned to normal - and the great majority of the school system, with more than 24,000 schools in England, does not seem to have been significantly affected by the virus.

With the exam revision season already bringing its own stresses, ASCL head teachers' union Geoff Barton said: ""Schools and colleges will be approaching the possibility of the coronavirus situation disrupting exams in a calm and measured manner, hoping for the best and preparing for the worst.

""We would urge students to focus on studying for their exams and not to worry about what may or may not happen.""

National Association of Head Teachers leader Paul Whiteman said: ""Our best advice to school leaders is to encourage them to stay on top of the continually updated advice from the government, share it with pupils and their families and act accordingly.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51707144,BBC,Education,True
345,"['Sean Coughlan', 'Bbc News']",Is the new passport really blue or black?,"Image caption The new passport (left) is a return to the ""iconic blue"" of the old one, the Home Office says

Is the new UK passport blue? Or is the colour really closer to black?

The Home Office has issued pictures of the post-Brexit passport, describing it as a return to the ""iconic blue"" used for UK passports before 1988.

Experts in the science of colour - and instant experts on social media - are unconvinced, saying they look more like black.

But a Home Office spokesman says the colours of both the old and new passports are shades of blue.

""I'd say it's black,"" says Stephen Westland, professor of colour science and technology at the University of Leeds.

""If most people looked at this, they'd say it's black.""

But he says describing colours in terms of names can be imprecise - and individuals will have their own different perspectives.

If enough blue is added to black, he says there will be a transition point when people will begin to see the colour as blue.

""But that point varies for different people,"" he says.

That means that some might see a colour as an extremely dark shade of blue, while others would see it as black.

Perhaps allowing the Home Office not to be entirely painted into a corner, he suggests the colour might be ""bluish black"".

But in essence, Prof Westland says, ""this is closer to black"".

However he says the perception of colour can be influenced by its context - and by calling it a ""blue passport"" people might be more likely to see it as leaning towards blue.

Replacing the burgundy-coloured European Union document, the new UK passport has been described as a return to the ""traditional colour"".

Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the return to this ""iconic blue"" was ""entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one"".

The Home Office would not specify the shade of this blue, although a spokesman said it was close to, if not exactly, a blue numbered as 5395C in the Pantone classification.

But Craig Burston, senior lecturer in graphic design at the London College of Communication, which incorporates what was the London College of Printing, says there is nothing to suggest the ""dominant colour"" of the new passport is blue.

He suggests the colour is charcoal, maybe with a hint of blue.

But if it is blue, ""it must be the most apologetic shade of blue they could find"" because ""it's as black as blue gets"".

""You'd be hard pushed to get something that is darker that would be defined as blue,"" Mr Burston says.

""It's as near as damn it black.""

Skip Twitter post by @EveOrEvie Can we stop fighting about whether the passports are blue or black, the word Navy exists for a reason. — Evie (@EveOrEvie) March 2, 2020 Report

There could be differences depending on printing processes, lighting and the ""sheen"", he says.

But the question of the colour seems to have been mixed up with the politics of ""blue passports"".

And the social-media debate seems to be about Brexit as much as colour charts.

A spokesman for paint company Farrow and Ball says ""pure"" black would have no other colours added.

But in practice, blacks used in the ""everyday world would have a slight colour to them"", such as blue, grey or red.

This could make the passport a very dark blue although ""some people may perceive it as black"".

It is ""probably black blue,"" said the paint firm's spokesman.

There have been other internet debates over identifying colours - such as whether a dress was blue or white and gold.

Prof Westland says this reflects how people tend to see colours in quite definite ways, coming down on one side or the other, even though we know there are all kinds of shades and ambiguities.

346,"['Hannah Richardson', 'Education', 'Social Affairs Reporter']",Legal victories over 'No DSS' letting agents,"Image caption Ms Staples needed accommodation after her marriage broke down

The battle against the discriminatory practice of landlords not renting to benefit claimants has intensified after legal victories by two single mothers.

Amanda Staples and Emma Loffler both won out-of-court settlements against ""No DSS"" letting agents, on the grounds of indirect discrimination.

In a 2018 case, another single mother, Rosie Keogh, backed by charity Shelter, successfully argued blanket bans on claimants indirectly discriminated against women and disabled people who are more likely to be on benefits.

Ms Keogh's case was cited in letters of complaint Ms Staples and Ms Loffler wrote to different letting agents who had refused to show them properties.

Shelter took on their legal cases when the agents refused to budge.

Personal circumstances

Ms Staples, 36, who has three primary-aged children, needed accommodation after her marriage broke down.

""I kept ringing around estate agents and when I said I would be a housing benefit [claimant] it was a blanket 'No,'"" she said.

When a property came up in the Cambridgeshire village she was based in, she was initially excited but then hit a wall.

""I had noticed 'No DSS' adverts before but I thought I would be able to find somewhere locally so my children could still go to the same school and so I could keep my job there,"" she said.

""It was really uncomfortable to keep having to explain my personal circumstances to strangers.

""The whole thing was so difficult - I was working part time, I've always paid my rent, I had a child-maintenance order, and I ended up on benefits because of the divorce and because I had three children.""

Ms Staples offered to pay six months' rent up-front, and then 12 months' after an offer of a loan from her father, but the letting agent kept saying the landlord's insurance did not cover tenants on benefits.

Image caption After Shelter supported her legal action, Ms Staples's boys were able to stay at the same school

She said: ""After a while, talking to this one particular estate agent, I just said; 'Nothing I say is going to make any difference is it?' And he said, 'No.'""

With Shelter backing her legal action, the letting agent ultimately agreed to write a public letter of apology and to pay £3,000 compensation and the £10,000 legal costs.

The agent in Ms Loffler's case, meanwhile, also issued a public letter of apology and paid £3,500 compensation and £2,500 towards legal costs.

'Grossly unfair'

Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said: ""The message is clear - letting agents and landlords must not treat potential tenants as second-class citizens simply because they rely on benefits.

""If they continue to blindly discriminate against those receiving housing benefit, they risk legal action and a hefty fine.

""Not only is 'No DSS' discrimination outdated and grossly unfair, it is unlawful under the Equality Act because it overwhelming impacts women and disabled people, who are more likely to need support paying their rent.""

Image caption Ms Loffler was paid £3,500 compensation

The housing charity analysed 7,100 adverts on the biggest letting agent websites, including OpenRent, Rightmove, Countrywide and Zoopla, and found more than one in 10 contained phrases such as ""No DSS"" or similar.

Agents and landlords could face fines of about £5,000 per advert based on the three payouts made in cases so far, it said.

But a poll of 1,009 private landlords for the charity by YouGov in December 2019 and January 2020 revealed:

86% thought ""No DSS"" was lawful or were not sure

29% said they did not currently let to people receiving housing benefit and were advised not to by their letting agent

The Residential Landlords Association urged the government to:

stop lenders preventing a landlord from renting to benefit claimants as a condition of their buy-to-let mortgage,

align housing benefit with local rent levels

restore the right of tenants to choose to have the housing element of their benefit paid directly to their landlord

How to fight 'No DSS' landlords and letting agents

Keep a written note of phone and face-to-face conversations if you start to hear a ""No DSS"" message. Hold on to any emails.

Ensure there is no other reason the agent will not let you rent

Provide agents with evidence of previous reliability and ability to pay with housing benefit

347,"['Sean Coughlan', 'Bbc News Family', 'Education Correspondent']",Biggest earners and biggest losers from degrees,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption University leaders say the value of higher education should be measured in more than just earning power

Higher pay still makes it financially beneficial to go to university for most students in England, says research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

But 20% are worse off after paying for courses, says the study commissioned by the Department for Education.

Over their working lives, male graduates on average gain by £130,000 and female graduates by £100,000.

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says students and taxpayers needed to get value from their ""investment"".

The government has promised to tackle ""low quality"" courses.

But university leaders say there can be other forms of social and personal ""value"" from higher education, as well as measurements of graduate earnings.

The study on projected earnings, based on tax data, shows wide variations in the financial winners and losers between different subjects.

For women, the financial gains of studying creative arts and languages are ""close to zero""

Medicine will bring an extra £340,000 for women, economics £270,000 and £260,000 for law

Men studying creative arts subjects are projected to lose £100,000, compared to their counterparts who did not go to university

For men in the top-earning subject areas of medicine and economics, the likely gain is £500,000

For both men and women there are low financial returns for graduates in English and biology

Individual universities are not identified, but more selective universities tend to lead to bigger earnings

These gains and losses are counted after the cost of going to university has been deducted.

This includes £9,250 per year in tuition fees, loans for living costs, interest charged on loans and lost potential earnings from studying rather than being in jobs.

The average student graduates with about £50,000 in debt.

More women go to university than men - and a higher proportion of women, 85%, compared with 75% of men, will get a positive financial return.

But female graduates have lower lifetime earnings, which the analysis says is likely to reflect women taking time off or reducing hours when they have children.

The gender gap in earnings opens when graduates are in their 30s - although the data does not distinguish between part-time and full-time work so part-time could look like lower pay.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The study will raise questions about which subjects should be funded

But for 70,000 students each year the costs of going to university - such as fees, loans and lost earnings while they studied - will be greater than any extra money they make in earnings, so they make less than their counterparts who went to work straight after A-levels.

Ben Waltmann, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the public finances gained on average from higher education, ""because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax"".

That still meant that government finances had to subsidise almost half of individual graduates - with the biggest losses concentrated in subjects such as creative arts.

There have been suggestions that funding could be restricted for degrees offering poor value to students.

And these findings are published as the government prepares its response to Philip Augar's review of student finance.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graduates with economics degrees are among the highest earners

This recommended that tuition fees should be cut to £7,500 and that students needed better value for money.

The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, is also carrying out a review into how funding grants should be prioritised between different subjects.

But the UCU lecturers' union has warned against making simplistic links between the quality of a course and future salaries.

""Earnings potential is also heavily impacted by factors such as an individual's background, their parents' jobs, their gender, where they are from and where they live after graduating,"" says union leader Jo Grady.

And she said decisions about the value of courses needed to reflect ""the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society"".

Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said it was crucial that university applicants had ""clear and factual information"" and ""data on earnings potential is an important part of that picture"".

Others argued that apprenticeships were better value.

""This analysis is fresh evidence of how the current university model is broken,"" said Euan Blair, co-founder of apprenticeship provider WhiteHat.

""Young people are being pressured to go to university without any consideration given to whether the experience will be positive or if they'll be equipped to pursue the career they want,"" he said.

But even when earnings might be relatively low, graduates might be working in sectors making ""vital contributions to the wider economy and society"", said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK.

He said it was important to recognise that the ""benefits of a degree stretch far beyond salary outcomes"".

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan also highlighted the ""unquantifiable experiences and friendships"" of university.

But she said the reputation of the university sector depended on ""quality"" and that had to be safeguarded so that ""students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51676530,BBC,Education,True

""It's educated people who are causing the most damage to the planet,"" says sixth-former Joe Brindle.

Joe, 17, says schools need to put the environment at the heart of education.

Ministers agree ""it is vital that pupils are taught about climate change"" but Joe says schools are failing to prepare them for a climate emergency.

He is a founder member of Teach the Future which next week takes its call for an environmental overhaul of education to Parliament.

""It's people with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge who are becoming fossil-fuel chief executives and they are the ones who are causing the most destruction to our world,"" says Joe.

""And therefore that kind of shows that education is not succeeding and that our education is broken because education should be creating better people not worse.""

On Wednesday, Joe, a pupil at Devizes School, and more than a dozen other under-18s who make up the core of Teach the Future, will take over Parliament's Terrace Pavilion to host a crowdfunded reception for MPs.

The group, run jointly by the UK Student Climate Network, best known for the school climate strikes, and the National Union of Students' climate charity offshoot, SOS-UK, is launching a draft English emergency education bill which embodies their key demands and which Joe believes ""is going to be really big"".

Teach the Future is hoping the draft could at some stage form the basis of a private member's bill but for now, the aim is ""to get MPs on our side"".

The idea is based on the 1958 US National Defense Education Act which aimed to kickstart engineering, maths and science education and give America the edge in the space and arms races.

It paid off - by July 1969, the average age in Apollo mission control was just 28.

""I think it really shows that education can be used to solve a difficult problem, if the focus is down from the government,"" says Joe, who will sit A-levels in history, biology and chemistry this summer.

Image copyright TRW/PhotoQuest/Getty Images Image caption Most mission control staff on Nasa's Apollo programme were in their 20s

But rather than focusing exclusively on science, technology, engineering and maths - the range of the climate emergency education act needs to be far wider, he believes.

""The space race was just one thing but the climate crisis affects every single part of everything and it requires solutions from every single part of society, whether it be arts, whether it be maths, whether it be sciences.""

He wants everyone to understand the impact of their behaviour on the environment and ""try to do things in a way that has as little negative impact as you can"".

And while engineers have an important role, fundamentally, education needs to become more sustainable, he says.

People need to understand how the climate crisis happened, he argues: ""It's a symptom of a general unsustainable system.""

Image copyright Joe Brindle Image caption Joe speaking at the NUS Sustainability Summit in November 2019

Joe believes most people his age ""want to understand more about climate change and what's behind it, the issues of justice... and the politics behind it"".

But he says that while schools are largely sympathetic, they are constrained by limited budgets and the demands of a high-stakes exam system - and often teachers themselves lack detailed knowledge about climate change.

""It's not good enough that sustainability is restricted to a few subjects and most of our teachers and lecturers don't know enough about it,"" say the campaigners.

They also point out that including climate change in the national curriculum will only affect local authority schools - not academies, free schools or the private sector.

The group has invited dozens of MPs to the reception and are ""particularly hoping government ministers and people close to the government will be there"".

Zero-carbon schools

Teach the Future's wish-list also includes having climate science and sustainability included in teacher training and all education buildings to have a net-zero carbon footprint by 2030.

The group was founded in autumn 2019 but already has support from leading education unions and environmental organisations. It is hoping that several dozen MPs will attend the reception.

In a statement, the government said: ""It is vital that pupils are taught about climate change, which is why topics are included across the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools. Teachers have the freedom to expand on these areas if they wish.

""This government is a world leader in tackling climate change and we are the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. The Department for Education provides funding to support schools to become more sustainable institutions.""

A spokesperson said topics related to climate change and sustainability were included in the national curriculum for science and geography, a new environmental science A-level was introduced in 2017 and sustainability will be included in some new T-level technical qualifications, for example, construction students will learn about renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies.

Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to protect themselves from coronavirus.

When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

The government is to release social distancing advice for elderly people on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods.

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35.

Mr Hancock told the BBC that manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS.

He also said hotels could be converted into makeshift hospitals, while the government has begun negotiating with private healthcare providers to obtain thousands of extra beds in private hospitals.

What are the latest figures?

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest Department of Health figures.

Almost all of the new cases were in England, but 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

Most of the 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK have so far been people aged over 60 and with underlying health conditions.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are no longer being tested. The government says tests will primarily be given:

To all patients needing hospital treatment for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

What are the government's plans?

Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would soon be asked to self-isolate - but he did not say for how long.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends as long as they stayed 2m (6ft) away from them.

The health secretary also said the NHS would stop non-urgent surgery and retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those with the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19.

The Scottish government said it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.""

Scottish ministers have also advised against gatherings of 500 people or more. They do not have the power to call off events but have urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" by cancelling such gatherings from Monday.

Who are the latest victims?

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol, who died at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"".

She urged people not to visit her and her family until their own test results for the virus came back.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, on 29 February.

How many ventilators are needed?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment - but that many times that number would be needed.

Car companies and weapon manufacturers are among the firms the government has asked to help to make ventilators to treat Covid-19 patients.

Ventilators treat severe breathing problems caused by Covid-19 by giving people oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from their lungs.

Digger manufacturer JCB said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if it could help.

JCB chairman Lord Bamford said it was ""unclear"" whether the firm could agree to do so, but that engineers were ""actively looking"" at the request.

Why and when should vulnerable people self-isolate?

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks.

That's why it's essential people don't start too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self-isolating.

But officials recognise individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

What else is going on?

South Africa has barred some foreigners from entering and will close schools

350,"['Tom Burridge', 'Transport Correspondent', 'Bbc News']",Train companies seek bailout as coronavirus hits passenger numbers,"Image copyright Getty Images

The government is in talks with rail bosses to put emergency measures in place to deal with falling passenger numbers after the coronavirus outbreak.

Some train operators were already losing money but fewer fares will put even more pressure on their finances.

A senior industry source said fairly drastic measures might be required for train companies to survive.

At an industry meeting last week, passenger numbers were said to have fallen by up to 18% on certain lines.

However, another industry source acknowledged that the fall in passengers could be significantly higher.

They told the BBC that the number of passengers travelling through major UK train stations at peak times had dropped considerably in recent days.

Very up-to-date figures for the whole UK network are not known as many tickets are still not purchased digitally, so it takes some time for the data to filter through.

Under franchise agreements, train companies have a range of contractual obligations, which govern how many trains they run and restrict how much they can charge for tickets.

They are also required to make payments to the government to run services on parts of the rail network.

The number of trains, the price of tickets and the amount companies pay government are all calculated based on assumptions about passenger numbers.

But, with fewer people catching the train - as some companies ask staff to work from home over fears about the spread of the coronavirus - the ability of rail companies to meet some of those obligations is now in doubt.

Emergency talks

The BBC understands that train operators are in talks with government to renegotiate the terms of some of those contracts.

Train companies want the government to give them more wriggle room so they can keep operating services for essential travel for people working in the emergency services, even though broader passenger numbers have fallen.

Options being discussed are likely to include a reduction in the number of train services and flexibility over the payments that train companies make to government.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""We recognise how difficult the current situation is for the transport sector and, across government, we are engaging with the sector's leadership to support workers, businesses and passengers.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51896169,BBC,Politics,True
351,,Coronavirus: Supermarkets ask shoppers to be 'considerate' and stop stockpiling,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves

Supermarkets are urging shoppers not to buy more than they need amid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.

In a joint letter, UK retailers have reminded customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items.

""There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" it adds.

It comes after some shops began rationing the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely.

In the letter, the retailers say online and click-and-collect services are at ""full capacity"" and staff and suppliers are ""working day and night to keep the nation fed"".

The retailers say they are working ""closely"" with government and suppliers to make more deliveries to stores so that shelves are well-stocked.

""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without,"" the letter reads.

That was echoed in an email to customers from Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who said: ""There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked.""

In a plea to shoppers, he said: ""Please think before you buy and only buy what you and your family need.""

Speaking on behalf of retailers, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.""

The plea follows widespread concern over shoppers emptying supermarket shelves as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus.

Long queues were reported outside some supermarkets on Sunday morning.

Items including toilet paper, hand sanitiser, pasta and tinned foods are among those that have been in short supply.

That has led some supermarkets to limit the sale of some products, while Aldi has restricted customers to buying a maximum of four of each item.

Tesco, shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including anti-bacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables.

Meanwhile, Waitrose has brought in a temporary cap on some items on its website, including some anti-bacterial soaps and wipes.

Boots and Asda are both restricting some types of hand sanitiser to two bottles per person.

Campaigners have warned stockpiling could hit the ""most vulnerable"" hardest.

Analysis

By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent

Supermarkets are used to spikes in demand, for example over the festive period. But they have usually been expecting them.

It has been clear from repeatedly emptied shelves that many shoppers have not heeded the official advice that there is no need to stockpile.

The BRC lobby group insists its members are resilient and there won't be long-term shortages. And supermarkets have adapted quickly. For example, Sainsbury's has told customers today that it has increased warehouse capacity and ordered more stock. Tesco is among the brands that will take up the government's offer of extending delivery hours to keep up with demand.

But with demand unprecedented for the time of year - weeks before the expected UK peak of the pandemic - this unusual joint letter from the major supermarkets shows they feel a strong message needs sending to customers. They will be hoping that the coordinated effort will help their strained supply chains cope and ensure everyone, including the most vulnerable, can get what they need.

Some food banks say they have a shortage of basic items which have already been panic bought by shoppers.

The government has said there is no need for anyone to stockpile items, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging people to ""behave responsibly and think about others"".

The government is relaxing restrictions on delivery hours for retailers to try to ensure shops remain stocked with basic items.

Deliveries to supermarkets are usually restricted overnight to avoid disturbing local residents.

Image copyright Julzz Ballard Image caption Shoppers faced a long queue at the tills in Morrisons in Kettering on Sunday

Environment Secretary George Eustice said allowing night-time deliveries would allow stock to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

Meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog has warned retailers not to ""exploit"" fears about coronavirus by dramatically increasing the price of protective goods such as hand gels and face masks.

352,,Coronavirus: English local elections postponed for a year,"Image copyright Getty Images

Local and mayoral elections in England will be postponed for a year to May 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Downing Street said it would be impractical to hold the elections as planned, as they would come during the peak of the spread of the virus.

Polls were due in 118 English councils, the London Assembly and for seven English regional mayors.

Voting was also due to take place for the London mayor and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.

It comes after the Electoral Commission said on Thursday the elections should be delayed until the autumn to ""mitigate"" the impact of the virus.

Meanwhile, visitor access to Parliament will be restricted from Monday, and MPs and peers are being ""strongly"" discouraged from making overseas trips.

Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the ""proportionate and reasonable"" measures would help preserve the operation of Parliament during the outbreak.

Ten people have died with the virus, with 798 cases confirmed UK-wide.

The Cabinet Office said it would be bringing forward legislation to enact the elections delay in England, and would ensure the Welsh authorities had the same powers.

The last time elections were delayed was in 2001, when they took place one month late due to the foot and mouth outbreak.

Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the move to delay the polls was the ""right decision"".

But he added it was ""not clear"" why the government had opted for a year-long delay, rather than postpone until the autumn as the Electoral Commission recommended.

Before the postponement was announced, Labour had backed calls for a delay, adding it had ""serious concerns"" about the welfare of party staff and members.

Labour General Secretary Jennie Formby wrote to local party branches earlier on Friday advising them to suspend campaigning ahead of the polls.

Defending the decision to delay the polls, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said it was important ""everyone feels confident they are able to take part"".

""Respecting the annual cycle of local government, postponing them seems to me in the circumstance to be the right thing to do,"" he added.

'Uncharted territory'

James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ""The LGA has been raising a number of issues with government including the possible impact of coronavirus on local elections. The swift decision is very helpful.

""Councils will now continue to put all of their efforts into supporting their local communities as the nation tackles Covid-19.""

The decision to delay the polls was also backed by the Association of Electoral Administrators.

Its chief executive Peter Stanyon said: ""This is uncharted territory and our members have been raising significant concerns about the safe delivery of these elections.""

Political events delayed

Labour has cancelled the special conference in London at which it was due to announce the result of its leadership election on 4 April.

The party said on Thursday it would instead put on a ""scaled-back event"" instead.

The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and Welsh Labour have all cancelled their spring conferences due to the spread of the virus.

The SNP and Scottish Conservatives have also announced their spring conferences will be postponed.

Only one MP, health minister Nadine Dorries, has tested positive for the virus - but an increasing number are self-isolating after either feeling unwell or learning that colleagues they have recently mingled with now have the virus.

Speaking on Friday, Mr Buckland said there was currently ""no evidence"" to suggest that keeping Parliament open posed a ""public health issue in itself"".

But he added: ""If that evidence and information changes, then we'll have to take appropriate steps.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51876269,BBC,Politics,True

Prison staff will be offered bonuses to cover shortages - and staff could be redeployed to cover front-line services.

A number of inmates died during unrest at several Italian prisons last week after visits were suspended.

The Prison Officers Association has compared conditions in England's prisons to those found on cruise ships and the Prison Governors Association has said cases of the virus are inevitable.

BBC News has seen advice issued to prisons, which says inmates who had contact with a known coronavirus patient should be isolated in single accommodation.

It is understood plans being drawn in up in Whitehall involve communicating regularly with inmates, making sure they can contact their families and providing extra materials - like books and magazines - to those isolating to try to avoid boredom.

The possibility of designating other buildings as prisons to cope with pressures has not been ruled out.

Senior figures do not believe large numbers of prisoners will have to be released to cope with any strain.

There is, however, significant concern about the impact on older prisoners with underlying health issues.

354,,Brexit: EU drafts trade deal ahead of talks with UK,"Image copyright Getty Images

The EU has drafted a post-Brexit trade deal proposal, covering areas such as security, foreign policy and fisheries.

The 441-page draft legal text, seen by the BBC, was sent to the 27 EU states on Thursday night, ahead of being presented to the UK next week.

But the BBC's Adam Fleming said much of the draft will be rejected by the UK because of references to EU law.

The two negotiating teams were due to meet in London for talks, but that has been cancelled due to coronavirus.

A joint statement from the UK and EU said they were ""exploring alternative ways to continue discussions"", such as video conferencing.

The UK left the EU at the end of January and entered the so-called transition phase, where the country continues to abide by most of the bloc's rules while a trade deal is negotiated.

Boris Johnson has said if an agreement is not made by the end of 2020, the UK will leave without one and go on to World Trade Organisation rules.

But critics said such a move would be the equivalent of a ""no deal"" Brexit and would damage the UK economy.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove has also said the government could walk away from talks as early as June if a ""broad outline"" of a deal has not been agreed.

Asked if that position could change due to the threat of coronavirus outbreak causing delays, the PM's spokesman said the transition period would still end this year, adding: ""In UK law, a request for an extension is not possible.""

'Level playing field'

The draft legal text, called the ""New Partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom"", was drawn up by the European Commission.

The document includes a lot of blank sections and placeholders.

But it also makes a number of proposals, including:

A joint partnership council with 16 subcommittees, including one dedicated to the so-called ""level playing field""

Level playing field proposals on competition, taxation, labour and social protection, and the environment

Long term agreements over access to British waters for EU boats, with annual negotiations

Co-operation on data exchange and extradition, if the UK continues to implement the European Convention on Human Rights

The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the text ""shows [an] ambitious and comprehensive future relationship is possible"", adding: ""We must give ourselves every chance of success.""

But the UK government has already said it would not accept any alignment with EU laws as they are updated.

It has also rejected the EU's call for ""level playing field"" guarantees - where British companies would be given tariff-free access to the EU market if they do not undercut their rivals within the bloc.

However, the EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards.

The British negotiating team will take a red pen to large sections of this EU draft treaty.

They reject the idea of the deal referring to specific European laws.

They don't want the words ""European Court of Justice"" to appear anywhere.

And the proposal on fishing will be seen as limiting the UK's control of its own waters.

It will be worth scrutinising the text carefully, as there are lots of more technical areas of agreement that could form the basis of an eventual deal.

However, the two sides disagree on whether there should one big blockbuster deal or several smaller ones - and that's an argument that's potentially unsolvable.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51871155,BBC,Politics,True

Parliament may still be open for business but the coronavirus crisis is rapidly changing life for MPs.

Although only one has so far tested positive - the health minister Nadine Dorries - an increasing number are choosing to self-isolate after either feeling unwell or learning that colleagues they have recently mingled with now have the virus.

New government advice recommends that people isolate if they develop symptoms themselves.

Security Minister James Brokenshire is working from home ""as a precaution"" for a week after attending a breakfast meeting in the United States with Australian counterpart Peter Dutton, who has since tested positive.

Edward Argar has insisted there has been no-let up in his vital work as a health minister despite voluntarily confining himself to his home, saying ""the red boxes are still coming"".

Conservative MP Dehenna Davison said she was secluding herself in line with the latest NHS guidance that anyone with a high temperature or a persistent cough should stay away from work for a week.

Posting a picture on Twitter of her laptop, diary and a packet of solpadeine, the Bishop Auckland MP said she was working remotely and in ""regular contact"" with her team, adding ""it's business as usual but just a bit more digital"".

Hundreds of MPs, whether they have shown any symptoms or not, are starting to grapple with how to continue to represent their constituents while scaling back their public engagements - potentially for a prolonged period.

Many, as a first step, have decided to postpone face-to-face constituency surgeries, which typically take place on a Friday and Saturday.

These are, arguably, the most important date in an MP's weekly diary - an opportunity for constituents to raise problems and talk confidentially.

Image copyright EPA Image caption MPs are using different platforms to keep in touch with their constituents

Ms Davison said postponing all face-to-face meetings was the ""responsible thing to do"" in the current climate.

Others have followed suit, including Bournemouth East MP Tobias Ellwood, who said he had made the ""profound"" decision to stop seeing constituents and also not to visit his elderly mother, who was recently discharged from hospital.

Although drop-in events are now off limits for many MPs, they are making clear that their constituents can still reach them by phone. Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, said he and his staff will ""continue to operate as normally as possible within the issued guidelines"".

Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, has been in self-isolation for several days but is continuing to deal with local casework over the phone as well as fulfilling her duties as the party's spokeswoman for employment rights.

""It is about making sure we function and keep up our support for people,"" she told the BBC. ""The issues that people have with benefits and housing are not going away.""

'Visibility'

The MP, who is currently in London, has not ruled out holding face-to-face meetings after she returns to her constituency. But she expects to ""remodel"" her working practices, doing more via Skype and other platforms.

""The whole thing about the visibility of MPs - that will change and we will play more of co-ordinating role. We must make sure we are de-escalating this, staying ahead of the curve, and putting in place procedures which will be resilient through the peak of the crisis.""

Neither of them developed symptoms and they both returned to work.

With events changing by the minute, MPs are having to make very careful judgements and, according to Rachael Maskell, ""there have been a lot of discussions on WhatsApp groups about the different decisions"" being taken.

Conservative David Johnston, the MP for Wantage, is contacting everyone booked in for his weekend surgery to see if they want to go ahead while his Banbury colleague Victoria Prentis is speaking to elderly and more vulnerable constituents.

Analysis

By Daniel Kraemer, BBC Political Research Unit

One of the priorities for the government in the next few weeks will be to pass emergency legislation to respond to the public health crisis.

To do this - without triggering emergency powers - Parliament must be open but it doesn't have to be fully attended.

Parliament needs to be ""quorate"" before it votes and make progress on legislation.

This means there need to be at least 40 MPs present. In the Lords, the number is 30.

And it doesn't matter how many for each party are there. So, theoretically, the government could make progress with just 11% of Conservative members in the House.

The Labour Party has repeatedly called for changes to be made to the law to allow people being affected by the coronavirus crisis to have access to statutory sick pay.

This is something that is expected to be contained in government legislation, which ministers say will be published in the coming week.

356,,Woman says Alex Salmond kissed her after doing zombie impression,"Image copyright PA Media

An SNP party worker has claimed Alex Salmond did an impression of a zombie before kissing her on both cheeks then trying to kiss her on the mouth.

The witness, known as Woman J, said the alleged incident - shortly before the independence referendum - had been ""like an awful nightmare"".

She also alleged that Mr Salmond later asked if she wanted to ""stay over"" at his Bute House residence.

Mr Salmond denies sexually assaulting Woman J in September 2014.

He has also pled not guilty to a further 13 charges of sexual assault against nine other women.

The alleged offences are all said to have happened when Mr Salmond was serving as Scotland's first minister and the leader of the SNP.

Woman J told the High Court in Edinburgh that she had been working with Mr Salmond in Bute House when she left the room to go to the toilet.

When she returned, she claimed to have ""utterly froze"" after finding Mr Salmond ""lying on the ground, between the dining table and the back of the sofa.""

She alleged that Mr Salmond had a pen and paper next to him, and told her to ""come here and work on this speech"".

Woman J said she lay on the ground some distance from Mr Salmond because she did not want to anger him.

The witness alleged that they were both working on the speech when ""out of the blue"" he asked: ""Have you seen that zombie movie?""

She claimed that Mr Salmond told her to stand up before he ""stretched his arms out straight towards me and did an impression of a zombie walking towards me"".

She added: ""He put his arms on my shoulders and leaned in to kiss me on one cheek and then proceeded to move me out of the way to kiss my other cheek.

""Then he leaned in to kiss me on the lips.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Woman J said the incident took place at Bute House

Woman J said she raised her arms to break his connection on her shoulders, and had attempted to act like nothing had happened.

But she alleged that Mr Salmond had later touched her briefly on the leg and face.

And she claimed he had said she could ""stay over"" if she wanted to - to which she had thought there was ""no way in hell I was"".

Under cross-examination from defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC, Woman J agreed that Mr Salmond was a ""touchy feely, tactile person"" who had sometimes kissed members of the public, and that she had thought that this was inappropriate.

Ms McCall put it to the witness: ""This incident with the zombie film, he says that never happened. You're going to tell me it did?""

Woman J replied: ""Yes"".

She also agreed that she had continued to work with Mr Salmond after the alleged incident.

Image copyright Jeff J Mitchell Image caption Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC described Mr Salmond as a ""tactile person""

Earlier in the day's evidence, a former civil servant known as Woman K claimed that photographs were taken of her as Mr Salmond grabbed hold of her bottom.

She said the photographs were taken at an event at Stirling Castle shortly before Mr Salmond stood down as first minister in November 2014.

Woman K claimed that Mr Salmond had been ""very insistent"" that she have her photograph taken with him.

She alleged that, as they were standing in front of the photographer, Mr Salmond put his arm around her before he ""reached down and grabbed hold of my backside"".

Woman K said Mr Salmond had done this ""quite forcefully with his full hand"" and it had felt ""very deliberate"".

She said she had felt ""shock and disbelief"" but had tried to ""just keep smiling"".

She said: ""I just want to do my job and feel proud of myself doing my job and it felt like I was being demeaned.

""It was unprofessional but there was nothing I could do about it.""

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Gordon Jackson QC suggested that the alleged incident involving Woman K was not sexual

The court was shown a series of photographs of the woman with Mr Salmond.

She appeared to have her eyes shut in several of them, and to be looking at Mr Salmond in another.

Woman K told the court that she looked ""very embarrassed"" because of ""what had just happened"".

She said another photograph shown to the court showed a ""look of disbelief"" on her face.

The witness said she had no choice but to get on with her job, but the next day she told her manager what had happened ""to make sure he was aware"".

What has the trial heard so far?

Woman K later agreed with defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC when he put it to her that she had thought the alleged incident ""wasn't sexual, it was about power"".

She said: ""That was my interpretation. The first minister grabbed by backside because he could.""

She also agreed that she had once described Mr Salmond as ""genuinely concerned and nice"" when she became unwell at work.

And she agreed that she had phoned Mr Salmond the next day to thank him for helping her.

Woman K also said that she had already contacted the Scottish government before it set up a helpline for people to report any allegations of inappropriate behaviour.

But she agreed that at that stage she wanted the complaint to go through the government rather than the police.

Dozed off

A third complainer, a Scottish government civil servant known as Woman D, told the court that it was a ""fairly regular occurrence"" for Mr Salmond to put his hands on her bottom when they were walking together, and that he had touched her face, hair and arms.

She said it made her feel uncomfortable, but she had put up with it because ""he was the leader of the country"" and she was worried it would damage her career if she put in a complaint.

Woman D went on to claim that she had once dozed off while in a car with Mr Salmond during a foreign trip - and had felt ""shocked"" and ""pretty icky"" when she woke up to find him stroking her face.

And she alleged that Mr Salmond had reached out to touch her face in a lift, before a colleague knocked his hand away and said something like ""What do you think you are doing?""

Defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC asked Woman D if she had once shown Mr Salmond a holiday picture of herself in a ""somewhat skimpy bikini"".

When she replied that she had only done so because Mr Salmond had asked to see her holiday photos, Mr Jackson replied: ""I take it you don't just take bikini photos? Why show him that one?""

Woman D replied: ""I don't know.""

Mr Salmond says he is innocent of all the allegations against him.

357,"['Brian Wheeler', 'Political Reporter']","Judicial review: 'Snarling' not the way to get reform, says former top judge","Image copyright PA Media Image caption Lord Sumption was a Supreme Court justice from 2012 to 2018

""Shouting and snarling"" is not the way to get judges to accept curbs to their powers, a former top judge has warned.

Lord Sumption said the judiciary was likely to accept ""reasonable"" measures to address government concerns they are meddling in politics.

But he said the government would be mistaken if it thought ""abuse"" was the way to ""get things done"".

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a review into the relationship between government and the courts.

Later this year, the government will launch a wide-ranging Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission to take an ""in depth"" look at the issue. There will also be a separate Royal Commission on the criminal justice process.

'Not revenge'

The 2019 Conservative manifesto said: ""We will ensure that judicial review is available to protect the rights of the individuals against an overbearing state, while ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays.""

The government has so far released few details about how the commission will work and how far it wants to go in limiting the power of judges to overturn government decisions.

The commission will be overseen by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, working alongside Justice Secretary Robert Buckland and Attorney General Suella Braverman. Lord Sumption is reportedly being tipped by officials to be its chairman.

Image caption The Supreme Court's Article 50 ruling sparked a press backlash

Ministers believe questions need to be asked to ""clarify what it is a judicial review is for"", senior government sources say.

Some ministers have argued that judicial reviews should not be used as a substitute for the work of Parliament.

But they have said any reforms will not be ""revenge"" for controversial decisions over Brexit - instead saying it will be about making the system better.

The prime minster's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is also keen on limiting judicial review powers.

In 2015, he argued on his personal blog that ""major reform"" was needed but it was an ""extremely fraught"" and complex issue, and entangled with Human Rights law and how the civil service ""uses all this to enmesh ministers in management chaos to stop things they don't like"".

What are judicial reviews?

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Campaigners against a third Heathrow runway celebrate a court victory

A type of court case that allows members of the public to challenge the legality of a government decision

It can be a decision by a government department, a regulator, a local council and certain other public bodies

Judicial reviews can not overturn entire Acts of Parliament passed by MPs

Decisions can be challenged on the grounds that a minister did not have the power to make it, or the process leading up to it was unfair or irrational

A decision can also be overturned if a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with the Human Rights Act

Most cases do not get very far - in 2018 only 218 made it as far as a court hearing, out of 3,597 that were lodged

Of the cases that reached court, the government won 50% of them

Some members of the judiciary fear the government is seeking revenge for the Supreme Court's ruling in September that the government acted illegally in seeking to prorogue Parliament ahead of October's Brexit deadline.

More recently, ministers were left fuming when the Court of Appeal ruled against the removal of 25 foreign offenders scheduled to be on a deportation flight.

Lord Sumption, who was a Supreme Court justice between 2012 and 2018, has said he does not accept that the court overstepped the mark in September's prorogation judgement - or in a 2017 ruling forcing the government to hold a vote on triggering Article 50.

But he argued that courts were too often failing to distinguish between the legality of a minister's decision and ""cases where the judge simply does not like the underlying policy"". He said this was a particularly concern in immigration and benefit cases.

'Proper forum'

In a BBC Parliament lecture at King's College London, he said: ""We are only a democracy because ministers are answerable for the formation and execution of policy to Parliament.

""Parliament may not always be as effective as it should be. But the House of Commons is the only institutional means by which the electorate can influence policy.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Gina Miller spearheaded two successful challenges to government policy

""The appropriation by the courts of the right to decide where the public interest lies cuts across demarcation lines which are fundamental to the democratic state.

""Parliament is the proper forum for political opposition to the government. The courts are not.""

The former judge also argued that any shake-up of Britain's constitution must include electoral reform arguing that the first-past-the-post system produced governments without broad support.

'Unnecessary hostility'

He also argued that some international treaties, such as the European Human Rights Convention, lacked democratic legitimacy.

He said there was ""every prospect that judicial cooperation will be forthcoming if the measures proposed are reasonable and directed only to the more overtly political manifestations of judicial activism"".

But he warned that any attempt to reform the judiciary - or any other institution with wide public support - would fail if the government was too confrontational in its approach.

""People tend to judge politicians by their tone as much as their substance. Abuse is not a useful tool of policy. Shouting and snarling provokes unnecessary hostility among the electorate which will ultimately doom the whole project.""

358,,Coronavirus: Government insists schools should stay open,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption There are real worries over the impact the virus will have on learning

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said keeping schools open in England is the ""best course of action"", despite fears about the coronavirus.

It comes as blanket school closures are being announced in European nations such as Spain, France and Ireland.

He told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that sending all pupils home would put a big strain on key workers who would also have to stay at home.

School leaders agreed keeping schools open was the right decision.

Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which is meeting for its annual conference, said head teachers would authorise absence if parents took the decision to keep their children off lessons.

'Exams worry'

He anticipated absences would be small in scale and similar to ""snow days"".

The government has said individual schools may be advised to shut by Public Health England if necessary.

Mr Barton said there was pressure from parents for more information and guidance about what might happen to national exams.

The exam season starts in early May, when the virus outbreak is expected to reach its peak, but exam regulators are urging schools to prepare for public exams as normal.

GCSE exams start in the second week of May and run until mid-June.

Mr Barton said many head teachers were facing questions about the exam season, and there was an urgent need for reassurance.

""Parents and pupils are worried about being the victim of something out of their control and are asking, 'Will I get into college or university?'""

Mr Williamson said: ""We're doing everything we can to make sure it's fair for students, we're having regular discussions with Ofqual.""

The government warned on Thursday that within weeks, whole households would be asked to self-isolate if one person showed symptoms consistent with coronavirus.

It is not clear exactly what this would mean for a teenager unable to sit their exams, but there are mechanisms for allocating marks in exceptional circumstances, which have been used before.

The Welsh government has been advised that school closures are not an appropriate move at the moment, though the situation remains under review.

The Scottish government has also said school closures would not be an effective measure at this stage.

The Republic of Ireland's decision to close schools, colleges and public childcare facilities until 29 March is likely to affect businesses in Northern Ireland's border region that employ staff from the Irish Republic.

In the meantime, many schools will continue to assess how technology could be used to continue pupils' learning in the event of isolated closures.

Sharon Bruton, chief executive of the Keys Federation Academy Trust in Wigan, whose schools use an artificial-intelligence learning platform, said teachers could set assignments via email and social media accounts.

""Schools are adaptable and flexible places - I'm certain school leaders and curriculum leaders will be thinking about how teaching can continue for their students should this be an eventuality,"" she said.

""Educators are remarkably resilient and adaptable and I think part of our job is to meet the needs of our children and make sure they can thrive in challenging circumstances - and this [coronavirus outbreak] won't be any different.""

So the possibility of blanket school closures has been kicked down the road, but that doesn't remove the uncertainty entirely.

No head teacher can rule out the possibility their school could be affected at some point. More pressing is the likelihood that the peak in cases could coincide with exams due to begin in mid-May.

This might mean more households isolating, more teachers off work.

One option could be to move some exams to later in June, when fewer are traditionally scheduled to take place.

This would prolong the agony for teenagers, and their families, but could increase the chances of most being able to sit the exams that are the passport to the next stage of their life.

In the meantime, despite expert advice, some parents continue to call for school closures.

The exams watchdogs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all urging teachers and students to prepare for the exams season as normal.

In Scotland, where exams start earlier than the rest of the UK, the Scottish Qualifications Authority said there was no change to the 2020 national-qualifications timetable.

""Current deadlines for coursework, and other assessments, remain in place,"" it added.

England's exams watchdog, Ofqual, said: ""We continue to work closely with exam boards, other regulators and the Department for Education and we have met to plan for a range of scenarios, as the public would expect.

""Our overriding priorities are fairness to students this summer and keeping disruption to a minimum.""

Qualifications Wales said: ""We will provide guidance on our website to reflect any specific arrangements that schools and colleges should put in place if required.""

Northern Ireland's Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) said there were ""a broad range of contingencies to ensure the smooth operation of examinations"", which would be updated if necessary.

359,,RHI: 'Corruption did not cause' energy scheme failure,"Image copyright Charles McQuillan Image caption The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating

Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme.

The findings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme were published on Friday.

It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"".

The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating.

The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"".

Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost.

Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.

It became known as ""cash for ash"".

Arlene Foster 'sorry for failings'

The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster.

Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster

She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"".

Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"".

""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn Féin MLA said.

Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly.

The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself.

""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption RHI behaviour was 'unacceptable'

However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information.

The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford.

It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"".

The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism.

The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin

A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"".

The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"".

The lack of record keeping was also highlighted.

It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants.

""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said.

""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place.""

What was the RHI scandal?

The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers.

But the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.

It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget.

The financial scandal led to the collapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017 and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020.

A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it.

No expertise or support

Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"".

""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced.

""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported.""

A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014.

In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed.

The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better.

Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption The report said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour from Spads""

Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked.

The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"".

It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members.

Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party.

Inadequate governance

The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted.

The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"".

The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on.

This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"".

Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"".

""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme.

""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-51840287,BBC,Politics,True

361,,Smart motorways plan aims to boost safety,"Image copyright Gov.uk

The government says it wants to ""raise the bar"" on smart motorway safety, following criticism of the scheme.

Under the plan, opening motorway hard shoulders for traffic in busy periods will be scrapped.

On those smart motorways where the hard shoulder has been removed entirely, there will be an increase in places for vehicles to stop in an emergency.

Between 2015 and 2018, 11 people a year on average have died on smart motorways in England.

Announcing the plan to improve smart motorway safety, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had been ""greatly concerned by a number of deaths on smart motorways, and moved by the accounts of families who've lost loved ones in these tragic incidents"".

""The overall evidence shows that in most ways smart motorways are as safe or safer than conventional ones - but they are not in every way,"" he said.

A Freedom of Information (FoI) request sent by the BBC's Panorama to Highways England revealed that in one section of the M25, outside London, the number of near misses had risen 20-fold since the hard shoulder was removed in April 2014.

In the five years before the road was converted into a smart motorway, there were just 72 near misses. In the five years after, there were 1,485.

Jim O'Sullivan, the chief executive of Highways England, said: ""Every death in any road accident is tragic, and we are determined to do all we can to make our roads as safe as possible.""

There are two types of smart motorway in the UK.

The first is where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic when it is busy. The second is where the hard shoulder is open all the time and drivers who break down are encouraged to pull into emergency stops.

In addition to abolishing the ""confusing"" dynamic hard shoulder, the government has said it will also reduce the distance between places to stop in an emergency to three quarters of a mile where possible.

It says this will mean on future schemes, motorists should typically reach a stop every 45 seconds at 60mph. The maximum spacing will be one mile.

The government's plan also includes measures to:

Installing 10 additional emergency areas on the existing M25 smart motorway section

Speeding up the deployment of technology to detect 'stopped vehicles'

Making emergency areas more visible

Introducing more traffic signs giving the distance to the next place to stop in an emergency

Committing £5m to a communications campaign to increase awareness of how smart motorways work

Mr Shapps acknowledged the changes would cost ""quite a lot of money"", adding it could reach ""hundreds of millions of pounds"".

""Nothing is more important to me than making sure our road networks are completely safe,"" he said.

Meera Naran, whose son died on a smart motorway, welcomed the changes saying: ""I feel like this is a small mother's day present from Dev wherever he is.""

RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said it was welcome that the government had listened to drivers' concerns but added ""it remains to be seen if these measures go far enough to protect drivers"".

While the AA's Edmund King said the changes were ""a victory for common sense and road safety"".

But Labour MP Sarah Champion said the proposals did not ""go far enough"" and called on the government to restore smart motorways ""to traditional operation"".

She accused Mr Shapps of ""allowing these lethal roads to continue to operate"".

Image copyright Meera Naran Image caption Eight-year-old Dev Naran (left) was killed on a smart motorway when he was on his way home from visiting his critical ill brother (right).

Smart motorways were introduced with the aim of increasing capacity and easing congestion by using the hard shoulder as an extra lane.

But they have been criticised by the government minister who originally approved the roll-out in 2010.

Speaking to Panorama in January, Sir Mike Penning, who is no longer a minister, said he had been misled about the risks of taking away the hard shoulder.

The Conservative MP said he had agreed to the expansion in 2010 after a successful pilot on the M42 near Birmingham.

The pilot worked well because there were safe stopping points for motorists, called emergency safety refuges, on average every 600 metres.

But when the scheme was expanded across the country, the safety refuges were placed further apart - on some sections, they are 2.5 miles apart.

""They are endangering people's lives,"" said Sir Mike. ""There are people that are being killed and seriously injured on these roads, and it should never have happened.""

Responding to his comments, Highways England said the plans to expand smart motorways were approved by ministers and that it was working to gather the facts about safety.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51851421,BBC,Politics,True

The Budget measures to tackle the coronavirus are substantial, but limited, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).

The IFS gave its assessment the day after the chancellor announced a £12bn package to mitigate the economic effects of the virus.

It also warned that working from home would be harder for factory workers than for those in office jobs.

And many self-employed people would still not be entitled to sick pay.

""Mr Sunak will certainly want to monitor the effectiveness of the package and be ready to come back with more if necessary,"" the IFS said.

""This is a substantial package, well targeted at what it is seeking to achieve. It is, though, necessarily limited,"" it said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his first Budget to the Commons on Wednesday

""On the business side, it is aimed particularly at those businesses which might face a demand shock - those in hospitality, retail and so on.

""It does much less for those that might end up having to reduce production or close temporarily because staff can't come into work, either because they are ill, self-isolating or looking after children who have been sent home from school.""

'Very weak' forecasts

The IFS also described the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecasts for the UK economy as ""very weak"", even before factoring in long-term effects from the coronavirus.

GDP growth is the percentage change of how fast an economy is growing or shrinking over time.

The OBR said the growth rate was expected to dip to 1.1% this year, before picking back up to 1.8% in 2021.

The IFS called these projections ""feeble"" and said that the economy was ""not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus"".

Robert Chote, the OBR's chairman, said on Wednesday that given the severity of the outbreak, risks that the forecasts might need to be downgraded further were ""all too clear"", although the threat was difficult to quantify.

'Right economic thing to do'

Large rises in public spending also mean that general government spending will contribute more than half of GDP growth this year and the next.

Image caption The coronavirus is leading to shortages of hygiene items

The increased spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

He told the BBC on Thursday that interest rates were at a ""multi-decade low"" and he was ""not going to make an apology"" for the Budget.

Borrowing more money to invest into the UK is ""the right economic thing to do"", the chancellor has said.

Rishi Sunak told the BBC that interest rates were at a ""multi-decade low"" and he was ""not going to make an apology"" for the Budget - which included a £30bn package of investment.

The Bank of England announced a cut in interest rates on Wednesday.

But the Resolution Foundation warned of a £575 a year blow to households, even before the impact of coronavirus.

Its chief executive, Torsten Bell, said: ""In reality, once we take the economic impact of coronavirus into account, this is the weakest official growth outlook on record.""

Labour's John McDonnell told the BBC's Today programme he welcomed more investment from the government, but ""10 years of austerity brought the country to our knees"" and the Budget was ""only going part way to making up"" for Tory cuts.

The chancellor said the plans he laid out on Wednesday were a ""significant step change"" for the government and the amount it would invest in infrastructure.

As well as a £5bn emergency response fund for the NHS and a number of other measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, he announced spending of more than £600bn on roads, rail, housing and broadband across the next five years.

'Unprecedented'

Former Prime Minister Theresa May urged ""restraint and caution"" on spending after the Budget announcement.

She told the Commons: ""Although spending a lot of money may be popular and may seem the natural thing to do, there is, of course, that necessity to have a realistic assessment of the longer term impact of those decisions and of the longer term consequences.

""It is also necessary to ensure that we have that restraint and caution that enables us to make the public finances continue to be strong into the future.""

Mr Sunak defended his plans, saying he would be sticking to the fiscal rules set out in his the Tory's election manifesto.

""But we are going to take advantage of these historically and unprecedented very low interest rates to invest in the long-term productivity of our economy,"" he said.

""That is, I think, the right economic thing to do, whilst overall having stable management of our debt.""

Mr Sunak added: ""I am not going to make an apology for responding at scale in a comprehensive fashion to the immediate challenges we face from coronavirus. I do think that is the right thing to do.""

This is a new government with a new chancellor much hungrier for spending, much hungrier for borrowing and much less bothered about the size of the national debt - and we are talking about very, very big numbers here.

The case the government makes is: it is coherent and correct to do this as it is dead cheap for governments to borrow in the long term.

Rishi Sunak believes that what started off as a temporary, extraordinary period of low interest rates is basically now locked in for the long term.

It is the economic and political fashion now to think it is going to be a long-term situation, therefore if borrowing is so cheap, why wouldn't you want to be more flash with the cash?

But with respect to the economists, sometimes their crystal balls are a bit wonky, things can change, and some Conservatives on the backbenches believe this may not be the time to run up a new, additional, huge overdraft.

However, the government's judgement is 'now is the time' - not least because they want to be able to keep the very many promises they have made to electorate.

Easy budgets are ones where you stand up and write big cheques. But sometimes they pave the way for much harder budgets in the years to come.

The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

Big increases in borrowing

The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts.

And that figure does not include £12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak.

364,,Grooming gang research petition to be considered for Parliamentary debate,"Image copyright Getty Images

More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the release of Home Office research into the ""characteristics"" of grooming gangs.

The government has refused to release the information, telling The Independent it was ""not in the public interest"" to do so.

The issue will now be considered for a debate in Parliament, having passed the required number of signatures.

The Home Office said work on the issue was ""ongoing"".

In 2018, the then Home Secretary Sajid Javid ordered research into the ""characteristics and contexts"" of gangs abusing children, arguing that ignoring issues such as ethnicity is more likely to fuel the far-right.

He said he wanted officials researching the causes of gang-based exploitation to leave ""no stone unturned"".

The review came after grooming gangs were convicted in Huddersfield, Oxford, and Rotherham.

But the Independent reported last month that the government was refusing to release the research, saying it was not in the ""public interest"" in response to the publication's Freedom of Information request.

The petition, on the UK government and Parliament petitions website, reads: ""We, the British public, demand the release of the official research on grooming gangs undertaken by the government in full.

""Sajid Javid promised the review as home secretary in July 2018, pledging that there would be 'no no-go areas of inquiry'.

""'I will not let cultural or political sensitivities get in the way of understanding the problem and doing something about it,' he said at the time.""

Another petition calling for the information to be released, on the Change.org website, has gained more than 13,000 signatures.

The Home Office said child sexual abuse was a ""sickening crime"" and offenders ""will face the full force of the law"".

""We're pursuing work on a number of fronts to understand the characteristics of group-based offending and the contexts in which it occurs,"" it said in a statement.

""This includes ongoing work commissioned by the previous home secretary and will inform future government policies on child sexual abuse.

""New sentencing laws will also ensure the most serious violent and sexual offenders spend time in prison that matches the severity of their crimes, protecting victims and giving the public confidence in the criminal justice system.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51860230,BBC,Politics,True
365,,Pavement parking could be banned in England,"Image copyright Getty Images

Parking on pavements could be banned in England to help pedestrians, the Department for Transport has said.

With the exception of London - where a ban already exists - only lorries are currently prevented from pavement parking.

The government is to open a consultation on whether to give local authorities more parking powers.

The AA, however, has warned a ban could have ""unintended consequences"" and cause more widespread ""parking chaos"".

The consultation comes after a committee of MPs last year called for a nationwide ban on the ""blight"" of parking on pavements.

Witnesses told the Commons' transport committee that the worst cases of pavement parking were effectively trapping disabled, elderly and vulnerable people, making them ""afraid to leave their homes"".

The cross-party group said blocked-off walkways were also exacerbating the issue of loneliness in Britain.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Vehicles parked on the pavement can cause very real difficulties for many pedestrians.""

He said the consultation would look at a variety of options, including giving local authorities extended powers to crack down on this behaviour.

Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the transport committee, welcomed the consultation, noting that the government had promised in 2015 to look into the issue but consultations and reviews had failed to improve roadside conditions.

""This government has signalled an intent to finally deliver change,"" he said, adding that detailed timings were needed.

London's ban

Image copyright Getty Images

While ministers consider outlawing pavement parking across England, a ban has been in place in London since 1974.

One of its main aims is to prevent pedestrians, including wheelchair users, people with baby buggies and the visually impaired, from being obstructed.

But it is also about limiting damage to footways - unlike roads, pavements are not designed to take the weight of vehicles.

The rules apply to almost all streets in London at all times, and those who flout them can be given a parking ticket of up to £100 and be towed away - even if just one or two wheels are parked on the footway.

Exceptions to the ban include vehicles that have been exempted by councils and for unloading or loading when there is no other method available.

It is a widespread issue - a YouGov survey in 2018 found 65% of drivers admitted to having previously parked on the pavement.

'Unintended consequences'

The AA said it agreed that people who park in an anti-social way should be penalised.

But it added: ""An outright ban could lead to unintended consequences with parking chaos becoming more widespread.

""A better solution would be for councils to make a street-by-street assessment and where pavement parking could be allowed it be clearly marked and signed.""

Last year, Scotland became the first country in the UK to legislate against pavement parking. The ban comes into place in 2021.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51844446,BBC,Politics,True
366,"['Leo Kelion', 'Technology Desk Editor']",Apps 'must check images for child abuse before publication',"Image copyright Getty Images

Internet companies must do more to tackle ""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuse on their platforms, a UK-held inquiry has concluded.

The panel also said the technology companies had ""failed to demonstrate"" they were fully aware of the number of under-13s using their services and lacked a plan to combat the problem.

It has called for all images to be screened before publication.

And it said more stringent age checks were also required.

'Reputational damage'

Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were identified as the most commonly cited apps where grooming was said to take place.

And the industry at large was accused of being ""reactive rather than proactive"" in response to the issues.

""Action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children,"" the inquiry said.

The report follows a series of public hearings, between January 2018 and May 2019, during which the police said they believed the UK was the world's third biggest consumer of live-streamed child sex abuse.

'Evil crime'

Facebook was one of the first to respond.

""[We] have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions,"" said its European head of safety, David Miles.

""As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe.""

Microsoft also promised to ""consider these findings carefully"", while Google said it would keep working with others to ""tackle this evil crime"".

Illegal imagery

The report said some steps should be taken before the end of September.

Leading its list is a requirement for screening before images appear online.

The report noted technologies such as Microsoft's PhotoDNA had made it possible for pictures to be quickly checked against databases of known illegal imagery without humans needing to look at them.

But at present, this filtering process typically happened after the material had already become available for others to see.

Officially banned

Users might be frustrated by a delay in seeing their content go live but, the panel said, it had not been told of any technical reason this process could not happen before publication.

The inquiry also said the UK government should introduce legislation to compel the companies involved to adopt more effective checks to deter under-age users.

Pre-teens were at ""particularly acute"" risk of being groomed, it said.

The panel recognised many services were officially banned to under-13s.

Child nudity

But it said in many cases, the only test was to require users to fill in a date-of-birth form, which could easily be falsified.

""There must be better means of ensuring compliance,"" it said.

The report acknowledged detecting and preventing the live-streaming of abuse was difficult but highlighted a French app as an example to learn from.

It said Yubo used algorithms to detect possible instances of child nudity, which a human moderator would then check to see if action if necessary.

Image copyright Yubo Image caption It was suggested the big social networks could learn from a smaller rival, Yubo

The panel also noted existing anti-abuse technologies did not work when communications were protected by end-to-end encryption, which digitally scrambles communications without giving platform providers a key.

The inquiry highlighted WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage and FaceTime already used the technique by default and Facebook intended to deploy it more widely soon.

However, it did not say how this should be addressed.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51851921,BBC,Politics,True

The Six Nations match between Wales and Scotland should be called off, Plaid Cymru has said.

Leader Adam Price called for all mass gathering events should be postponed or cancelled.

The safety of citizens ""must be put before everything else"", Mr Price said.

But Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said advice cancelling events would not make a difference in saving lives.

However he said a recommendation the Scottish Government has made, that large events should not go ahead from next week, is also being considered in Wales.

Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said that, from Friday, people with symptoms of a new cough or fever would be asked to self-isolate for seven days as part of an escalated response to the coronavirus.

Plaid earlier cancelled its own spring party conference, due to be held on 20-21 March in Llangollen.

Welsh Labour and the Liberal Democrats also announced they have cancelled their conferences.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has recommended that mass events involving more than 500 people should not go ahead from next week.

Mark Reckless, Brexit Party group leader in the assembly, called for all schools in Wales to be closed from Monday.

""I recognise the disruption this will cause, but I believe social distancing should begin sooner rather than later, and that doing so now may make a significant difference to the rate of infection and save lives,"" he said.

Adam Price said: ""The safety of our citizens - including the most vulnerable and at risk of coronavirus, must be put before everything else.""

He called for the Welsh Government to take ""urgent and aggressive action"" rather ""than waiting for instruction from London"".

They should consider instructing public sector workers to work from home, whether schools should break up early for Easter, the party leader said.

""All mass gatherings and events should be postponed or cancelled with immediate effect - that would mean no indoor gatherings larger than 100 and no outdoor gathering larger than 500.""

Earlier Plaid Cymru said cancelling its conference ""is the most responsible course of action for the party to take in the current circumstances.""

Conservative assembly member Andrew RT Davies said postponing the Wales-Scotland match was ""surely the sensible move"".

Image caption Vaughan Gething said opposition parties should take a ""responsible approach""

In a robust response, Mr Gething told a press conference that politicians, including those in the opposition, should take a ""responsible approach"" and should not try to suggest ""there is public health advice to take a step when actually it does not exist"".

""The challenge about larger events is that the science doesn't tell us it really makes a difference either in significantly delaying the peak of the outbreak or indeed in terms of saving life.""

However, he said that the Scottish Government view on larger events may be taken by Welsh Government. ""That is something we are actively considering. And we may make the same decision next week as well.""

He said the Scottish Government was thinking about the impact on emergency services.

'Think carefully'

The Labour event was to be held from 27 to 29 March.

Welsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""At a time when the whole Welsh Labour Government is focused on responding to the major challenge of coronavirus, I have decided it would not be right for members of the Welsh Government to be taken away from those duties.

""I look forward to the conference being rescheduled.

""The Welsh Government is not at present suggesting cancellation of other events in Wales but do advise everyone to think carefully if they represent the best use of time and resources in the current context.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-51853674,BBC,Politics,True
368,,Budget 2020: Chancellor pumps billions into economy to combat coronavirus,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The chancellor says his 2020 Budget offers the “largest sustained fiscal boost for nearly 30 years”

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a £30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak.

He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding.

In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together.""

The Bank of England has announced an emergency cut in interest rates.

Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus.

""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs.

Of the £30bn in extra spending, £12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least £5bn for the NHS in England and £7bn for business and workers across the UK.

This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to £18bn next year, and even more in following years.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around £100bn to public borrowing by 2024.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, which has now been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts.

Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include:

Statutory sick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate"" even if they have not displayed symptoms

Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below £51,000 suspended for a year

A £500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas

A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to £1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses

The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus

Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts

Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres

The number of coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus.

The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"".

The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving £6bn over the next five years.

The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts.

The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn.

In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year.

A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled and duties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more.

The so-called tampon tax will be abolished, and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journals will be scrapped from 1 December.

And the chancellor pledged to more than double spending on UK government research and development by 2024.

The chancellor announced more than £600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projects over five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England.

He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"".

He also promised an additional £640m for the Scottish government, £360m for the Welsh government, £210m for the Northern Ireland executive and £240m for new city and growth deals.

Mr Sunak said he was providing £200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences.

The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January.

369,,Budget 2020: McDonnell criticises government for offering 'nothing on social care',"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McDonnell: I'm absolutely worried about social care

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the government's Budget has offered ""nothing"" to tackle the ""social care crisis"".

He told the BBC it would be difficult to ""rebuild"" social care services to cope with the coronavirus outbreak.

He said he was ""worried"" about the future, but he welcomed extra funding to help the NHS.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social care will get ""everything it needs"" to respond to the outbreak.

Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced at least £5bn this year for the NHS in England to help it cope with the spread of the virus.

Mr Hancock told MPs the extra cash was for ""social care too"", telling MPs that adult social care ""will be at the front line of our response"".

It comes after Mr Hancock wrote to MPs last week to start cross-party talks to find a long-term solution on how social care should be funded.

The talks were a pledge in the Conservative election manifesto, which also promised an extra £1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years.

According to NHS Digital, 841,850 people were receiving long-term care in England in 2018. An ageing population is expected to increase demand.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Neil Show, Mr McDonnell said he would support any ""effective"" plan to emerge from the talks.

But he accused ministers of having failed to ""seriously"" acknowledge pressures faced by the sector, and failing to ""learn the lessons"" from budget cuts to public services over the last 10 years.

""There's nothing for social care today,"" he added, referring to the Budget.

""If you don't tackle the social care crisis, we're going to have real problems - not just immediately but for the long-term future"".

Earlier, former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted he failed to solve issues relating to social care whilst in office.

Writing on Twitter, he added that the sector ""desperately"" needed a long-term plan to go alongside the 10-year NHS England blueprint unveiled last year.

""Hospitals will continue to fill up, and the winter crisis will be annual until we fix this issue,"" he added.

'Astounding omission'

Speaking after the Budget was delivered, acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the spending plans did not do ""anything"" for social care.

""We have a care sector on its knees. Care homes are closing and there are shortages of care staff,"" he said.

""It is an astounding omission.""

Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund think tank, said adult social care remained a ""pressing and overlooked"" issue.

He added that it was ""hugely disappointing"" the Budget ""does not include an emergency cash injection to help local government to address social care needs beyond coronavirus.""

Social care is a devolved issue. In Scotland, the SNP has said if it is re-elected in 2021 it would scrap all non-residential social care charges.

371,,Coronavirus: Five ways hospitals will change to tackle the pandemic,"Image copyright Getty Images

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has braced the UK for ""quite extraordinary interventions that you don't normally have in peacetime"" to combat the coronavirus pandemic. But what are these interventions and how will they change the NHS?

1. Hotel room or hospital ward?

Image copyright Steve Parsons/PA Wire Image caption A Holiday Inn hotel near Heathrow Airport has been reserved by the government for people arriving from abroad to self-isolate

The health secretary said empty hotels across the country would help ease the pressure on hospitals that are filling up with patients.

""Some people are saying: 'Should you build a hospital?'"" Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

""Actually, we've seen that many hotels are empty so we've got ready-built facilities for looking after people.""

Asked about whether military field hospitals might also be used to spread the load, Mr Hancock said: ""I'm open to all options.""

He said he was more concerned that enough staff members and equipment were available to cope with an influx in patients, rather than worrying about where those patients would go to receive care.

""The critical thing is that [the hotels] need oxygen supply and the ventilation equipment - whether it's the invasive ventilation or just the mask on your face.

""So what matters is not just the space, it's making sure that the equipment and the trained staff are there as well.""

Hotel chain Best Western said it was considering turning some of its properties into temporary hospitals to help the NHS.

Chief executive Rob Paterson said Best Western would discuss the idea this week and ""would be willing to take unprecedented steps to support the national effort"".

The chain reported an increase in cancellations over the last month as a result of the pandemic.

2. NHS or private hospital?

The Labour Party and the GMB union have called on the government to use empty beds in ""plush private hospitals"" to ease the pressure on the NHS.

Downing Street confirmed on Sunday that the health service would buy up thousands of beds in private hospitals if they were needed to cope with a surge in patient numbers.

The government said ""negotiations"" with private healthcare providers have already begun.

But the GMB union is calling for these beds to be given to the NHS for free.

""This is a public health emergency, not a business opportunity for shoddy private healthcare chums to profiteer from distress,"" said GMB's Rehana Azam.

3. Ventilators made at car factories

How will thousands of new ventilators - machines needed to help patients breathe - be made quickly enough to cope with an increase in demand?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available in the UK at the moment but that many times that number would be needed as the number of people with Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, increased.

Asked if the likes of military engineers and car manufacturers would be asked to meet the demand, the health secretary said: ""Yes, we're talking to all those companies.""

""We've got high quality engineering in this country. And we want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators to do that,"" he added.

The speedy manufacturing might not stop once the UK has enough ventilators either, with Mr Hancock suggesting the equipment could be sent abroad to help other countries in need.

Digger manufacturing company JCB confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if they could help to make ventilators.

Chairman Lord Bamford said the British company - which cut production and working hours in February as coronavirus led to a shortage of components - would do ""whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing"".

The cancellation of swathes of non-urgent - or ""elective"" - surgery will help to free up space, Mr Hancock said.

He said the sorts of operations that could be delayed ""in this emergency"" situation included hip and knee operations.

Operating theatres where these procedures are normally carried out are equipped with oxygen supplies, meaning they ""can be turned into wards"" for coronavirus patients.

373,"['Marco Silva', 'In-Depth Reporting On Social Media']",General election 2019: What's the evidence that Russia interfered?,"A leak of confidential UK government documents in the run-up to last December's general election has been blamed on Russian actors. But what evidence is there to say the Russian government itself tried to interfere in British politics?

With just about two weeks to go before election day, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn revealed a trove of confidential documents outlining talks between UK and US officials about a possible future trade deal.

The leak fuelled a debate about the future of the NHS and made the headlines for days, particularly after evidence emerged blaming Russians for the leak.

But a key question remains unanswered, three months after the vote: Was the Russian government directly involved?

Reddit and the elusive 'Gregoratior'

The 451-page trove of documents first emerged online in October.

A user going by the name ""Gregoratior"" posted a link to the documents on discussion website Reddit, suggesting the publication would ""make some noise"".

Image copyright Reddit

It didn't at first: only a small number of Reddit users noticed the post and commented on it.

On Twitter, politicians and journalists also failed to immediately notice the leak, despite repeated attempts by a Twitter account, again with the handle ""Gregoratior"", to get their attention. Since then, the account has been suspended.

Listen to our investigation 'Did Russia leak British secrets online?'

With less than a week to go before the election, Reddit released a statement linking the ""Gregoratior"" account to a known disinformation campaign coming out of Russia.

The website banned the account, along with 60 other related accounts suspected of misusing the platform and engaging in what they called ""influence operations"".

We asked Reddit if we could examine the evidence the company holds linking these accounts to Russian operators - but they declined to show us.

Image copyright Press Association Image caption Jeremy Corbyn: ""At no stage did the prime minister or anybody deny that those documents were real""

It also remains unclear how the Labour Party got hold of the leaked documents. At the time, they did not reveal their source, and they did not respond to BBC Trending's recent requests for comment.

At the time of the leak, Mr Corbyn described suggestions that Labour might have benefited from a Russian operation as ""nonsense"".

'Operation Secondary Infektion'

But there is stronger evidence pointing to the involvement of Russian hackers - albeit not conclusive proof that the Kremlin itself is involved.

Last year, Facebook shut down dozens of accounts, pages and groups run from Russia for engaging in what the company described as ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"".

They were linked to what the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank, would later identify as ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" - a disinformation campaign stemming from Russia.

Through a network of bogus social media accounts, this campaign tried to spread forged documents and false news stories that, according to DFRLab, ""attacked Western interests and unity"".

Image copyright FunnyJunk.com Image caption Among the forged stories were suggestions that Spanish intelligence was aware of a Remainer plot to kill Boris Johnson

Often translated into several languages, many of these stories were published on websites open to contributions from the public.

When the leak of UK-US trade documents hit the headlines, open-source investigators noticed how the files were published and distributed online. Soon, the similarities with ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" became evident.

""The tradecraft was absolutely identical,"" says Ben Nimmo, who worked on the original DFRLab report and is currently head of investigations at US company Graphika.

Nimmo outlined the similarities between the earlier operation and the UK leaks in a report released in December.

""The same type of pages were being used, similar username strategies were being used,"" says Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""It either is an actor who is replicating these efforts or it is the same actor.""

Image copyright Reddit Image caption Another forged story which was part of the operation suggested the Real IRA had posted an Arabic-language invitation to Islamist fighters online

There was however one key difference: while ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" spread false stories based on forged documents - often clear and preposterous fakes - the ""Gregoratior"" leak of trade talk documents seems authentic.

The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, but no government official has yet denounced them as forgeries.

""The big question is still: How did internal UK government documents end up on Reddit in the first place?"" says Mr Nimmo.

Due to the possibility that hackers may have been involved in gaining access to the documents, the National Cyber Security Centre is currently investigating.

Moscow denies involvement in leaks

While the evidence points back to Russian territory, it is far more difficult to determine who specifically was carrying out the operation and, more importantly, on whose orders.

""It was sophisticated, it was well resourced,"" says Mr Nimmo. ""The likeliest candidate is either some form of Russian state operator or some proxy of the Russian state operators."" But he and several other experts stop short of drawing a definitive line to the Russian government.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference

""Yes, Russia does have that strategy in their playbook,"" Ms Neudert says. ""But it could also be private actors, some sort of hacker collective, it could be some sort of tech-savvy trolling... There are many kinds of actors that are hacking private information.""

The Russian Embassy in London denied any links to either ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" or the leak of UK-US trade documents.

Other experts warned that an exclusive focus on Russia could deflect attention from other campaigns.

""Russia has a habit of trying to interfere in western countries' elections,"" says Elisabeth Braw, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. ""They are extremely good at corrupting our public discourse.""

""But we have a situation where it's very easy to blame Russia,"" Ms Braw says. ""That is extremely dangerous, because we neglect to examine the activities of other countries that want to weaken our societies, such as China, North Korea, or Iran.""

In October, the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee completed a report outlining the various ways in which Russia has recently tried to interfere with British democracy.

Downing Street delayed the publication of the report, prompting accusations that it might be trying to suppress its key conclusions. Number 10 denies the accusation and says a normal timetable has been followed.

Publication is now expected later this year, once a new Intelligence and Security Committee has been appointed.

374,"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']",Coronavirus: What next in the UK coronavirus fight?,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

376,['Press Trust Of India'],"No timeline to remove income tax exemptions, says Nirmala Sitharaman","Finance Minister on Sunday said the idea behind introducing second alternative tax slabs sans exemptions was to take the country towards “a simplified, exemption-free, and reduced rate of tax regime”.

There was, however, no time frame set by the government to remove all exemptions, she told reporters after an interactive session with trade representatives and intellectuals on the Union Budget.

“At the moment we only started a second alternative with some exemptions removed or some exemptions included, although the original intention was to remove all exemptions and give a clear simplified reduced rate of income tax,” the finance minister said.

The Budget has introduced more tax slabs and offers higher limits provided the taxpayer is ready to forego all the existing exemptions and deductions including home loan interest, other tax savings investments. “We have not made up our minds as yet (on the removal of all exemptions)... We are trying step by step, move forward and no particular timeline given,” she said.

Addressing a post-Budget press meet on February 1, Sitharaman had said the government intended to remove all I-T exemptions in the long run.

On Sunday, she said based on a simulation and assumption, 69 per cent of taxpayers would have benefitted and probably 11 per cent would have been “attracted” had the new tax regime been introduced last year.

When asked about the Supreme Court order on telecom companies’ payment of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and the concerns expressed by some bankers, Sitharaman said it may not be proper for her to comment on the matter as there is a Ministry concerned looking into it. “The concerned ministry is looking into it. So, it may not be proper for me to comment on it,” the minister said.

To a query on allegations by the Telangana government that there was a decline in devolution of funds to states from the Centre, she said the allocation is followed as per the recommendations of the Finance commissions and it is not true that the centre is not cooperating with states.

‘FRBM not breached’



The finance minister said the Budget was prepared keeping the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) in mind even as she maintained she would be remembered for presenting the “longest prepared Budget” than for “longest speech” on it.

“So in a way all these (measures) and more have been done that the FRBM, as an Act, we have to keep in mind and also comply with it. So we have not really breached the FRBM. We have not gone outlandish on it. We have kept fiscal discipline, which is a USP for both the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and also for the Shri Narendra Modi government,” she said.

The Centre had earlier said it was committed to reducing fiscal deficit — the gap between total expenditure and revenue — to 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2020-21 and eliminate the primary deficit as per the FRBM Act.

The government has utilised ‘escape clause’ under the FRBM Act, which allows the Centre to breach its fiscal deficit target by 0.5 percentage points at times of severe stress in the economy, including periods of structural change and when growth falls sharply.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/no-timeline-to-remove-income-tax-exemptions-says-nirmala-sitharaman-120021600696_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True
377,['Press Trust Of India'],"Budget disappointing; but fiscal, taxation measures welcome: EAC member","The Union Budget was ""disappointing"" as it lacked a vision, though measures like relaxing the fiscal deficit target and simplifying income tax are positives, the PM's economic advisory council member Ashima Goyal has said.

Goyal, who is a part-time member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), also said that it was a ""surprise"" not to have a mention of the word 'slowdown' in the nearly three-hour long speech by Finance Minister

The budget document is a ""balancing act"" between fiscal stimulus to drive growth and the need to be responsible on spending, she said at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research here over the weekend.

""Overall it (Budget) was disappointing because they didn't bring out the vision as a first real budget of a new government. It had to give a vision,"" the eminent economist said.

India's GDP growth is expected to slip to a decadal low of 5 per cent this fiscal, pressured by domestic factors like drop in consumption, as well as global issues.

""Surprising thing is that coming at a time when everybody is disturbed about a slowdown, the word slowdown is not used at all in almost three-hour long speech. There was no discussion on how the Budget is going to attack slowdown,"" Goyal said.

She further said Sitharaman was in a ""catch-22"" situation from the word go in the Budget making process, wherein any action would have left someone unhappy.

However, the finance minister has achieved a ""balancing act"" through her moves, Goyal said.

She elaborated that by adopting the 'exit clause' under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, the government gave a stimulus to growth and yet affirmed commitment to rules against fiscal profligacy.

To drive the point further, she said a 0.5 percentage point relaxation in fiscal deficit target offered under the exit clause makes lot of resources available, considering that the overall size of the economy is nearly USD 3 trillion.

Goyal also welcomed the government's resolve not to adopt policies similar to the response following the 2008 financial crisis.

She said in 2008-09, the fiscal deficit had gone up by 4 percentage points and the interest rates were also taken to record lows to stimulate growth.

There is also an attempt by the government to direct expenditure more towards capital expenditure, which suggests that the quality of the fiscal deficit is better now.

The Budget also has other positives like the ones on taxation, where there is greater focus on trust and simplification, she said, welcoming the debated moves on exemptions.

The government's moves on frontloading expenditure to early part of the fiscal year will also help, she said.

The measures on helping smaller non-bank lenders will prop up the economy as liquidity is still an issue for lot of players in the system, she noted.

The government has been ""opportunistic"" on the transparency front, she said, adding that credibility has been added by stating the off-budget borrowings through entities like the Food Corporation of India.

On banks' reluctance to pass on RBI's rate cuts, she cited pressure from both the elevated small savings interest rates and also the dependence of a large population on interest income.

""We are not willing as an economy to move to a lower interest rate, lower inflation economy,"" she said.

On the resource mobilisation front, she acknowledged that people are getting ""cynical"" with the privatisation targets after a massive under-performance on this front in FY20, but seemed to suggest that work already undertaken, like in the case of Air India, will reap revenues.

Meanwhile, she also flagged implementation issues on the budgetary targets, suggesting that the revenue increase targets are very high.

""The objective of kick-starting growth and building growth momentum which does not seem to have been addressed effectively in the Budget. Infrastructure investments in roads, railways and metros have been the major planks of infrastructure investment by the government.

""If the Government intended to keep these two companies mortally sick but on ventilator, more transparent way would have been to pay this as grant and not as capital expenditure,"" he said.

The also said that the ministry will come out with detailed rules on its direct tax resolution scheme in a couple of days. This will provide clarity to those who are keen to settle their tax disputes under the scheme.

Changes to the Budget are made when the Finance Bill comes up for discussion which will happen after Parliament reconvenes post the recess next month.

Industry sought clarity on taxes on real estate investment trusts (REITs), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), dividend tax, employees stock options (ESOPs) and real estate, among others.

The amended direct tax resolution or Vivad Se Vishwas Bill is yet to be tabled in Parliament and then enacted. As such, the rules under the Bill would not be in the form of a notification, Sitharaman said.

She said the details will give a clear picture to what the notification will contain once the Bill is passed by Parliament.

“In a day or two, we will be coming out with a clear non-paper (on the scheme) because Parliament is yet to pass it,” she said.

She told consultants from Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers, among others, that they will have time to look at these and tell their clients what will come out. “You will get 30 days or three weeks before the Bill is passed,” the told the consultants.

Recently, the Cabinet okayed expanding the scope of the Bill called Vivad Se Vishwas to make it more attractive. The ambit will include litigation pending in arbitration forums and debt recovery tribunals (DRTs). The scheme will also include cases related to revision and small-value search disputes.

The Cabinet also sweetened the scheme by reducing the disputed amount by half for those assessees who got favourable orders, but the income tax department challenged those.

Sitharaman has already introduced the Bill in the Lok Sabha to resolve disputed tax cases, amounting to Rs 9.3 trillion, giving effect to the Budget announcement.

The scheme offers waiver of interest, penalty, and prosecution for settling tax disputes. It was earlier limited to cases pending before the commissioner (appeals), the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, high courts or the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2020. Now, a complete waiver of interest and penalty will be given if tax dues are paid by March 31. An additional 10 per cent of the disputed amount will have to be paid after that. To queries on employees stock option provisions in the Budget for start-ups, the finance minister said she is willing to know the opinion of the industry whether to treat ESOPs as salary or perk and how it should be taxed.

Although, the UP Annual Budget 2019-20 tabled on February 7, 2019 was to the tune of Rs 4.79 trillion, the total size of the state budget for the current financial year burgeoned to about Rs 4.96 trillion after the tabling of two supplementary budgets in the legislature on July 23 and December 17, 2019 of Rs 13,595 crore and Rs 4,210 crore respectively.

As such, the size of the UP Annual Budget 2020-21 is expected to breach the historic mark of Rs 5 trillion, when it is tabled next week.

The government is working on various ongoing and proposed expressway projects viz. Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway and Ganga Expressway, apart from other infrastructure projects, such as Jewar International Airport, Greater Noida and UP Defence Corridor. Therefore, the Budget is likely to allocate funds towards these flagship projects, since they are aimed at attaining full or part operational status before the next UP elections in 2022.

Meanwhile, the Adityanath government today held an all party meeting seeking the support of all the political parties in the smooth conduct of the two houses of the UP legislature viz. Vidhan Sabha (Lower House) and Vidhan Parishad (Upper House).

However, the opposition, including Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress will nevertheless attack the BJP dispensation on the people’s issues of alleged farm distress, deteriorating law and order, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic development etc.

Besides, the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) are seen as the fulcrum around which the opposition will take the government to task, and indirectly target the Narendra Modi government at the Centre.

Meanwhile, it would be the first time when UP Governor Anandiben Patel will preside over the Annual Budget Session after taking over the gubernatorial post last year from her predecessor Ram Naik.

In the second Supplementary Budget for 2019-20 tabled in December 2019, the Adityanath government had allocated Rs 1,700 crore to the industries department for the various infrastructure projects. Rs 960 crore was given to the UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) for the prepayment of loan HUDCO loan sourced for Purvanchal Expressway.

Besides, Rs 500 crore and Rs 200 crore was allocated for Purvanchal Expressway and Bundelkhand Expressway respectively. Rs 1,000 crore was provided to the energy department for different projects and settlement of liabilities.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/uttar-pradesh-annual-budget-session-2020-21-to-begin-on-thursday-120021201339_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True
381,['Avishek Rakshit'],ITC is first to hike cigarette prices post budget; makes them 10-20% dearer,"Following the hike in the National Calamity Contingency Duty (NCCD) announced in the Union Budget this year, market leader increased prices by 10-20 per cent across some of its brands in all of its markets.

A rise in NCCD escalates taxes on cigarettes. Manufacturers have the option to either pass it on the consumer or absorb it.

""Prices of a number of brands have been revised,"" an spokesperson said.

This is the first hike in cigarettes after the Budget.

Sources said while the American Club Cool Fresh Taste saw the minimum hike of 10 per cent, from Rs 200 to Rs 220 for a pack of 20 cigarettes, the price of Navy Cut Filter rose by about 16 per cent, at Rs 80 for a pack of 10 sticks. Flake Filter has become costlier by 14 per cent at Rs 80, while prices of Flake Special Filter, Flake Blue Special Filter and Wave Cool Mint rose by 20 per cent.

Other brands that suffered a price rise were Gold Flake Super Star and Duke Special Filter.

Incidentally, it is one of the steepest price upsurges took in the past 2-3 years. Last year, the firm increased the prices of Bristol, Capstan and Flake Excel by 7-14 per cent and also introduced hikes in some regional brands while in 2017, prices rose by 6-7 per cent across brands.

However, in 2016, the company took selective price increases across its cigarettes portfolio pass on the excise increase, making Classic and Gold Flake Kings brands more expensive by 13 per cent. In the year before prices went up by 12-21 per cent.

The hike this time exceeded the previously anticipated surge of 7-10 per cent which sector analysts were expecting after NCCD was revised.

Analysts reasoned that on a blended basis, there is likely to be an 11 per cent tax hike on the average as the dominant 64 mm (mini king size) has seen a sharper tax hike of 15 per cent while others like the king size and regular sizes have seen tax hike of 9-10 per cent.

According to Abneesh Roy, executive vice president of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities, a seven per cent hike would have led to a 3-4 per cent decline in volumes.

The previous projection, however, is likely to be revised now.

ITC, which commands the leadership position in the cigarettes space with a 3/4th market share, has been raising concerns over the stress on its cigarettes business prompted by taxation and illicit trade.

After its third quarter results, ITC said that while the company continues to augment its product portfolio, “extremely stringent regulations along with a punitive and discriminatory taxation regime on cigarettes in recent years have had numerous negative, albeit unintended repercussions”.

It said that such a course has resulted in decline in legal volumes in favour of lightly taxed and tax-evaded tobacco products. Moreover, the absence of mandatory pictorial warnings on illegally traded cigarettes in the country has also added to the stress on the legal cigarette industry.

ITC also raised concerns that there has been widespread availability of illegal cigarettes and other tobacco products of dubious quality and hygiene to consumers at extremely affordable prices.

After its results for the third quarter of the current fiscal year, ITC said that the performance during the quarter reflects the persistent weakness in the overall demand environment, especially in rural markets and wholesale channel, tight market liquidity conditions and the increasing salience of illicit trade especially at the premium end.

During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, ITC posted a 6.31 per cent rise in its income from cigarettes, at Rs 17,928.69 crore, while profit from cigarette sales rose by 7.59 per cent to Rs 12,188.58 crore.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/itc-is-first-to-hike-cigarette-prices-post-budget-makes-them-10-20-dearer-120021101540_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

“The economy is strong, foreign exchange reserves are at its highest, and investments from abroad continue steadily,” Sitharaman said while interacting with economists, traders, and industry associations at an event in Chennai.

“We are sound in macroeconomics. Even though there are discussions on whether the economic growth has come down to 5 (per cent) or 6 (per cent) from 8 per cent, our base is as strong as it was when there was 8 per cent growth. If not, will foreign exchange reserves be at the current level? They are higher than ever. Similarly, foreign direct investment is the highest ever. If it (the government’s work) is being criticised with a good intend to improve performance, it is good. We will return to 8 per cent growth,” she said.

She said people who blamed Prime Minister for growth falling from 8 per cent to 5 per cent should consider that industries were coming to India like never before. “When international markets are fluctuating, and and the US-China trade war are impacting the markets, if one Budget has been able to maintain all the three markets at good levels, it is the government’s Budget,” she said.

She was referring to the performance of the equity, bond and currency markets since the Budget presentation on February 1. She said the government had responsibly used public funds, unlike the previous Congress-led governments that gave bank loans to “uncles and brothers-in-law” when the economy was slowing down in 2008-2010.

Sitharaman said goods and services tax (GST) collections were growing as the government was taking help of improved technology and plugging the loopholes. She said during the past three months, GST collections had exceeded Rs 1 trillion.

Ajay Bhushan Pandey, revenue secretary, said new individual income-tax proposals would help taxpayers in many ways. He said the Vivad se Viswas scheme was expected to get passed by Parliament this month and an electronic interface would be introduced where taxpayers could find out the details of their dispute and apply instantly for a settlement.

AIPEF's national executive is meeting at Chennai on Sunday to decide on the future course of action, which could include work boycott.

“These old thermal power stations provide the cheapest source of electricity. After these plants are shut, the power distribution companies would be compelled to procure costly electricity from private producers and pass on the increased tariff burden to the consumers,” Dubey claimed.

Foreign exchange earnings in tourism sector has grown from Rs 1.75 trillion to Rs 1.88 trillion between January and November 2019. Factoring in the encouraging FDI inflows and outbound Indian tourist splurge on foreign travel, tourism promotion deserved a higher allocation, the industry body felt.

“We had already brought to the notice of the Union finance ministry that Rs 9,000 crore is being spent by Indians traveling abroad on holidays because India is lacking infrastructure required for the tourism sector. More good hotels at iconic destinations and domestic tourist locations are not available within the country and do not have sufficient hotels. It was proposed to give incentives up to three-star category hotels to enable Indian hospitality sector to compete with neighbouring countries to make tourism a major foreign exchange earning source for the country,” said J K Mohanty, secretary, HAI and chairman (eastern region), Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO).

HAI welcomed the Budgetary announcement of developing five archaeological sites at Rakhigarhi in Haryana, Hastinapur in Uttar Pradesh, Sivasagar in Assam, Dholavira in Gujarat and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu, stating that iconic sites with on-site museums will definitely help the tourism sector. However, it lamented the omission of sites of historical and religious import in Odisha such as Sun Temple at Konark, Jagannath Temple at Puri and Dhauli, the seat of Buddhist peace pagoda on Bhubaneswar's periphery.

Flagging the positives in the Budget for the tourism sector, HAI lauded the Government's decision to pledge Rs 100 trillion for infrastructure and creating a national infrastructure pipeline by improving railways, airports, national highways, train connectivity to iconic tourist destinations improving water ways by connecting rivers and building 100 more airports to support UDAN scheme.

“Further, the grant of Rs 1.7 trillion to the transport infrastructure sector would definitely have positive impact on tourism sector. The declaration of the new Economy for Data Center Parks in PPP (public private partnership) mode and digital connectivity of 100,000 gram panchayats through Bharat Link, for which Rs 6,000 crore has been provided made will definitely improve connectivity and have a positive impact on the tourism industry,” said Mohanty, who is also the chairman of Hotel & Restaurant Association of Odisha (HRAO).

The that for several months remained in the comfort zone of the central bank has started inching up and crossed the 7 per cent mark during December 2019, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables.

Experts said the MPC members are going to have a tough time as slowing economy makes the case for reduction in repo rate, while rising inflation and higher fiscal deficit will require the central bank to either hike the rate or maintain a status quo.

The sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2019-20 will be announced at 1145 hours on Thursday.

While upholding the AGR definition of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), SC had in October 2019 asked telcos to pay up past dues estimated at Rs 1.47 trillion within three months. The industry plea, seeking a modification of the order to get more time for paying up the dues, is yet to be heard in the top court.

“The AGR dues have not been factored in by the government in its Union Budget as the matter is sub-judice,” said economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty on the sidelines of the post-Budget-Ficci event on Monday. He said the AGR dues have not been accounted for either in the current financial year or the next. “We want to be on the conservative side while budgeting our revenues,” he added.

In the latest Budget, the government has estimated a revenue of Rs 1.33 trillion from telecom services in 2020-21. This is around Rs 74,000 crore more than the Rs 58,989 crore it expects to earn in the present financial year.

The government hasn’t specified the avenues from which Rs 1.33 trillion can be realised in the telecom sector.

It is either an ambitious target or the government would look for alternative resources, said analysts.

Besides AGR dues, spectrum auction across bands, scheduled for this year, would yield revenues. However, the financially stressed telecom companies are unlikely to bid aggressively in the auction.

Even after the SC deadline for paying up the AGR dues expired on January 23, the DoT did not take any coercive action against the defaulters as their appeals seeking relaxation in payment timelines is pending in the apex court.

The figure of Rs 1.33 trillion under the telecom head in the Budget raised apprehensions among telecom operators that they may have to pay a substantial portion of the AGR dues — over 50 per cent of Rs 1.47 trillion — in the next fiscal year.

According to Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) estimates, telcos have to pay around Rs 16,000 to Rs 17,000 crore as licence fee and spectrum usage charge (SUC) this year.

Even after assuming that revenues will grow sharply due to increase in tariffs and redefinition of AGR, they say it cannot be more than Rs 30,000 crore for FY21. But with a moratorium of two years on payment of deferred spectrum for FY21, which is Rs 25,000 crore, this money will not be available.

390,"['Shreya Jai', 'Amritha Pillay']",Power industry hails proposal for smart prepaid metering across the country,"The proposal for smart prepaid metering across the country in three years, announced in the Union Budget last week, has been hailed by the power industry. But the initiative is not new. The power ministry has been planning it for the past two years, but with limited success. At the same time, many hurdles await the ambitious plan.

In her Budget speech on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman said, “The ministry intends to promote smart metering. I urge all states and Union territories to replace conventional energy meters with prepaid smart meters in the next three years,” she said on Saturday.

Two years back, R K Singh, Union Minister for Power, said his ministry was planning to convert all meters in the country to smart prepaid meters. In an interview to Business Standard in 2018, Singh had said he would mandate state-owned power distribution companies (discoms) to switch to smart prepaid meters.

“Smart, because we are aiming at ‘time of the day’ tariff. Prepaid, because it improves bill collection and efficiency. It is pro-poor as well. Consumers can charge as many times as they wish. They will not face disconnection. It is good for discoms as they will get payment in advance,” he had said then.

Since then, 400,000 smart meters have been installed to date in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. These were by Energy Efficiency Services, which is mandated for smart meters tendering to private companies. Close to 5 million were tendered in the first round.

Responding to the announcement in the Budget, the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers Association (IEEMA) said this is a positive step and the industry will fully cooperate with the government in meeting the target.

“Installing smart prepaid meters will improve the cash flows and revenue of discoms. Going by the government’s commitment to promote Make In India, it should also ensure indigenous meter makers are preferred over imported ones. With smart prepaid meters come data and cybersecurity risks. Hence, indigenous products should be given priority,” said Sunil Mishra, director general, IEEMA.

Despite the ambitious target, there is, however, no budgetary allocation or grant to smart metering in the Union Budget.

Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director for Tata Power, called smart metering push a ‘knee-jerk reaction’. “The government needs to first address distribution reforms. Smart meters on their own will not give much benefit,” said Sinha. He further added, once other distribution-related technologies are in place, smart meters will bring in great value.

Several industry players also highlighted that the investment needed under this ambitious plan would come from the private sector and hence, there needs to be a comprehensive policy. “The plan would need close to ~1-1.5 trillion of investment and five-seven years for implementation. There is no guiding policy yet on smart meters,” said an executive of a leading meter company.

He said a common policy should be enforced for all states with rules on payment security, data security, operation and maintenance. “To start with, all state and state electricity regulatory boards should be on board and agree to a unified policy,” he said.

A smart prepaid meter has a modem (communication device) and a remote switch by which demand, supply, and billing can be monitored and controlled remotely. The data from the meter is collected in a cloud server. This reduces energy theft, improves billing and bill collection. It also helps discoms collect the data of consumer demand patterns, which, in turn, can be used to plan supply.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/power-industry-hails-proposal-for-smart-prepaid-metering-across-the-country-120020301438_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

An evaluation of 13,000 using the CRISIL Quantix database shows that working capital comprises over half of their need for debt.

In this context, the push given to the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform — the institutional mechanism that facilitates financing of MSMEs’ receivables — is a positive, too. It was announced in the previous year’s Budget that non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) could register and participate on The latest Budget lays out an amendment in the Factoring Regulation Act to implement this.

This may not be enough to boost the participation of large companies and alike on TReDS, though. As of March 2019, the platform had only banks and five NBFC factors registered on it, and had seen only 2.5 lakh transactions worth a total of Rs 6,700 crore since its inception in 2014.

The extension of loan restructuring for another year (till March 2021) is also expected to provide relief to a sector that accounts for about 9 per cent of the banking system’s gross non-performing assets.

""We expect the industry to move the economy forward. The government is there to support the industry. We are putting money where assets have to be created. We have given the roadmap. The Budget is not sector-specific. The attempt is to take a prudent route to achieve the targets set,"" she added.

She further said that many people have been speculating that the fiscal deficit would cross 4 per cent. ""We may have a situation wherein you want the government to spend on pump-priming the economy,"" she said.

On being asked why was the Sensex not happy on the Budget day, Sitharaman said: ""But I see them being happy today. Monday is the true working mood, and today's mood is that they are happy. Aren't they? Not exuberant but happy somewhat.""

The fiscal deficit target for the next financial year beginning April 1 has been pegged at 3.5 per cent, down from 3.8 per cent in the current fiscal of 2019-20.

This is consistent with the government's abiding commitment to macroeconomic stability as part of medium-term fiscal policy cum strategy statement 2020-21, Finance Minister had said on Saturday.

394,['Press Trust Of India'],New tax structure will leave more cash in the hands of people: Revenue Secy,"The new lower rates offered in the Budget 2020-21 will leave more cash in the hands of those who do not wish to make compulsory investments to save tax, said Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey.

In an interview with PTI, he said the Budget gives an option to individuals to migrate to a new regime by foregoing their existing exemptions and deductions for a lower tax rate.

""We are not saying which one is beneficial, which one is not beneficial. We have provided an option. We have not put restrictions on anyone. This proposal can only benefit somebody and not harm anybody,"" he said. ""So, in this whole proposal, not a single person will be loser.""



He said taxpayers have an option to stay with the current regime of getting a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 and investing Rs 1.5 lakh in saving schemes and pay 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 30 per cent tax depending on income levels.

Alternatively, they can migrate to the new regime and pay lower tax rates without having to invest in any instrument to claim exemption, he said.

In the new regime, 5 per cent tax is levied on an annual income between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 per cent. The tax rate rises to 10 per cent, 15, per cent, 20 per cent and 25 per cent for every Rs 2.5 lakh addition. A 30 per cent tax is charged for income over Rs 15 lakh.

""Because the proposal is that we will continue the old scheme and if you find the new scheme attractive, you come or else you don't come. Therefore, there is no scope of confusion or worry,"" he said.

Pandey said the taxpayer will have to choose between old and the new regime at the time of filing return for the next financial year, sometime in July 2021.

""When you file I-T return, there will be a choice. If you say choice 1 then the return form in the new system will open and most of your application will be pre-filled. Then, you make appropriate changes and file I-T (return). If you choose the old system, then only that form will open. It is easier to pre-fill the form under new tax structures,"" he said.

He said data show that out of the 5.8 crore individuals who filed returns in the financial year 2018-19, 90 per cent claimed tax deductions of less than Rs 2 lakh, including deductions under Section 80C of the Act (for provident fund, PPF, life insurance premium), Section 80D (mediclaim insurance), Section 80CCD(1B) (additional deduction for National Pension Scheme), deduction for housing loan interest and standard deduction.

""I am not saying it (new scheme) will benefit everyone. It might benefit 30-40 per cent people. But, even if it is benefiting 30 per cent people then also it is a big thing,"" he said. ""We are giving option to those people who are unable to avail exemptions or deductions. Who are these people -- somebody who has just joined job market, someone who has not decided to buy a house, he does not know how much will be savings, he might be putting little money in PF (provident fund) and insurance. He may find that depending on his income, this new scheme is better.""



Similarly, for senior citizens living on a pension and who do not have to buy a house or put money in PF, the new regime would be beneficial, he said.

The new tax regime is also beneficial for small businessmen and shopkeepers who do not get the benefit of LTC or HRA.

""It is not that our objective was to provide benefit to each and every section of the taxpayer. We have provided option and that should be fine,"" he said adding the new tax rates would lead to a Rs 40,000 crore dent in government revenues in the next financial year.

Individuals having an annual salary income of over Rs 13 lakh and availing deductions of up to Rs 2 lakh will save on their tax outgo if they opt for the new tax regime proposed in the Budget, government sources said on Sunday.

For those earning a salary of Rs 12 lakh and less and availing deductions of up to Rs 2 lakh, the old tax system will be beneficial as the tax outgo will be less compared to the proposed new structure.

While individuals with an annual salary income of Rs 13 lakh and above will pay Rs 1.43 lakh tax under the proposed tax structure; in the old regime, they would have paid a tax of Rs 1.48 lakh, thereby saving Rs 5,200, a source said.

On a salary of Rs 14 lakh a year, savings would be Rs 10,400; and for those with an income of Rs 15 lakh and above, savings would be Rs 15,600, provided the deductions claimed are up to Rs 2 lakh.

In the case of non-salary earners, who do not get a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, the new tax structure is beneficial for those earning Rs 9.5 lakh annually and availing deductions up to Rs 1.5 lakh. They would save Rs 5,200 in their annual income tax outgoing.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/new-tax-structure-gives-option-to-save-tax-revenue-secy-120020301181_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

""Real estate sector is yet to reach anywhere near its past high despite all tax sops provided in previous year's Budget. This is partly because tax sops have failed to infuse confidence in the sector and also because many of the tax benefits provided remains on paper only,"" he said.

""To infuse confidence in the sector, it was also expected that some tax relief would be provided to those of delayed projects who are paying both EMI and rent. Unfortunately, no such concessions were announced in the which may further delay much needed recovery in the sector,"" he said.

""Notable developments in infrastructure, rural logistics, education and healthcare sectors will create opportunities in real estate space.

397,['Kanishka Gupta'],"Not all NRIs need to pay tax, here's what FM clarified post budget speech","The Union has introduced a new personal regime, in an attempt to bring down the tax burden for individual tax payers. However, the changes don’t seem to be in favour of Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who aren’t paying taxes to date.

Finance Minister in her recent Budget speech on February 1, proposed to tax Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who do not pay taxes in any foreign country.

Yes, this statement made NRIs anxious. Especially those working in the Gulf region where countries don't tax their income.

So, finance minister clarified that only Indian income of NRIs is proposed to be taxed under the new provision, and later Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) also put out a clarification saying that ""the new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries"".

Well, if you’re thinking, what made the ministry to come up with such a change? The ministry said it was an anti-abuse provision amid growing instances of NRIs shifting their stay in low or no-tax jurisdiction to avoid tax payment in India.

Here’s what Sitharaman said in a press briefing on Sunday, “An living in another country earns money there, which is not taxed there at all, but has some earnings through something in India and does not pay tax here either because he does not live here. What we are saying is this: for the income generated in India, pay a tax. If you have a property here that generates rental income, but because you live there, you carry this income there and pay tax neither there nor here.”

“Have I got even a sovereign right to take that into my consideration or not? I am not taxing what you earn in Dubai,” she added.

Well, in view of this the CBDT chairperson Pramod Chandra Mody said that the move is ""essentially an anti-abuse provision"". ""Some study showed that people are trying to stay in multiple countries for a period lesser than that would make them a resident,"" he said.

And upon asking if these people are doing so to avoid paying taxes, he said it ""appears"" that tax evasion could be the reason.

""Now, in such cases of Indian citizens who are resorting to this system we are putting a provision that if they are not resident of any tax jurisdiction then they will be treated to be a deemed resident of this country."" ""And by virtue of that, their taxable income or to say their entire global income, will be taxed here,"" Mody said.

This means an NRI, who is not a resident of any country, will now be deemed an Indian resident and their income will be taxed here.

Mody said India now has multilateral tax treaties with other countries where ""we continuously exchange information and hence getting information on such people will not be that difficult"".

What’s more, tightening the residency provisions, the Union has also reduce the period of stay in India from 182 days to...

398,,Budget stimulus unlikely to revive India's growth from slowdown: Experts,"India's new budget is unlikely to drag Asia's third- biggest economy out of its worst slowdown in more than a decade as the government has proposed only moderate spending increases and small cuts in personal taxes, economists said on Sunday.

They said there was a risk the government might miss its target for 2020-21 as it was dependent on raising almost $30 billion from the sale of stakes in state-run firms and financial institutions to meet ambitious revenue goals.

In its budget for the year starting in April unveiled on Saturday, the government relaxed its target so it could spend an nearly $15 billion more, mainly on infrastructure and farming, while pushing ahead with privatisations.

Economists and industry leaders said the budget proposals would provide some support to growth over the longer term but were insufficient to give it an immediate boost.

India's economy is forecast to grow 5% in the year ending in March, its weakest pace in 11 years, ratcheting up the pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is already facing backlash over a socially divisive citizenship law.

""We see the budget as largely neutral for growth and inflation,"" said Nomura economist Sonal Varma, adding that the financial sector's problems could further delay any recovery. The government has proposed increasing spending to boost consumer demand and investment but it could not go far enough because a slowdown in revenue receipts tied its hands, economists said.

Rating agency Moody's Investor Service said the budget highlighted the fiscal challenges from slower real and nominal growth, which may continue longer than the government expects.

Nomura said annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP)most likely slipped to 4.3% in the last three months of 2019, after dropping to 4.5% the previous quarter, its slowest in more than six years.

Economists said India risked missing its budget deficit target of 3.5% of GDP in 2020-21 as the government's revenue growth target of nearly 10% depends on raising almost 2.1 trillion rupees ($30 billion) from privatisations.

Investors and consumers were also disappointed by the budget as no new incentives were offered for the beleaguered financial sector and housing market while it wasn't clear whether proposed changes to individual taxes would result in net gains.

""The tax cuts won't translate into much benefit for taxpayers,"" said Amit Maheshwari, Partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, a tax consultancy, adding that they could discourage saving and help push market interest rates higher.

SHARES SLIDE

Indian shares slid to their lowest in more than three month in a special trading session on Saturday after the budget was released, dented by what analysts said was a lack of sufficient stimulus measures.

The NSE Nifty 50 index <.NSEI> closed 2.5% lower while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex <.BSESN> fell 2.4%.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Finance minister said investors would soon appreciate the steps taken to boost growth as she had tried to balance fiscal discipline with additional spending, while giving concessions to taxpayers.

The government expects growth to pick up to 6% to 6.5% in 2020-21, helping India move towards its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025 from nearly $2.9 trillion now.

Many taxpayers lamented on social media that the budget was largely ""corporate-friendly"" as it exempted companies from paying tax on dividends, on top of a September cut in corporate tax rates to 22% from over 30% for existing companies.

Receivers of dividends will now be taxed instead, increasing the burden on high-income taxpayers. Sitharaman said the government would issue clarifications on tax cuts soon and may infuse more funds into state-run banks, if needed.

Analysts also said the government's increased dependence on borrowing could crowd out private investments and put upward pressure on government bond yields, offsetting gains from recent monetary policy easing.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut its benchmark repo rate by 135 basis points since last year but debt-ridden banks have not fully passed on the benefits to borrowers.

The RBI's monetary policy committee will next meet on Feb. 6 and the majority of economists expect it to leave rates unchanged following after recent spike in retail inflation, while signalling scope for easing in the future.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-stimulus-unlikely-to-revive-india-s-growth-from-slowdown-experts-120020300087_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True
399,['Kaushik Mukerjee'],Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget proposals to stimulate economic growth,"Direct taxes

The Union Budget 2020-21 is woven around the themes of Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring Society, together with better governance and growth of the financial sector for betterment of ease of living. The tax proposals are aimed to “stimulate growth, simplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance and reduce litigation”.

Proposals to stimulate growth



Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT)

DDT will be abolished and dividend will henceforth be taxed in shareholders’ hands under the classical system. Indian companies will not pay tax on dividends from domestic companies to the extent of onward distribution of such dividends within a specified period. Mutual funds’ dividends will also be similarly taxed.

The biggest beneficiary of this will be the corporate sector (domestic and foreign) and lower-income non-corporates. Higher-income groups will pay more tax (Table 1). Foreign investors can avail of beneficial tax treaty rates and foreign tax credit (FTC) in their home countries. This measure, coupled with beneficial low corporate tax rates, should enhance capital inflows for industrial development. Reducing the dividend tax for upper tax slab individuals to the DDT level can be considered before enactment. A disparity still remains for domestic companies earning foreign dividends, which needs to be addressed.

Startups

The tax holiday for has been enlarged. with turnover of up to Rs 100 crore (earlier Rs 25 crore) will be eligible and can avail the three-year benefit within the first 10 years (earlier seven years). Startup employees/promoters will not pay tax on stock plan benefits until the earlier of five years from exercise, exit or disposal of shares.

These make the tax benefits more realistic for and should encourage entrepreneurship, especially in the field of technology, contributing to ease of living. Considering the low success rate of startups, a limited concessional capital gains tax can be introduced for exits.

Corporate tax rate

The beneficial tax rate (15 per cent++) introduced earlier in this fiscal year for new manufacturing companies wasn’t explicitly applicable to power generating companies. The benefit is now extended. Going by the nature of the industry, transmission companies can also be granted the benefit.

Co-operative societies: The other beneficial tax rate (22 per cent++) applicable to corporates will apply to co-operative societies also.

These extensions should benefit the Government’s thrust on infrastructure development and help rural development.

Affordable housing: The tax-holiday for developers will now be extended to projects approved upto March 31, 2021. Home-buyers will also get benefit of deduction (of up to Rs 150,000) for loans sanctioned up to March 31, 2021.

Although beneficial, the extension could be for a longer term, to help long-term planning. Considering the state of the real estate sector, removal of notional tax on unsold stock would be further welcomed.

Financial sector: Merged banks will now be allowed to carry forward the unabsorbed tax loss of merging banks. This will help create substantial tax savings for merged banks, which can be pumped into the economy.

Foreign currency borrowing: The sunset clause has been extended up to July 1, 2023 for the 5 per cent TDS rate on interest on foreign currency borrowings, masala bonds, and certain bonds to FIIs, QFIs, and so on.

Simplify tax structure

Personal income tax

An elective provision is introduced with beneficial tax rates for lower-income individuals/HUFs who opt for simpler tax compliance. Such persons cannot avail of deductions/exemptions but will pay tax at lower slab rates (Table 3). The option is to be exercised before filing the tax return, and is yearly for non-business cases while permanent (except for opt-out once) for business persons. Taxpayers can also continue under the older regime of higher tax and more deductions.

Elective tax provisions are now becoming a trend in India. This proposal would not only make tax compliance simpler but also leave additional funds with the taxpayer, which will largely be expended in consumption. This may discourage small investments but should help the economy through growth in demand. Being elective, taxpayers have the option to choose between savings and consumption.

Transfer pricing: The 30 per cent ceiling on interest deduction on loans from related parties will not apply for loans from the Indian branch of a foreign bank.

Taxpayer’s Charter: The Central Board of Direct Taxes will be empowered to declare a Taxpayer’s Charter which will govern the functioning of the tax administration. This is intended to deliver a better experience for taxpayers in their interactions with the tax department. Since this will be legally mandated, the tax administration can be held responsible for the Charter’s application.

Stateless persons: As per the Finance Bill, Indian citizens who are not liable to tax in India on global income and also not liable to tax in any other country due to domicile, residence, etc., will be deemed to be Indian tax residents and subject to tax in India. As per media reports, the government has issued a press release that this will apply only to income earned outside India but derived from an Indian business or profession. Similarly, NRIs visiting India for more than 120 days (earlier 182 days) in a year will be treated as resident.

This will prevent tax avoidance by people managing their affairs in such a way as to avoid tax residence in any country. However, genuine NRIs living/working overseas will not be affected. Such persons should also get treaty protection. The reduction of threshold for visiting NRIs may impact trade in a mobile world.

Catching up with technology in business: Foreign businesses without a physical presence in India will be deemed to have a taxable business presence in India if they have income from (a) advertisements targeting Indian customers, (b) sale of data collected from India using an Indian IP address, and (c) sale of goods/services using such data. Similarly, income of foreign businesses from the sale, distribution or exhibition of cinematographic films will be taxable as royalty.

While the domestic law in this case is amended, this provision may not be implementable until the tax treaties are renegotiated, except where covered under multilateral instruments (MLI).

TDS on e-commerce transactions: E-commerce platform operators will now deduct 1 per cent TDS from payments to Indian residents selling goods/providing services through the platforms.



In respect of both the above type of transactions, it was expected that a digital tax as in the UK and France, among other countries would be introduced. These proposals are probably a precursor to a digital tax.

To reduce taxpayer-administrator interface, electronic facilities will be introduced for penalty and appeal proceedings, and for registration of charitable/religious trusts.

Faceless assessments have just been introduced and the administration has not been tested yet. Expansion could be deferred for seamless introduction after rectifying the initial challenges in e-assessment.

Ease of compliance: Foreign companies having only dividend, royalty or FTS income will not file tax returns if tax is withheld at domestic law rates. Any treaty benefit would require filing. Considering India’s vast treaty network, this may have limited application.

Tax audit: SMEs having turnover of up to Rs 5 crore (earlier Rs 1 crore) will not require a tax audit, provided not more than 5 per cent of receipts/payment is in cash. This is a bait towards a less cash-intensive economy, but can be difficult to prove in practice for the taxpayer.

Fake invoice: Fraudulent claims of GST credit through false invoices will attract penalty under the income tax laws, equivalent to false invoice amounts.

This provision should be a deterrent but needs careful administration to avoid double jeopardy through other penal provisions for unexplained credit.

Pre-filled returns: Audit/ accountant’s reports will be filed one month ahead of the due date of return for enabling pre-filling of data in the tax return. Similarly, deduction of donations will be pre-filled in the tax returns based on an information return to be filed by donees. This would prevent false claim but donees need to key in data correctly.

Reduce litigation

Vivad se vishwas: A one-time scheme to resolve pending disputes has been announced. The framework will be open up to June 30, 2020. Applicants opting before March 31, 2020 will have to settle only tax demanded, and after March 31, 2020 will have to pay an additional amount. The scheme will be notified.

This scheme is a substantial improvement over that introduced in 2016 which waived only a part of the penalty and wasn’t so successful. The ‘Sabka vishwas’ scheme introduced for indirect taxes in 2019, with similar terms, was very successful. This scheme will also garner revenue for the government by the year-end.

Kaushik Mukerjee, Partner-Tax & Regulatory, PwC India

Non-corporate foreign assessees will also be eligible to approach the DRP, which will fast-track their litigation. Further, the DRP route will be open to any dispute irrespective of variation of income.

Pre-deposit before stay application to ITAT: The 20 per cent pre-deposit will henceforth be required. This may amount to curtailment of the powers of a quasi-judicial body and can face judicial scrutiny.

Transfer pricing: The scope of Safe Harbour and Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) will now cover attribution of profits to a Permanent Establishment (PE). This will provide certainty to business transactions for cross-border related parties. Given the expertise in APA administration, the results are expected to be much more scientific than arrived at through litigation. The scope of Advance Rulings can be similarly expanded to benefit other international transactions. Additionally, even unrelated parties can be allowed to approach APAs for similar profit attribution.

Conclusion

Overall, the proposals are intended to accelerate economic momentum and ease of living for taxpayers. The true experience of the simplest and smoothest direct taxes will lie in their administration.

On Saturday, the benchmark indices closed near their day’s lows, indicating further selling pressure on the following trading day. The Sensex ended 988 points, or 2.43 per cent, lower at 39,736 points, while the Nifty50 fell 300 points, or 2.51 per cent.

“The market was expecting the Budget to do more, given the domestic and global uncertainty. Over the next few days, the market is expected to absorb the volatility,” said Gaurav Dua, head of capital market strategy of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Foreign brokerages expect the risk-off stance to continue at least in the short term. “In the near term, the markets may gravitate back towards large-cap quality and defensive stocks. However, in the medium term, we expect equities to be largely driven by underlying mid-teens earnings growth,” said Goldman Sachs in a note.

The broking house has maintained the Nifty target of 13,000 by the end of 2020.

“Too early to say whether Budget Day volatility was a one-day event. We will have to see the market reaction this week as several institutional investors, especially foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), may not have participated as it was a Saturday,” said Krishna Sanghavi, chief investment officer (CIO) at Mahindra Mutual Fund.

Further, fund managers say a broader market recovery could get delayed as markets digest the implications of the Budget.

Flows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) can come back into the markets as the Budget relaxed taxation for overseas investors. For FPIs, dividend distribution tax would be calculated at the treaty agreements, and not attract domestic taxation rates. According to experts, this can have a material impact on the net equity returns of FPIs. On Saturday, FPIs sold Rs 1,200 crore worth of equities.

“We are generally positive on the Budget and we believe the market will gradually understand the positives from the Budget, after the knee-jerk reaction,” said Shankar Sharma, vice-chairman and joint managing director of First Global. Experts add that once the Budget-related noise abates, the market focus is likely to shift to earnings and global cues. “Future FPI inflows will depend on how economic and earnings growth play out,” said a fund manager.

For domestic investors, it was expected that the holding period for calculating LTCG tax on equity would be increased to two years. The stock market could find a stable footing on Monday as the China market is resuming trade and the Chinese government will be launching $173 billion worth of liquidity. Also, experts say the fallout of novel coronavirus will have an impact on emerging markets and India in the coming days.

401,['Somesh Jha'],"LIC listing may take about a year, says Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar","The listing of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) will likely take about one year and the government is not willing to sell more than 10 per cent stake in the insurance behemoth.

“We are already in touch with the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) to understand all the processes involved. The LIC Act will have to be amended. It’s not possible to do it in six months and may take around one year,” Rajiv Kumar said in a media interaction on Sunday.

Kumar said the idea behind the listing of LIC was to “bring in more transparency and allow the company to share gains with its stakeholders”. “It is very important as it will bring in the disclosure norms,” he said.

The sovereign guarantee for all policies issued by LIC will continue, the secretary added.

A top government official said the enterprise value of LIC was roughly Rs 36 trillion “according to the latest figures in the balance sheet”. The official said the government might not dilute “more than 10 per cent” in LIC. “It will certainly be less than 10 per cent,” the official added.

The government might seek exemption from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to offload less than 10 per cent in the initial public offer (IPO).

All companies are required to offer at least 10 per cent in the IPO.

Finance Minister had announced a stake sale in LIC through an initial public offer in the Union Budget of 2020-21.

The government aims to mop up Rs 90,000 crore from the listing of LIC and stake sale in IDBI Bank. The government currently owns 100 per cent in LIC.

On the stake sale of IDBI Bank, which is substantially owned and controlled by LIC, Kumar said the government was exploring various options, including a strategic stake sale. The government currently holds around 46 per cent in IDBI Bank.

“It is proposed to sell the balance holding of the government in IDBI Bank to private, retail and institutional investors through the stock exchange,” Sitharaman said during her Budget speech on Saturday.

IDBI Bank had become a private bank last year when LIC acquired a controlling stake in it.

402,['Indivjal Dhasmana'],"FM Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget goal: Lower rates, simple structure","Finance Minister on Sunday said the new tax regime proposed in her second Budget would ultimately lead to lower rates with simple structure.

Dismissing criticism that the new regime would not be largely beneficial to the assessees, she said, “eventually this should lead to a system where people are taxed at the lowest possible rate and are given a simple system. I am starting a scheme, which will eventually end there. For this, I’m not forcing people.” She was speaking to the media in an informal interaction a day after presenting the Union Budget in Parliament.

The FM disagreed with experts who termed the new tax regime complex and unavailing. She said the new scheme would benefit some taxpayers falling in certain brackets, if not all.

“…because the income tax cuts are deeper in the new scheme, we believe a taxpayer from a particular income bracket will be much better off coming into the new system. And in the new system, which however much I repeatedly say has no exemptions, there are some exemptions that we have allowed,” Sitharaman said.

Industry experts, however, argued that two tax regimes with optionality for personal tax, as in case of corporate taxes, only make the structure more complicated. Analysts sent out data to explain how the new tax regime would not be beneficial for those who take exemptions.

But the minister said, “I believe many of the calculations have probably not taken into account the exemptions which have been allowed in the scheme.”



Sources in the finance ministry said 53 million out of a total of 57 million taxpayers in 2018-19 had claimed exemptions of less than Rs 2 lakh. In other words, only 4 million or less than 10 per cent taxpayers took exemptions of more than Rs 2 lakh.

Analysts based their analyses on those claiming deductions in the range of Rs 4 lakh to 5 lakh, which is a small proportion of the taxpayer base.

Archit Gupta, founder of Cleartax, said, “With the optional new regime, taxpayers will have to evaluate what works better for them. Those committed to long-term savings and investing via 80C may be discouraged and this may likely demotivate them from investing in tax-saving asset classes.”



Among others, Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar- Shaw tweeted that removal of exemptions and dividend distribution tax would hurt the individual taxpayer, impacting consumer spending.

Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking said the widely expected personal income tax cuts had come in with lots of caveats, leaving no major impact.

To a query that removal of exemptions would hit insurance companies, Sitharaman said the government was giving more money to the people and it’s up to them to choose a product.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-s-budget-goal-lower-rates-simple-structure-120020300028_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,True

The COVID-19 outbreak, which originated in China last December, has claimed over 6,500 lives and infected more than 169,000 people over 135 countries and territories.

According to Issac John, business head digital (South Asia), Discovery, along with ""Coronavirus: The Silent Killer"", the newly launched app will come up with two more originals on the disease in a fortnight besides the new special on March 18.

John said the attempt with these specials was to look at ""events that define the world and humanity"".

""We believe there is a lot more to it than what meets the eye. This special is just our first attempt at showing the world in terms of what its origins were and what led to its spiralling out of control.

""However, the interesting thing about the way we are looking at coronavirus is that there needs to be information that comes from trusted sources, that's essentially what Discovery brings to the table. Our take is to begin with this and over the next two weeks we will be dropping at least two more Discovery commissioned originals on coronavirus,"" he told PTI in an interview.

Be it covering the Thai cave rescue in 2018 or the rising coronavirus spread, John said, the network has closely followed ""rapidly evolving"" events around the world.

""It's really hard for the entire story to be captured in one-moment-of-truth kind of a storytelling narrative... We will continue to weave the narrative with the trust and credibility that Discovery has always had in defining it,"" he added.

Asked if Wuhan, the Chinese city where the COVID-19 outbreak originated, feature in these specials, John declined to comment.

""Given that the topic is so sensitive, we don't want to say what's in it, what's not. What we are saying is that Discovery, like in the past, will have strong narrative pieces around most hotly searched, contested and concerning topics of this year,"" he said.

Megha Tata, managing director South Asia, Discovery, added that there were multiple ways of viewing the current situation around coronavirus.

""This upcoming special and the two others have a viewpoint. Every content piece has two sides of the story, especially in the infotainment space.

""When people start consuming it, they will know that this is one particular view to the issue,"" Tata said.

Discovery Plus, a direct-to-consumer streaming app, is now available for download on app stores.

The app will offer never-seen-before premium shows in 40+ genres including science, adventure, food, lifestyle.

Superstar Rajinikanth's TV debut 'Into The Wild With Bear Grylls' will be launched first on Discovery Plus, which is priced at Rs 299 yearly.

431,['Nikita Vashisht'],Will the RBI cut rates today? Fiscal boost also needed to battle slowdown,"Interest rate cuts have become the go-to tool whenever a country finds itself in the midst of a market-related instability or an The recent (Covid-19) outbreak, too, has led to a clamour for a rate-cut to support the sentiment.

Understandably so, the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), in a surprise move, cut its key interest rate to a target range of 0 per cent and 0.25 per cent on Sunday. The cut comes close on the heels of a rate cut done on March 3. Bank of England, last week, too, cut its in an emergency move to bolster the economy, as did central banks of Australia and New Zealand on Monday.

Despite this, the US stock futures were locked in their lower limit on Sunday (Monday for India), after entering into a bear phase (down 20 per cent from the top) last week.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to hold a media interaction later in the day today. It is widely expected that the central bank will cut rates and announce measures to boost sentiment.

So, is the monetary action not enough? Maybe, say analysts.

According to JP Morgan, interest rate cuts may not assuage investors who are dealing with twin shocks of a slump in prices and the outbreak of Covid-19, leading to a sharp repricing in global markets, including in equities, fixed income, commodities and currencies.

“More than interest rate cut, the most important role for central banks to play is to ensure that liquidity remains ample. While investors have gotten addicted to monetary policy responses during this cycle, the more important reaction is actually from fiscal policy,” the brokerage notes.

Apart from the first order impact of the virus, JP Morgan cautions the governments across the globe, about the need to prevent second-order effects, especially from “social distancing”, such as job losses and bankruptcies.

“This would include several microeconomic measures that can provide support to affected small and medium businesses and their workers. This would help to soften the short-term negative impacts of Covid-19 and would help to strengthen the eventual rebound. It is crucial for people to have jobs to return to and businesses to go back to when life goes back to normal,” it underlines.

Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research, too, calls for a mixed action-plan - a combination of rate cuts and fiscal boost.

“We need monetary action, right now, to ensure that businesses – whose cash flows or working capital have been hit due to lack of demand in the wake of the virus outbreak -- don’t suffer when the economy crawls back to normalcy, and they don’t default on their loans,” he explains.

unmoved - for now

Despite global central banks cutting interest rates, the RBI, so far, has adopted a cautious approach. While there were no rate cuts till Monday, the central bank undertook currency swap operation of $2 billion to safeguard the rupee’s value against the US dollar.

“Going ahead, we expect the to buy $18 billion of forex forward to contain bond yields to make room for open market operation (OMO) ” say analysts at BofAML.

“What India needs is a mix of monetary and fiscal boost… While a rate cut may still be given, government doesn’t have the space to provide fiscal stimulus,” Pant of India Ratings says, adding that the provided now would have to be prudently reversed when the is curtailed.

The fall in price, therefore, can be a blessing for India in this case. According to estimates by BofAML, the fall in prices could lead to a potential boost of Rs 500 billion or 0.4 per cent of GDP to consumption, after the Rs 3 excise duty hike, is passed on to the consumer.

has raised equity capital of Rs 10,000 crore pursuant to allotment of shares to State Bank of India (SBI) and other investors like ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Axis Bank under the Reconstruction Scheme. SBI shall hold up to 49 per cent stake with a minimum of 26 per cent over the next three years.

There will be a lock-in of three years of a part of the investments made by these banks in YES Bank. As much as 26 per cent of SBI’s equity investment and 75 per cent of the equity pumped in by other players will be retained in YES Bank for three years. Only those shareholders, who have less than 100 shares in the bank, can sell their entire shareholding.

Moreover, YES Bank also declared its corporate results for the quarter December 2019 (Q3FY20) during the weekend in which it reported net loss of Rs 18,560 crore for the quarter. Net interest income declined 60 per cent year-on-year at Rs 1,065 crore, which was significantly impacted by elevated slippages.

Asset quality deteriorated with corporate gross non-performing lending (GNPL) rising to 30 per cent and SMA & investment stress book (not recognized) at Rs 17,500 crore at 8 per cent of loans. The management hopes to contain slippages for FY21 less than 5 per cent.

The management said the Bank’s near term focus will be on deposit mobilization, retail loans including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), cost optimization and acceleration in resolution of stressed assets.

“We, however, believe that the probability of overshooting the target remains high and despite non-performing loans and advances (NPL) coverage ratio of 73 per cent, credit cost could stay elevated and weak operating metrics could keep losses continuing and even if the bank turns profitable it would remain sub-optimal for the next couple of years. Key for the bank would be to restore depositors' faith,” analysts at Antique Stock Broking said in result review.

Asset quality numbers look catastrophic. Higher provisions also resulted in violation of RBI capital adequacy norms. With slippages’ guidance of 5 per cent until FY21, any respite in credit cost, and thereby profitability, is unlikely in the near term, analysts at Elara Capital said in quarterly update.

Most analysts say that investors who have a long-term investment horizon should stay put. ""Normally, if an issue fails on listing, it takes, at least, 6 months to 1 year to stabilise.

436,['Vaibhav Sanghavi'],Market valuation is attractive; time to take risk for long-term gains,"2020 has been a year of unprecedented volatility, starting from the problems in West Asia led by Iran, following up with China Coronavirus, Union Budget, breaking of OPEC-controlled oil prices and the subsequent spread of virus from China to other countries, leading to a World Health Organisation (WHO) declared pandemic. The effect of all these events has led to a massive dent in sentiment and global have corrected sharply.

From a global perspective, there is an expectation that economic growth will take a big hit, as countries lock down to control the spread of the virus. Global equity are thus correcting anticipating prolonged crisis.

Various Governments, and their respective central banks, have come in with fiscal and monetary measures to ease the pain of demand shock in the short-term. While volatility has risen to 2008 levels, we have to be careful to compare the current situation to 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). In my view both the events are very different and not comparable. Once the fresh new infection cases plateau, like we witnessed In China, normalcy should resume. In addition to the virus, oil prices has also seen a sharp correction. Failure to arrive at production cut targets among OPEC has added to global risk-off.

What we've read or seen about the pandemic, it is expected to stabilise within few months as a concerted effort is put together to curb the spread. Meanwhile, while this is likely to have a short-term impact, this should not structurally change the dynamics of an economy, making this a temporary phenomenon. In the interim, the fear factor is likely to be at its peak. The effect of co-ordinated monetary and fiscal easing leading to demand incentivisation and liquidity will show its full effect on the economy and once this short-term fear abates.

The Indian government, too, has been proactive and have initiated various measures to control the spread of virus. That said, there have been some encouraging green shoots on economic data over the last few months - viz. better index of industrial production (IIP) and Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) numbers. Lower crude prices may lead to lower inflation, and looking at our high real interest rates, there is a scope of a sizeable rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Indian economy per se is in a sweet spot, wherein we are largely dependent on domestic consumption and have relatively lesser global influence.

From an equity market perspective, we have always been complaining of relative higher valuations. After current market correction, valuations have become attractive and provide a great entry point for a long-term investor. Hence, the current problem that looks to be temporary, isn't changing the longer-term structural economic growth opportunity. Strong businesses will bounce back equally sharply post the stabilisation of pandemic.

Investors should look through the shorter-term pain and as the longer-term investment opportunity looks very attractive. That said, the short-term volatility would continue to remain elevated and investors need to manage risk. It is generally said that return is a factor of risk you take, and maybe this is a time where we should take risks to benefit from the potential of earning better returns from equities in the long term.

Last year, the state had failed to achieve its target and could log only about 3.8 MT of compared to the seasonal target of 5.5 MT. The sluggish procurement in the 2019-20 rabi season was attributed to the Lok Sabha elections apart from the competitive prices in the open market, which had provided a viable option to the famers to sell their produce.

Following the poor response last year, the state government had extended the procurement window by an additional 10 days to June 25, 2019 to partly achieve its target and keep the wheat prices firm in the market for the benefit of farmers. (See table)

Of the total target of 5.5 MT, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) will directly procure 150,000 tonnes, while the remaining wheat would be purchased by the various state government agencies, which would set up 5,000 procurement centres across UP.

The bulk of 2.5 MT and 0.5 MT would be procured by the UP Cooperative Federation Limited (UPCFL) and UP Cooperative Union (UPCU) respectively.

Addressing the media after the cabinet meeting, UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the farmers would be paid their dues directly into their bank accounts within 72 hrs.

He said the procurement would kick off from April 1 and continue for the successive two and half months till June 15, 2020.

The procurement would not stop during this period even if the seasonal target is achieved during the meantime.

Data compiled by the Agricultural and Processed Foods Development Authority (Apeda) showed India’s declined by 8 per cent in value terms to $2.8 billion between April 2019 and January 2020 compared with $3.05 billion in the corresponding period last year. In quantity term, however, the decline was a mere 2.4 per cent to 1 million tonnes for the period between April 2019 and January 2020 as against 1.03 million tonnes reported in the comparable period last year.

Of this, Vietnam alone contributes 36 per cent, followed by Malaysia (10.7 per cent) and Turkey (10.4 per cent). Trade sources believe that consignments meant for exports to Hong Kong and Vietnam are forwarded to China for consumption there.

“There is no respite for India’s buffalo meat exporters in the visible future due to widening spread of coronavirus,” said Qureshi Shakir Hussain, Director, Al-Quresh Exports, a city-based manufacturer and merchant of buffalo meat.

Meanwhile, exporters fear buffalo stocks have been piling up in slaughterhouses. Weak demand from overseas has resulted into a sharp fall in realisation.

Hussain said buffalo meat demand would rise once this transition period gets over, and would revive overall sentiment possibly within three months.

Additionally, road cess was raised by Re 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10.

With this, the total incidence of on petrol has risen to Rs 22.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 18.83.

The tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.

Officials said the increase in excise duty will result in annual increase of government revenues by about Rs 39,000 crore. The gains during the remaining three weeks of the current fiscal would be less than Rs 2,000 crore.

Petrol and diesel prices, which are changed on a daily basis, were cut by 13 paise and 16 paise respectively as oil companies adjusted the excise duty hike against the drop in prices that warrants from international rates slumping the most since the Gulf war.

Petrol now cost Rs 69.87 a litre in Delhi and a litre of diesel comes for Rs 62.58.

The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.

This would help in generating the resources for development of infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure, they said.

Benchmark crude oil prices have halved since January to USD 32 per barrel. In sync with this, the prices of petrol and diesel have also come down by more than Rs 6 per litre (from Rs 76.01 a litre on January 11, 2020 to Rs 69.87 a litre on March 14 for petrol, and from Rs 69.17 to Rs 62.58 for diesel during the same period in Delhi).",https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-up-by-rs-3-per-litre-as-oil-prices-decline-120031400177_1.html,Business Standard,Markets,True

The Nifty plunged 10 per cent in opening session, leading to a trading halt for the first time in 12 years. During the hour-long trading break, US equity futures and the Asian saw a dramatic recovery underpinned by central bank measures, which helped repair investor sentiment bruised by stocks plunging to multi-year lows.

After dropping to 8,555, the Nifty managed to end the day at 9,955, up 365 points, or 3.81 per cent, over the previous day’s close — and 16.4 per cent over the day’s low. The Sensex, after slipping to 29,389, staged a 4,700-point come back to end at 34,103.

The sharply-lower opening in the domestic market, as well as in other Asian markets, came in the wake of a 10 per cent plunge — the worst since 1987— in the Dow Jones index of the US.

Throughout the day, stocks exhibited wild swings, with many gyrating in a 30 per cent band. A day earlier, the Nifty had ended at a 33-month low, pushing the domestic into “bear territory”.

To stem the rout, Asian central banks announced aggressive measures. The People’s Bank of China decided to inject $79 billion into the economy through a reduction in reserve ratios. The Bank of Japan offered to provide $20.8-billion liquidity, while the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Korea took steps to iron out currency fluctuations. Lawmakers in the US were also expected to unveil a legislative package to address the economic fallout.

The US Federal Reserve promised to start purchasing a range of treasuries -- a step that effectively marks a return to the 2008 crisis-era bond-buying programme known as quantitative easing.

The sharp recovery in the markets was on optimism around stimulus measures announced by various central banks, said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services.

""After another sharp fall, some had to sell desperately to honour margin commitments. Following the early morning rout, huge value emerged in several stocks,” said U R Bhat, director, Dalton Capital India.

Apart from the stimulus packages, analysts said “short-covering” contributed to the dramatic recovery. Market players said the markets were not yet out of the woods as COVID-19 (disease caused by coronavirus) cases across the globe continued to rise.

Also, the selling by overseas investors showed no signs of easing. On Friday, overseas investors sold shares worth over Rs 6,000 crore, extending their 14-day sell-off to Rs 43,000 crore. After the latest jump, the Sensex and the Nifty are down 17 per cent from their all-time highs, logged in January. Sanjay Mookim, India Equity Strategist, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted while the market valuations had slipped below historical levels, further slide could not be ruled out.

""Sentiment around COVID-19 is driving global equities. Several large economies still need to contain the virus. This may require more drastic lockdowns and economic checks. That could drive a market to undershoot,"" he said.

Mookim said despite the sharp correction, ""we have still not reached the 'Kid-in-Toy-Shop' moment"". ""Quality, steady-growth stocks are still far from being cheap,"" he noted. Analysts said it remained to be seen if emergency fiscal and monetary packages would be enough to avert a global recession.

An spokesperson did not want to comment on the issue, but currency dealers were almost certain that the Indian central bank had shed all its inhibition to operate overseas, beyond its comfort zone, to protect the If offshore intervention happened, it would likely be for the first time ever. But some keen currency observers said the might not be a complete stranger to these markets.

“The central bank may have been intervening in these markets in small measures in the past too, but Friday’s action was quite loud,” said a senior currency dealer, requesting anonymity.

“It looks like there was globally coordinated action. Everything went up together. Stocks rose, crude oil and metals rose, currencies strengthened, the really did a smart comeback, and offshore forward points collapsed. There are tell-tale signs that the may have intervened in offshore markets,” said the currency dealer.

Abhishek Goenka, managing director at IFA Global, said the RBI heavily sold dollars even when there was huge risk aversion. And so, “as the risk on sentiment came back, the rupee benefitted”.

According to Goenka, the fall in the crude oil prices has managed to protect the rupee, otherwise the currency could have reached 77 a The RBI, it seems, would want to protect the rupee’s lifetime closing lows of 74.48 a dollar it reached in October 2018.

The RBI doesn’t put out direct data on its domestic intervention, but the data on dollar purchase and sales comes with a two-month lag. However, currency dealers get to know any central bank intervention by seeing how the exchange rate swings on persistent dollar buying or selling by nationalised banks. These banks work as a go-between the RBI and the markets.

However, if the RBI has to intervene in offshore markets — located in Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and New York — it has to do it through local banks there. Or, it can take help from other central banks, which can intervene directly. For example, the Malaysian Central Bank and South Korean central bank are known to have capabilities to directly intervene in these markets.

1917; Ford v Ferrari; The Irishman; Jojo Rabbit; Joker; Little Women; Marriage Story; Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Parasite

As your Oscar-pool guru, I would be remiss in predicting any best-picture winner besides 1917. The Sam Mendes-directed war movie has taken top honours from both the Producers and Directors guilds as well the director and drama prizes at the Golden Globes, and that’s the sort of awards-season war chest no other contender can compete with. Though it debuted late last year, 1917 is cresting at just the right time: After six weeks of release, it’s made more than $120 million domestically, and it occupied the No. 2 slot at the box office last weekend.

But.

I still can’t shake the feeling that Parasite could pull off an upset, in much the same way Moonlight vaulted over La La Land just three years ago. Bong Joon Ho’s widely loved South Korean thriller would be the first foreign-language film to win best picture, and by picking it, voters could help rehabilitate the academy’s reputation for being too insular and white. The film’s cast members garnered a standing ovation at the Screen Actors Guild Awards even before they won the top prize of the night. Parasite has passion, no doubt.

Is that enough? I’m playing it safe with 1917, but stay tuned: It’ll be close.

Best Director

Sam Mendes, 1917; Martin Scorsese, The Irishman; Todd Phillips, Joker; Quentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite

Five of the last seven Oscar races have come down to a split in the top two categories, so is it possible that even if 1917 wins best picture, Bong could still be rewarded with the best-director Oscar? Yes, though I wouldn’t bet on it: When such a split occurs, the directing winner usually hails from the bigger, more technically audacious film, and that describes Mendes and his long-take war movie to a T.

Best Actor

Joaquin Phoenix, Joker; Antonio Banderas, Pain and Glory; Leonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Adam Driver, Marriage Story; Jonathan Pryce, The Two Popes

Oscar voters are drawn to the tangible act of transformation, and though many of the nominees in this category are playing against type — including DiCaprio as a washed-up actor and Banderas as a quiet artist wrestling with pain — there is no more ostentatious act of transformation than Phoenix’s wrenching, intensely physical performance as the Joker. Considered by many to be the best actor of his generation, Phoenix has never won an Oscar. That will change on Sunday.

Best Actress

Renee Zellweger, Judy; Cynthia Erivo, Harriet; Scarlett Johansson, Marriage Story; Saoirse Ronan, Little Women; Charlize Theron, Bombshell

Sixteen years after Zellweger was awarded her first Oscar, a supporting-actress trophy for Cold Mountain, she will again return to the winner’s circle for playing a down-and-out Judy Garland in the last year of her life. None of the other contenders ever amassed enough momentum to truly compete with Zellweger, who’s been sitting pretty as the favourite all season. She’ll now become the 21st woman to win more than one Oscar for acting.

Best Supporting Actor

Brad Pitt, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Tom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood; Anthony Hopkins, The Two Popes; Al Pacino, The Irishman; Joe Pesci, The Irishman

Though the 56-year-old Pitt already possesses an Oscar for producing the best-picture winner 12 Years a Slave, he has never won an Academy Award for acting, and his confident performance in Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood offers a full-throttle testimonial to his star power. After charming and unexpectedly funny acceptance speeches at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards, there’s no way Pitt goes home on Oscar night empty-handed. Don’t you want to know what he’ll say?

Best Supporting Actress

Laura Dern, Marriage Story; Kathy Bates, Richard Jewell; Scarlett Johansson, Jojo Rabbit; Florence Pugh, Little Women; Margot Robbie, Bombshell

Dern has a clear path to victory here: The only supporting-actress contender who had earned a comparable amount of buzz was the Hustlers star Jennifer Lopez, and she didn’t even make the list of five nominees. For voters who enjoyed Marriage Story, a vote for Dern ensures the movie won’t go home empty-handed, and the 52-year-old actress is an enormously well-liked figure enjoying the sort of career resurgence that Oscar is always eager to reward.

Original Screenplay

Parasite, Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Won; Knives Out, Rian Johnson; Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach; 1917, Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns; Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino

Tarantino has won the original-screenplay Oscar twice before, so he can’t be counted out here. Still, the path to best picture almost always goes through one of the screenplay categories, and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood has lost much of its momentum for the top award. The best-picture front-runner 1917 is probably too sparse a screenplay to win in this category, so I expect the win will go to twisty Parasite, the night’s other big contender for the top Oscar.

457,['Ben Sisario'],"Grammy nominations 2020: Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X dominate","Lizzo, a charismatic new pop and R&B star, has been nominated for eight prizes at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards, leading a class dominated by fresh faces like Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X.

Lizzo spent much of the last decade as a struggling rapper and singer, but broke through this year with hits like “Juice” and “Truth Hurts,” and a bold, body-positive persona. Little known to mainstream audiences a year ago, she is now up for every major award at the Grammys, including album of the year for the deluxe version of “Cuz I Love You,” record and song of the year for “Truth Hurts,” and best new artist, the Recording Academy announced on Wednesday.

Not so long ago, the Grammys were routinely criticised for rewarding journeyman stars and rock elders at the expense of pop’s younger and more vital ranks. No longer. Continuing a trend that has been building for several years, the latest crop of nominees are young, diverse and largely reflective of the forefront of pop.

Lizzo’s competition includes two artists with six nominations each: Eilish, a 17-year-old alternative auteur who has built a wildly devoted following, and Lil Nas X, a 20-year-old rapper and master of internet memes whose “country-trap” hybrid “Old Town Road” became an all-pervasive cultural phenomenon this year, breaking Billboard’s singles chart record with 19 weeks at No. 1.

Eilish’s “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” is up for album of the year; “Bad Guy” is up for record and song of the year; and Eilish is a contender for best new artist. She is the youngest person to be nominated for all four top categories. Finneas O’Connell, her brother and primary collaborator, received five nods for his work with her as a producer and songwriter.

Lil Nas X was nominated for record of the year for the remix of “Old Town Road” (which features the country star Billy Ray Cyrus) and album of the year for “7,” an eight-song EP. He is also up for best new artist, in what may be seen as a challenge to the academy’s more conservative voting ranks, who have often been reluctant to reward artists they view as untested.

Alternative auteur Billie Eilish

But Lil Nas X has also come to stand for many of the changes now sweeping pop music. “Old Town Road” first exploded as a hit on TikTok, the video app, and his blithe combination of rap and country highlighted the increasing blurring of genre. At first, Nashville struggled to accept him; last week, “Old Town Road” won best musical event at the Country Music Association Awards.

Even so, Lil Nas X was not nominated in any of the Grammys’ country categories. The nominees for country album of the year are Eric Church’s “Desperate Man,” Reba McEntire’s “Stronger Than the Truth,” Pistol Annies’ “Interstate Gospel,” Thomas Rhett’s “Center Point Road” and Tanya Tucker’s “While I’m Livin’.”

The awards ceremony will be held on Jan. 26 in Los Angeles, and broadcast by CBS.

Among this year’s other top nominees, Ariana Grande received five nods, including record of the year for “7 Rings” — a recasting of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “My Favorite Things” — and album of the year for “Thank U, Next.” The young R&B singer H.E.R., who took home two awards at the most recent Grammys, is also up for five, including album of the year for “I Used to Know Her” and record and song of the year for “Hard Place.” (Record of the year is for performers and producers, while the song category recognises songwriters.)

Winners will be chosen by the academy’s 11,000 voting members.

458,['Vanessa Friedman'],Gaultier's great goodbye,"Jean Paul Gaultier, the French designer who put Madonna in a bullet-bra and men in skirts, scandalised the couture establishment by hosting the TV show “Eurotrash” and never forgot his sense of humour, yet could cut a tuxedo with such panache he was regarded as an heir to Yves Saint Laurent, said goodbye to the runway after 50 years this week.

He did it in the gilded 19th-century Théâtre du Châtelet, where the Ballets Russes once danced, in front of a packed 2,500-seat audience that included the former supermodel and the former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and the designers Nicolas Ghesquière (who began his career as a junior assistant to Gaultier), Christian Lacroix and Dries Van Noten, who had made the trip in from Antwerp, Belgium, just for the evening.

And he did it with a greatest hits spectacular starring friends and family, from the actors Béatrice Dalle and Rossy De Palma to the models Yasmin Le Bon and Paris Jackson, plus the burlesque star Dita Von Teese. Plus Boy George, who opened the whole thing with his own version of Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black,” and closed it with “Church of the Poison Mind”.

Gaultier, 67, stepped back from the ready-to-wear runway in 2014, but this was his final farewell — at least to shows. It seems he will continue to have some role in his company, which is owned by the Spanish group Puig, and he’s already dabbling in a sideline as a cabaret director. He announced his departure from the catwalk only five days ago, via Instagram.

To a certain extent, simply surviving a half century is an achievement in a fashion world where these days designers seem to come and go almost annually. Gaultier navigated the move from family-run artisanal houses to global brands dominated by mega groups, and did his time as creative director of a big house, taking the reins at Hermès from 2003 to 2010. If he has been, latterly, more of a prankster than anything else, wallowing in his own thematic puns — 1980s pop stars! Nanook of the North! — sometimes to the detriment of the clothes themselves, he also helped the shape the industry as we know it.

His final collection was no different; balanced on the knife edge between showgirl and chic, listing toward the former. Gaultier overindulged himself with more than 200 looks, not just reminders of favourites past (corsetry and underwear-as-outerwear; denim sliced and embroidered and elevated; tuxedo trousers turned into hot pants in front, the legs streaming out like a train behind; the blue-and-white-striped marinière; a body suit with the naked body embroidered on top) but examples of his artistry; his ability to make you look — and then think again.

He didn’t just recycle his themes, he upcycled his fabrics, melding silk ties into striped skirts, leather bombers into a bubble mini, and false-fronting jackets onto the top of corsets.

Camouflage coats billowed like clouds; columns of crochet encrusted in elaborate embroidered runes; basket-woven leathers; a breast plate made from mother-of-pearl shells atop a skirt made of real sponges.

“I have opened all my drawers, taken back all my old collections,” he wrote in his farewell note. “I have used my archives as material. Goodbye, the brand-new; hello, the brand old. What I did at the beginning with no resources, I do today with my inheritance to give life to new creations.”

Overlying it all was such a reservoir of well-earned good will, it cast the entire collection in a rosy glow.

And it was a potent reminder, as the designer was carried off on the arms of his cast, dancing and hugging his way into his future, that fashion ought to be both challenging and fun, and is best accessorised with laughter.

459,['Veer Arjun Singh'],Adidas Ultraboost 20: A performance powerhouse for athletes,"dreamt of a gravity-defying shoe and shot off its beloved Ultraboost to the International Space Station. While it did get a futuristic paint-job that screams “I was in space”, the Ultraboost 20 seems to have learned the rest from Earth’s streets. It’s a refresher of last year’s Ultraboost 19 with subtle but crucial changes. Here’s how the pair felt on feet in Delhi’s punishing cold.

Design (4/5)

The Ultraboost 19 introduced a one-piece upper that wraps around the foot like a sock called PrimeKnit. In most colourways, it has a multi-colour hue with an additional layer of threading in the vamp area or around the midsole or both. The UB20 changes the upper to a uniformly coloured, single-tone PrimeKnit textile, reminiscent of the original Ultraboost. A single colour upper goes well with the alien-inspired purple-hued, multi-colored midsole. I’d recommend the black colourway (pictured) if you are a runner first and a sneakerhead after. The white and grey, much like the many colourways of the UB19, are beautiful sneakers but impractical for a performance shoe that mustn’t be boxed.

The translucent lace cage of the UB19 also gets a revamp with a reflective three-stripes logo. The tongue looks tidier in a single stitch. The heel, constructed with neoprene instead of PrimeKnit, is a change I appreciate the most. It does not rub against the feet like fibre sometimes does. And the single, reflective orange stripe at the back is playful, and also useful during night runs.

My only disappointment with the design is that the skeletal heel-frame has already started losing colour in two weeks of rugged use. That’s poor performance for an ace running shoe that doubles up as a dope sneaker.

Performance (5/5)

The UB19 packs the most responsive cushioning I have ever experienced in a pair of shoes. And its uniformly stretchy PrimeKnit is great for long-distance running. Along with the Asics Gel-Nimbus 21, it has been my go-to running pair for some time now. But a few kilometres shy of completing a hundred in the pair, I have been longing for a few improvements. And surprisingly, the UB20 fixes most of them.

The legendary Boost midsole is noticeably more concentrated and perhaps slightly trimmed. It feels a bit like the Boost HD midsole of the Pulseboost HD — a very versatile pair currently available on discount for Rs 8,339 — but more premium. It’s still very responsive but less cushioned, something most runners I exchange notes with had hoped for.

The stretchy upper and the wide toe box still make my broad feet happy, but what I absolutely love in the UB20 is that new PrimeKnit feels less stiff around the vamp while a tailored double-stitch reinforces the edges around the toe box. It eases the strain during sharp turns and protects the foot from abrasions.

Verdict (4.5/5)

The cushioned yet rugged Ultraboost, which can clock more miles than most pairs without showing signs of weakness, has been tweaked to perform even better. At 300 grams a piece, it’s not the lightest of running shoes, but the UB20 for Rs 18,999 will take you the distance and last you very nearly a lifetime. Just what the distance runners ordered.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/lifestyle/ultraboost-20-at-300-grams-each-these-running-shoes-are-not-the-lightest-120010400027_1.html,Business Standard,Lifestyle,True

Popular globally, Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. The free online support would be provided through Prutor.ai, a proprietary suite developed at IIT-K. Prutor, which offers many specialised online courses, has already been adopted by IIT Mumbai, IIT Goa, IIT Madras and other leading institutions to teach coding.

According to an IIT-K communiqué, most colleges had to cancel their physical classes to prevent the from spreading. In this regard, the Institute has made the online content and access to Prutor free to any university and college in the world, which cannot take physical classes anymore due to the pandemic.

In fact, the Institute has also called upon companies to contribute their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to further expand the reach of the free tutorial offer.

“Prutor.ai is a technology that is not available anywhere else, and IIT Kanpur would be happy to provide it to any university and college willing to adopt it. We want to teach coding to as many students as possible. If any company can share some CSR funds then we can help accelerate this,” Dr Amey, who developed Prutor, noted.

The interested educational institutions can sign up through an online portal (https://prutor.ai/) and will have free access through July 31, 2020 for any number of students. Until recently, this advanced tool and associated video lectures were available only to select IITs.

According to Amey, only the top Indian universities are equipped for such online learning modules, while the majority of others still lack the necessary infrastructure to run such specialised courses on their own.

He said Prutor was a proprietary technology developed at IIT Kanpur over the last six years utilising thousands of hours of teachers and students. “Any student above the 8th standard can learn programming using Prutor.”

Meanwhile, the Institute has offered to make available lectures in both Hindi and English to any college or university on request.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/education/coronavirus-outbreak-iit-kanpur-launches-globally-free-online-tutorials-120031500681_1.html,Business Standard,Education,True

Beginning Thursday, online learning giant said it is going to provide every impacted university in the world free access to its course catalogue through ‘ for Campus’ until July 31.

“We’re going to make ‘ for Campus’ offering freely available to any college or university in the world that is impacted by coronavirus, in the hope that they can rapidly allow students to start learning and ensure we have minimal impact from on the student community,” said Leah Belsky, chief enterprise officer and senior vice-president, Coursera.

Coursera, founded by Stanford Professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, has 48 million registered learners worldwide and offers courses, specialisations, degrees, and certificate programmes online.

The ‘Coursera for Campus’ offers job-relevant online to students, alumni, faculty, and employees of firms like Mindtree, Tata Communications, Axis Bank, Infosys, Airtel, and Manipal Group.

Indian universities can continue teaching their students online without creating new infrastructure. Coursera’s existing ‘Coursera for Campus’ partners include Manipal Academy of Higher Education, UPES, Shiv Nadar University, KL University, NMIMS, and Pearl Academy.

In India, it has 5 million registered learners, and is adding over 100,000 learners per month.



Universities can sign up to provide their enrolled students with access to more than 3,800 courses and 400 specialisations from Coursera’s top university and industry partners.

Similarly, Indian education technology firms are also offering free classes and course material for students impacted by the novel On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

Bengaluru-based edtech firm Simplilearn is providing free access to its courses, based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, Big Data, and cybersecurity, among others, to its users.

“We understand the possible restrictions (due to the outbreak) and thereby continue to support the growth of our learners through our free online programmes on our app,” said Krishna Kumar, founder and chief executive, Simplilearn.

Byju’s also said it would provide free access to its complete app to school students till the end of April.

Some Indian states like Kerala, Karnataka and New Delhi have already announced the closure of schools.

A report states that the education of over 290 million students across 13 countries will be interrupted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vedantu too is offering support to students, parents and schools in Bengaluru, New Delhi, Kerala and Hyderabad to provide free access to its complete learning platform. Vedantu will offer free access to all live classes of Vedantu master teachers, study material, tests and assignments.

""We are constantly working on solutions that will drive evolution, fundamentally changing the pattern of teaching and learning today. We are here to support by making our platform free during this crucial time,” said Vamsi Krishna, CEO and co-founder, Vedantu.

Another edtech platform Unacademy said it will conduct close to 20,000 free live classes on its platform, across exam categories like UPSC, banking, railways and so on.

Unacademy claims it has 10,000 educators, 13 million learners, and subscriptions for over 30 exam categories.

Educational Initiatives, a 20-year old edtech company based out of Bengaluru is also offering 60 days free access of Mindspark to all students, so that the school closure due to COVID-19 does not impact their learning.

Additional Solicitor General A N S Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that government had ""appointed CBI to hold inquiry in the matter"" and the exam was also conducted afresh for the paper which was allegedly leaked.

Nadkarni said the government would accept the recommendations made by the committee, headed by retired apex court judge Justice G S Singhvi.

The other members of the committee are: co-founder of tech giant Infosys Nandan Nilekani, renowned computer scientist Vijay Bhatkar, renowned mathematician R L Karandikar, Sanjay Bhardwaj and a representative each from the Centre as well as the CBI.

The apex court, however, had made clear that declaration of results of examination would be subject to final outcome of the case.

Popular globally, Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. The free online support would be provided through Prutor.ai, a proprietary suite developed at IIT-K. Prutor, which offers many specialised online courses, has already been adopted by IIT Mumbai, IIT Goa, IIT Madras and other leading institutions to teach coding.

According to an IIT-K communiqué, most colleges had to cancel their physical classes to prevent the from spreading. In this regard, the Institute has made the online content and access to Prutor free to any university and college in the world, which cannot take physical classes anymore due to the pandemic.

In fact, the Institute has also called upon companies to contribute their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to further expand the reach of the free tutorial offer.

“Prutor.ai is a technology that is not available anywhere else, and IIT Kanpur would be happy to provide it to any university and college willing to adopt it. We want to teach coding to as many students as possible. If any company can share some CSR funds then we can help accelerate this,” Dr Amey, who developed Prutor, noted.

The interested educational institutions can sign up through an online portal (https://prutor.ai/) and will have free access through July 31, 2020 for any number of students. Until recently, this advanced tool and associated video lectures were available only to select IITs.

According to Amey, only the top Indian universities are equipped for such online learning modules, while the majority of others still lack the necessary infrastructure to run such specialised courses on their own.

He said Prutor was a proprietary technology developed at IIT Kanpur over the last six years utilising thousands of hours of teachers and students. “Any student above the 8th standard can learn programming using Prutor.”

Meanwhile, the Institute has offered to make available lectures in both Hindi and English to any college or university on request.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/education/coronavirus-outbreak-iit-kanpur-launches-globally-free-online-tutorials-120031500681_1.html,Business Standard,Education,True

I could see myself selecting [Senator] Amy Klobuchar, [former Georgia State Rep.] Stacey Abrams, or any one of the tens of millions of women perfectly capable of pulling off this no-show gig. I don’t really care what her politics are, and anyway it hardly matters. This works out well, actually, since I can stick a lady in the VP spot and don’t have to put one in an important role on the cabinet.” At press time, Biden was being praised by members of the media and his own party for his commitment to symbolic representation in an office that most people forget about half the time.

But last night, while cross-referencing an old rule book in preparation for the upcoming debate, we came across this forgotten section of our charter, and, well, it all checks out. I admit it was a pretty cunning strategy on her part. With 100% of precincts now reporting, it appears the congresswoman received exactly 0.7% of votes in the Missouri primary yesterday. And so the time has come for us to put aside our differences and unite behind the next president of the United States, Tulsi Gabbard.” Perez went on to apologize on behalf of his entire party for not awarding the Democratic nomination for president to Sen.

So everyone should just relax and wait for them. They can send the fire department and the ambulance or both, and then they can probably give you a flu shot or something like that. It’s good. We’re in good shape.” At press time, White House sources confirmed the president had dialed 911 again to tell them that everything was actually fine and the nation didn’t need their help at all.

At the end of the day, whether you’re a Biden supporter or a Biden supporter, we have the same goal, which is to get Trump out of the White House and replace him with Joe Biden.” At press time, pundits launched into fevered speculations that the candidate’s speech could contain hints Joe Biden was mulling the choice to appoint Joe Biden as vice president.

The fact that I have already been able to serve as your VP and as a senator before that is a testament to what I can accomplish. No walls can contain my mind, and I promise that once I am released, we’re going to the DNC and then on to the White House.” At press time, Biden assured reporters that even if Nelson Mandela does not become his running mate, he does expect an endorsement from the anti-apartheid hero to be forthcoming.

I’ve dealt with the misfortune of seeing my hands reach out and pull a woman uncomfortably close to me and the embarrassment of them mocking me and saying ‘Stop doing that.’ I’ve worked to get it under control, and I want my supporters to be confident that I will only occasionally be touching women over the course of the presidential campaign.” At press time, Biden was attributing his support of the Iraq war and opposition to school busing as the result of a challenging brain stutter.

It’s the same thing every term. She just can’t help herself when there’s a 67-year-old piece of ass around.” At press time, Ginsburg had reportedly stopped Kearney as he was leaving for the day and asked if he wouldn’t mind staying late to help her with her briefs.

I was lucid for 70 years! I honestly can’t figure you people out. Why are you just now saying Joe Biden should be president when I can’t hold a train of thought for longer than 10 seconds or talk to anyone on the campaign trail without getting agitated and sticking my finger in their face?

They, along with the tiny minority of working-class citizens in disenfranchised minority communities who object to the moderate platform of Joe Biden, should not be made to feel invisible in our democracy.” Randall later added that it was also important to listen to older Jewish people, except for the ones who cast ballots for Mike Bloomberg.

In fact, if we harness that energy, I have no doubt we can deliver a resounding defeat to the entire Democratic party.” Biden ended his victory speech by claiming that if this momentum continued, the Democrats could be celebrating their biggest victory over their opponents ever at July’s convention.

This election is too important for Americans to take a risk on this fantasy of a small city mayor who could magically transform politics. The disingenuous, ego-driven promises, soaring rhetoric, and lack of results are why people have grown sick of Washington, and why I should drop out of the presidential race.” At press time, Buttigieg had declined to endorse another candidate, noting that suggesting Democrats had any chance of winning in November would just be another empty promise.

People love this Like A Virgin album, it’s a lot of fun to dance to, and she needs to build on its success. Taking time away from that to focus on what are sure to be small, insubstantial roles in lackluster films? That’s career suicide.” Reminded by reporters that Madonna had won acclaim for her role in Desperately Seeking Susan just a few months after his videotaped remarks, a visibly angry Sanders argued that Rosanna Arquette had carried that entire film and anyone who said otherwise didn’t know “a goddamn thing” about acting.

I mean, I worked with the guy for eight years, and he hasn’t even reached out to test the waters.

Furthermore, banning the use of the common folding chair as an implement for slamming birds across the head is a holdover from the days of ignorant environmentalists who don’t respect traditional hunting. True woodsmen know that respecting nature often means wrapping barbed wire around your fist to pummel a Canada goose or digging your thumbs into the eyes of a woodcock, and that there isn’t a hunter alive who wouldn’t curb stomp a wild turkey.” President Trump then posed for photographs while repeatedly smashing a quail beak-first into one of the White House’s marble columns.

529,,Experts Concerned Pale Russian Mystic Constantly At Trump’s Side May Attempt To Influence 2020 Election,"WASHINGTON—Increasingly troubled about the role the self-proclaimed visionary and healer might play in the presidential race, intelligence experts expressed concerns Friday that Volokov Molchalin, the pale Russian mystic constantly at President Donald Trump’s side, may attempt to influence the 2020 election. “While we’re unsure exactly what Volokov is whispering into Trump’s ear—or if it’s a known language at all— it’s the consensus of the intelligence community that he likely intends to meddle in the upcoming election, perhaps by using his self-professed hypnotic powers to sway the American public,” said National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire, noting that the long-bearded Eastern Orthodox prophet had enjoyed unprecedented access to the Oval Office since laying his hands on the president’s thigh in early June and allegedly curing him of an internal hemorrhage. “What’s more unsettling is that Volokov has only grown more brazen in his attempts to alter the president’s behavior, encouraging Trump to purify himself by self-flagellating, filling the West Wing with frankincense, or repeating occult incantations until his eyes roll back in a mystical trance. We’ve also received reports that Volokov can read minds, which would obviously make any counterintelligence efforts difficult, if not impossible.” At press time, terrified officials had escalated their warnings after a failed assassination attempt in which repeated stabbings, a gunshot wound to the head, and an apparent drowning in the freezing Potomac River failed to end the Russian mystic’s life.

Usually, I’ll just say something about how all my ideas are bad compared to his so I can get back to the laundry. I feel terrible for the landscaper who played Buttigieg last time.

We’re being outpaced in fundraising by the other campaigns, and that is great, because I am very, very tired and ready to admit defeat; so please, whether you have $1 or $100 to spare, don’t send either. I know I can count on you to support me as I head back into retirement and try to pretend none of this ever happened.” At press time, sources confirmed Biden began openly weeping when he received a $4 million surge in donations.

We read through the whole constant tuition [sic] and it says those guys can’t impeach you if they can’t find you. Here are two pieces of bread for dinners, and a straw you can use as a snorkel. Close your eyes real tight and you’ll be totally invisible. Okay, see you later. We’re gonna glue the bunker door shut.” At press time, the Trump boys were panicking after realizing they’d lost their father.

554,,Republican Senators Maintain They’ll Weigh All Evidence Before Carrying Trump Out On Shoulders,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that their duty to uphold the Constitution required impartiality in their role as jurors, Republican senators told reporters Friday that they would weigh all evidence before lifting President Donald Trump into the air and carrying him outside on their shoulders. “Look, as senators, we swore a solemn oath to deliver justice, and I intend to abide by that precisely as we use this trial to scrutinize the facts and then determine exactly how—and indeed, if—we will storm into the Oval Office, hoist the delighted president aloft, and regale him with spirited rounds of ‘Hip, hip, hurray,’” said Sen. Mitch McConnell, noting that his awesome responsibility as the chamber’s majority leader required him to tamp down on any partisan speculation on whether Senate Republicans would rush to raise the president up onto their shoulders while singing “He’s A Jolly Good Fellow” or if Senate Republicans would opt for a more stately procession in which they conveyed the recently acquitted Trump past each and every Democratic congressperson’s office. “Unlike some of my liberal colleagues, I understand my solemn role in this trial is to examine all the information at hand before passing judgment. Then, and only then, can we know whether it’s a reasonable course of action to deploy some form of red-white-and-blue confetti while repeatedly tossing President Trump into the air. Until then, it would simply be irresponsible to comment on whether or not we will incorporate party horns, noisemakers, or a big cake covered with lit sparklers into the proceedings.” At press time, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin had commended McConnell on his commitment to impartiality as they came to a swift conclusion on whether or not they should cue up Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration” on the Senate’s speaker system.

556,,CNN Reveals Bernie Sanders Running For President Of Country With History Of Sexism,"WASHINGTON—Calling their bombshell report incredibly damning, CNN revealed Thursday that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has been knowingly running a campaign to become president of a country with a long history of sexism. “This new evidence proves beyond a doubt that Bernie Sanders strongly wants to lead a nation that has repeatedly enabled, supported, and encouraged misogyny,” said Anderson Cooper in a breaking news segment, claiming to have several documents directly linking Sanders to a country that did not even allow women to vote until the 20th century. “Right here is a transcript of the text this woman-hating country was founded upon, a country which he willfully lives in and has publicly sworn an oath to, mind you. On just the first page it explicitly declares that all men are created equal, with absolutely no mention of women. And down here—look closely at these signatures that ratified this document as the supreme law of the land. You guessed it, all men.” At press time, CNN confirmed that Sanders had not yet denied his close ties to this country nor its tens of millions of residents with deeply ingrained biases against women.

557,,Stephen Miller Hurt At Being Passed Over For Job Stalking Female Ambassador,"WASHINGTON—After learning that Ukraine police had opened an investigation into whether associates of the president had surveilled the diplomat in Kyiv last year, White House senior advisor Stephen Miller was reportedly upset Thursday at being passed over for a job stalking female U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. “When I found out that some of Giuliani’s goons had been tailing the ambassador around Ukraine, my heart just sank—I mean, how could they decide to follow a lady around and not pick me to do the job?” said Miller, who added that after all the thankless tasks he had performed for the Trump administration over three-plus years in office, he figured he would be at the top of the list when a plum gig like stalking a woman on the administration’s behalf came along. “If I had known there was an opening for shadowing an important lady, I would’ve absolutely thrown my hat in the ring. Maybe I got passed over because I’m already stalking a bunch of women here in the U.S., but I still would’ve been able to manage my time and make it work. It really hurts that they didn’t even bother to ask. It would be one thing if I didn’t have any experience in tracking women without them knowing, but I’m really good at it. I can keep quiet in an alleyway, or stay awake idling in the car, or huddle in a closet without a peep for hours. And I’m really good at gathering hair and undergarments. I just wish they’d given me a chance.” At press time, Miller had decided to cheer himself up by lying below the former ambassador’s bed wearing her clothing while she was asleep.

Soleimani and ordered our military to rescind the Jan. 3 drone strike that destroyed his convoy at Baghdad International Airport,” said Trump, who explained the move would revoke Soleimani’s status as a Shiite martyr and decrease the likelihood of the United States being drawn into an unpopular war with Iran. “The U.S. Air Force operation that killed the general was conducted without the consent of Congress and, more significantly, without the backing of the American people. So today our forces in the region will take immediate action to return Soleimani to his family unexploded. This doesn’t mean we won’t take him out in a future operation if surveys indicate a majority of swing-state voters approve of such an action, but for now we will allow him to resume command of the Quds Force.” The president added that he has yet to see any polls that would convince him to retract his October decision to let Turkey kill hundreds of Kurdish civilians in Syria.

That’s all. Obviously, I can keep doing the simple stuff like biting my wife’s finger or challenging audience members to push-up contests seemingly out of nowhere. I know you think that’s helpful. I get that it would sink me in the polls if I were held accountable for past statements and actions, but frankly it’s just exhausting to be constantly acting this mentally confused when I know I can be so much stronger out there.” At press time, Biden was begging his advisors to at least never again make him punch himself midway through a debate to give the appearance of his eye filling up with blood.

Help! Can anyone hear me? I don’t understand where my donors are if they’re not in this cooler,” said Buttigieg, who had reportedly breezed through the diner, ignoring its clientele, before asking a line cook where the back room with all the wealthy campaign funders was located, getting frustrated at the man’s confusion, and deciding to find it himself by searching for a hidden passageway as the freezer door locked behind him. “I don’t understand—it’s usually right here. They have to hide in the back so we can meet in secret outside the prying eyes of the media and all the poor people. Where is the manager? Why on earth would I enter a rinky-dink joint just to hobnob with a bunch of people eating scrambled eggs and getting five bucks for my trouble when I know there’s a cushy hidden back room where I can talk to voters who matter over a glass of champagne? Jesus Christ, where’s [spokesperson] Lis [Smith] when I need her? I don’t know what I’m going to do. I already called for help in eight languages, and I’m starting to get really cold.” At press time, Buttigieg had resorted to doing his campaign’s “High Hopes” dance in an effort to stay warm.

Voters have an important choice to make, so we ask that you let any unpleasant feelings build up inside of you until you have the opportunity to get backstage and explode. Crying for an hour and then falling asleep in front of the confession cam is simply standard debate etiquette.” Blitzer added that the footage would be shared in a two-hour-long special following the debate.

Not to mention the hair dryer whirring all day and night as the lady president does her hair. And how does she expect to keep America safe when she’s constantly distracting our top generals by asking them for help opening difficult jars? Maybe we as a nation will be ready for a female president in 2024, if technology has improved so that vacuums are quieter, but until then we can’t afford to take the chance.” The Warren campaign reportedly responded with a fundraising email stating that the candidate was disappointed that Sanders had called her every single day since 2016 to say that women should never be allowed in public without a male escort but that she didn’t want to discuss the matter further and risk being divisive.

No. But you know what? Neither does Pete Buttigieg. When I listen to his uplifting, substance-free rhetoric, the only thing I can tell for sure is that he really, really wants to be president. And that’s good enough for me!” Fernsby went on to add that while he intended to support Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination, he still planned to vote for President Trump in the general election.

I’ve found peace here. I was working my ass off every day, and for what? To be president of the United States? To pass some immigration plan? That stuff doesn’t matter. I just want a quiet garden and people who love me.” Booker added that while girlfriend Rosario Dawson was thinking about moving in, she was more interested in a place with a little more hustle and bustle like Fort Dodge.

He’s always whispering that the fate awaiting me will be far, far worse than his, beyond anything I could possibly comprehend. Why do you think I barely sleep?” Members of the White House press pool were then seen running from the briefing room as the blood drained from the president’s face, his eyes rolled back in his head, and, using an inhumanly deep, guttural voice, he began to mutter strange incantations in Latin.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL), telling reporters that he had been forced to prevent numerous members, including John Lewis, Maxine Waters, and James Clyburn, from entering the congressional chamber since they had not been able to show two forms of government-issued identification, as well as a utility bill, to establish residency. “Yes, providing adequate ID is a little annoying, but without oversight, these so-called members of Congress could run amok, voting in multiple districts and leading to a fraudulent impeachment. We simply cannot allow this to happen, so if we come across any representatives who appear suspicious, it’s imperative we make sure they’re thoroughly scrutinized.” Gaetz added that in order to relieve exhausted congressional staffers, impeachment voting had closed several hours early.

Winners can spend the money on whatever they like, and have the choice between receiving a lump sum or annuity payments of a billion dollars over the next thousand years or so.

It might seem safe to just take a month off, but it could come roaring back in the middle of July when we are already 40 games under .500, not that that matters at all. We’re just thinking about the fans and their health, nothing else.” Cobb added that given the severity of the situation and the disruption of the coronavirus, the MLB might consider just starting the entire league over from scratch next year just to be fair.

Whether it’s revamping the marketing department or even the custodial staff, this is going to be a complete franchise overhaul. If people are not carrying their weight, then they are going to lose their job.” At press time, Timberwolves GM Scott Layden had been given a $25 million extension for all his hard work.

You get to switch positions and also move around a lot, which is probably a better workout. Plus, I bet some of the taller guys like [Jacob] deGrom and [Dellin] Betances could probably spike the ball over the net. I think we can be honest with ourselves by now that we’re never really going to get anywhere with this baseball thing, and it sucks to just keep losing to teams that are way better than us, so let’s just sign up for something where we can actually have fun.” At press time, the Mets clubhouse had devolved into a heated argument after Juan Lagares said that volleyball sounded even worse than baseball and suggested just going bowling instead.

I just assumed I was attacking one of our rivals when I lashed out after the game. Believe me, I’d never openly attack my own team like that—forget everything I said about us needing more ball movement on offense or rotating better on D.” At press time, Simmons retracted a trade demand after realizing he already plays for a title contender.

MIAMI—Crediting general manager Ryan Pace for playing an instrumental role in advancing his career, Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes thanked the Chicago Bears Sunday for selecting Mitchell Trubisky instead of him in the 2017 NFL Draft. “I would’ve never had this opportunity to compete for a championship if I had ended up on the Bears,” said Mahomes during a post-game interview, expressing his gratitude to the Chicago franchise for sparing him from years of mediocrity and career frustration. “There were some tense moments on draft day when it looked like I might be headed to Chicago, but luckily God had other plans for me. Instead of lifting this trophy, I could be languishing at the bottom of the NFC North and running for my life after every snap behind a terrible offensive line. I’m so glad I get to throw to Tyreek (Hill) and Sammy (Watkins) my whole career instead of whoever the hell is on the Bears.” Mahomes added that he only hopes all the current Bears players get as lucky as he did.",https://sports.theonion.com/victorious-patrick-mahomes-thanks-bears-for-drafting-mi-1841420779,theonion,Sports,False

Jim Jordan (R-OH) engaged in thoughtful and enlightened debate Thursday over the merits of proposed impeachment articles brought against the president of the United States. “Allow me first to congratulate you upon your exceptional oratory and remark upon what a great honor it is to deliberate this matter with a man of such high integrity,” said Jordan, who addressed House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) in measured and courtesy tones, commending civil discourse as the bedrock of a democratic society. “Although you have made some very cogent and incisive rhetorical points this morning, I must, unfortunately, submit a rejoinder in which I shall seek to elucidate what I believe to be a fallacy in your position. Despite our arrival at this occasion of discord, please know I consider you a true compatriot: a fellow truth-seeker with no interest beyond securing what is best for our great republic.” At press time, witnesses confirmed Jordan had nearly beaten Nadler to death with a cane after being set off by a remark impugning the honor of the president.

579,,Trump to Nominate Chris Christie to Supreme Food Court,"TRUMP TOWER – President-Elect Donald J. Trump has reportedly assured NJ Governor Chris Christie that, despite recent reports, he has not been banished from his inner circle, and will nominate the Bridgegate behemoth to the Supreme Food Court.

“Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little “Christie Kreme” (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him,” says Trump’s longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.

In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a “yes, I’ll have another” man that won’t clash with his own oversize, portly ego. “I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him,” said Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and he knows he’ll do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.”

Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.

Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. “Mr. Christie’s transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless,” he said. “I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.”

Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trump’s campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a “gargantuan-sized heart” and is “the perfect fit” for the new court.

“Governor Christie is not only ‘pro-life’, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know,” Miller said, “and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, I’ve seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, there’s nothing to worry about.” Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. “He will step up to the plate, that’s for damn sure.”

While often referred to as the “butterball” of the “Grand Old Party Sub,” it appears Mr. Christie’s nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion.",http://nationalreport.net/trump-to-nominate-chris-christie-to-supreme-food-court/,nationalreport,Politics,False
580,,Virginia Officials Embrace Blackface History Month,"<Richmond, VA>Government officials in the Commonwealth of Virginia have fully embraced Blackface History Month. While Virginia has long struggled with racism, momentum in support of the blackface community really picked up this week after a racist photograph surfaced on the yearbook page of Governor Ralph Northam. Northam has denied being in the photograph, but his denial fell flat after he confessed to having dressed in blackface for a Texas dance competition where he impersonated Michael Jackson by painting his face with shoe polish.

Fresh off the Northam news, Attorney General Mark Herring, second in line to assume the governorship of the Commonwealth, today admitted to dressing in blackface when he was a 19-year-old college student at the University of Virginia in 1980. Herring, who was among those calling on Northam to resign, said he was “deeply, deeply sorry for the paint that I cause with this revelation.”

Virginia’s Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, widely considered for the position of Governor in the event Northam resigns, has found himself in the midst of sexual assault allegations. No word on whether or not Democrats in the state will support his candidacy following the allegations.

This comes amid a spate of mall attacks throughout the U.S., leaving many area shoppers and victim advocacy groups wondering how such a tasteless joke could ever make its way into print.

A spokesperson for the Fox Valley Mall told local reporters they had no knowledge of the ad and said an investigation is underway to determine where it may have originated from. However, the mall will still honor the 10% discount as advertised.

“Oh that’s a load of horsesh*t,” said a Fox Valley Mall employee who asked to remain anonymous. “There’s no way that ad just magically appeared in the Sunday paper,” he said, “this is the new age of viral marketing. Better get used to it.” The employee said the sleazy ad fits the mall owners M.O. perfectly. “They knew it would create a stir and get people talking, and that is exactly what’s happened.”

Roger Holloway, founder of the victim’s rights advocacy group Triggerz, agrees. “It’s that mentality that says anything is fair game in the name of profits. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past some of these shop owners to stage some sort of false flag attack to get the registers ringing again.”

Mr. Holloway says big chain stores like Starbucks are banking on the annual ‘War on Christmas’ hysteria to widen their year end profit margins. “They know that holiday cup and all the make-believe controversy that comes along with it is the key to their quarter’s earnings,” he said, “thank God for idiots who get offended year after year after year over a coffee cup eh?”

582,,Flint Tap Water Rated More Trustworthy than Hillary Clinton,"A new survey released today from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC shows that residents across the state rated Flint tap water higher on the ‘Trustworthiness’ scale than democratic nominee for President, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

In the ‘Most Trustworthy’ category, Hillary scored a dismal 14% among active registered voters while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.





While the final tallies were a shock to many residents, MI Governor Rick Snyder isn’t surprised at all. “Well, what do you expect?” laughed Synder, “unlike the tap water in Flint, the folks here in Michigan can see right through that woman.”

Governor Snyder isn’t buying in to all the what he called “Hysterical hoopla” surrounding Flint’s water crisis, adding, “A lot of folks in Flint like to blame all of their problems on the water. We have a name for those types of people,” Snyder takes a pause for dramatic effect, “democrats.”

Oakland County resident Stanley Taylor agrees with the governor. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy.” Asked if he was surprised by the survey results, Stan replied, “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust Crooked Hillary.”

Past findings from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC were also critical of Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness. “Hillary’s lies affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span, increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment. Exposure to Hillary’s falsehoods can also cause anemia, hypertension, renal impairment, immunotoxicity and toxicity to reproductive organs.

583,,"Millions Mourn As Rocker/Activist Ted Nugent, Age 68, Found Alive","Millions of Americans are in mourning after news broke this afternoon that rocker/activist Ted Nugent was still alive. Word broke early, spread quickly, and sent shock waves throughout the rock and roll community and the Republican Party, where Nugent, 68, is well-known for his fierce advocacy for conservative causes, unwavering support for the rights of gun owners and hunters, and ferocious loyalty and devotion to today’s true American patriots. The National Rifle Association issued the following statement:

Ted Nugent has proudly and patriotically served on the NRA’s board of directors since 1995. The Association shares a deep sense of shock with our 4.5 million members and countless millions of supporters as details of this catastrophic event continue to unfold.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), one of several organizations Nugent violently criticized in the past, also issued a statement expressing condolences.

Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. Highlights from Nugent’s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine, in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the [Viet Nam War] draft: he did not bathe, brush his teeth, or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre-induction physical. To sweeten the pot, he also defecated in his pants. “I was so proud,” Nugent recalled. In later years he denied those accounts, saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter. That same year, Nugent’s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts.

President Obama, the target of many of Nugent’s negative comments, reportedly expressed astonishment when informed during a cabinet meeting that Nugent had lived another day. During the White House’s daily media briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz informed the assembled press corps that the President asked members of his cabinet to join him in a moment of silence to acknowledge Nugent’s survival.

Throughout Detroit and surrounding suburbs, fans both old and new erected makeshift tributes to the rocker, lighting candles, singing songs, and leaving cards and ticket stubs from many of Nugent’s concerts as testimonials to a life still lived.

584,,"Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say","<National Report>This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming.

Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.”

“Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,” WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. “Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.”





WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. “Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.”

The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally. Halliburton’s executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years. But based on the findings of WIT’s research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market.

“Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that,” the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning. “It’s obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less. Because these so-called `green technologies’ are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station. What good is clean air when our very sun is no longer functional?”",http://nationalreport.net/solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-experts-say/,nationalreport,Science,False

The turkeys, “Eric” and “Don Jr.”, will hopefully live out the rest of their days in obscurity after avoiding life sentences for their part in conspiring with a hostile foreign government to influence the 2016 Presidential election, obstructing justice and committing light treason (allegedly).

Mr. Trump will be announcing the pardons during a ceremony taking place in the White House Rose Garden. Melania and Barron will likely be in attendance.

This years pardons come on the heals of multiple pardons provided for equally jive-ass turkeys over the past two years by the Trump administration including disgraced former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio, serial perjurer Lewis “Scooter” Libby, and token foreign Conservative Dinesh D’ouza.

Other jive-ass turkeys likely being considered for pardons include Roger Stone Jr., General Michael Flynn, Jarod Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. The President is said to be discussing a preemptive pardon for himself as well.

587,['Barbara Jennnings'],Greenpeace activist gets arm bitten off after hugging a white shark,"An environmental activist was almost killed yesterday in the Indian Ocean after the great white shark he was trying to hug suddenly attacked him and bit his arm off.

21-year old Darrell Waterford, from Eugene in Oregon, was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace, some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth.

Along with four other members of the organization, Mr. Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator’s public image and raise awareness about shark hunting.

The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals.

Unfortunately for the young American, one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him.

It attacked Mr. Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow. The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital.

Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

“The shark seemed really friendly at first, but then it went totally berserk. It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant, so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us.”

According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water.

“Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when they’re calm, but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts. It’s not their fault, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible.”

Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive.

Despite the organization’s efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures.

Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark’s image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling.

Several members of the organization now fear that this incident will compromise their campaign to restore the white shark’s image as a peaceful marine creature.",https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/greenpeace-activist-gets-arm-bitten-off-after-hugging-a-white-shark/,worldnewsdailyreport,Politics,False

His mother, Sue Ellen Glasgow, 67, also believed the hype around toilet paper was meant to be a cure to the virus but did not indulge in the precious commodity.

“Everyone is talking about the coronavirus and buying toilet paper. I was sure the reason behind it was that it is some kind of cure,” Jeremy Glasgow told reporters.

“I would do anything for my son, and so I made him chicken toilet paper soup, mashed toilet paper and ham, I had to invent a lot of recipes as I couldn’t find any toilet paper recipes on the internet,” his mother Sue Ellen admitted.

The Savannah Morning News has reported it had seen data showing that a 180-year-old man from the North Pole may have had the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus on Christmas Eve, but did not make the data public. The newspaper also said that it was possible there were cases reported before the December date set out in the data, adding that officials had identified 266 cases of COVID-19 last year; predominantly amongst elves.

This reporter contacted the World Health Organization (WHO) asking if it has any comment on the data reportedly seen by the Savannah Morning News. This article will be updated with any response.

The first patient to show symptoms of what would later be identified as the new coronavirus, known as COVID-19, presented themselves on December 23, according to officials. The World Health Organization classified the spread of the virus as a pandemic on Wednesday.

The former world superpower, called the United States of America, appears to have been kidnapped and held hostage by the incompetent Trump presidency. His voiceless coconspirators are frightened Republican elected members of the House and Senate. They seem oblivious to the wrecking-ball Trump has taken to the taxpayers of the United States. Forgotten point: Taxpayers pay their salary, not Trump.

Mitch McConnell just gave the Senate the weekend off. Why? The US is in a declared pandemic. Store shelves are empty. People are secluded at home. If the Senate can take a weekend off during a national pandemic, maybe the Senate isn't a necessary part of the government?

Who knows what’s going on in North Korea? Does Russia have any coronavirus cases? Is Trump phoning Ukraine about coronavirus? There are cases in Turkey. Saudi Arabia also has cases.

Italy is in lockdown. Italians are singing from their windows to express their freedom. Spain has imposed a nationwide lockdown. Trump says no one can fly to England or Ireland.

When South Korea, (not to, in any way, hint at casting aspersions about the nation) can manage to test 10,000 per day, but Oregon State is given only 40 test kits, and tests 10 people per day, and Heidi Klum can’t get tested, what does the United States not know that South Korea knows?

Is the failure of the Trump administration in handling the coronavirus spread all due to dismantling the White House Pandemic Response team? And did Trump dismantle it just because the team was formed by President Barack Obama?

Trump also did away with Obama’s Clean Water Rule. Will citizens soon have to worry about catching a case of typhoid, cholera, malaria, or polio?

It may be time for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to begin impeachment hearings again. This time, however, Trump’s failure and incompetence is killing citizens. Hopefully, not Heidi Klum.

Or rather, his ghost has.

Executives at the PL met in London on Friday, to discuss the spread of the Coronavirus, and its implications for players, staff and fans, and decided that a 3-week break until early April would be a good idea.

In reality, however, 21 days is nothing to a deadly virus.

It can wait.

The real implication, is that the season may end up being declared null and void, as if it had never happened, which would mean there would be no promotions or relegations, and Liverpool would not be crowned Premier League winners, as it is still mathematically possible that they could be caught.

Mr. Shankly, who died aged 68 in 1981, was the man who came up with the much-used quote that:

""Some people believe football is a matter of life and death. I'm very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you, it is much, much more important than that.""

With this in mind, Shankly - in spirit form - was down at the PL offices making his presence felt, in a bid to persuade officials to end the lay-off at the earliest opportunity, so that the Reds can win their first title in 30 years, as is right and proper.

Futurism explains, “The invisible ‘tattoo’ accompanying the vaccine is a pattern made up of minuscule quantum dots — tiny semiconducting crystals that reflect light — that glows under infrared light. The pattern — and vaccine — gets delivered into the skin using hi-tech dissolvable microneedles made of a mixture of polymers and sugar.”

The journal Science Translational Medicine explains the technology as “a covert way to embed the record of a vaccination directly in a patient’s skin rather than documenting it electronically or on paper.”

In the face of COVID-19 panic and Democrat politicians pushing mandatory vaccinations, this technology could be used to track Americans who opt-out of a forced inoculation.

For example, even before the coronavirus outbreak MIT researcher Kevin McHugh, who worked on the project, said, “In areas where paper vaccination cards are often lost or do not exist at all, and electronic databases are unheard of, this technology could enable the rapid and anonymous detection of patient vaccination history to ensure that every child is vaccinated.”

As for Gates’ involvement in the program, he wasn’t just funding it, as Scientific American reports, but “the project came about following a direct request from Microsoft founder Bill Gates himself.”

Gates announced Friday he’d be stepping down from the board of Microsoft to focus more on philanthropic work during this worldwide pandemic.

596,,War On China?,"People are understandably upset about the coronavirus epidemic, but if we’re not careful, an even greater danger lies ahead.

Sinister forces in American political life are using the crisis to incite war with China and to stir up bad feelings towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people are in fact heroic. They are our friends, not our enemies. But the forces of evil want you to think otherwise.

Concerning the coronavirus, the key fact to remember is that we know very little about it. The worst mistake we could make is to become jittery and panicked. As Bill Sardi, an outstanding expert on health issues, has pointed out,

There are two hotspots in the world for coronavirus infections: Wuhan, China (Hubei Province) and Italy. Both of these geographic areas were grappling with tuberculosis outbreaks prior to the eruption of the mutated COVID-19 coronavirus. Strangely, coronavirus appears to spread to the rest of the world from these hotspots via airplane travel. But the infection remains in those infected and may spread within a household, but not into the community. Other geographical outbreaks must be questioned as there are too many false positive tests to confirm COVID-19 coronavirus, which at this point in time may be nothing more than a passenger virus that accompanies tubercular infections.

If Sardi is right, the main thing we can do to keep safe is to close our borders to immigrants.

Unfortunately, people are using the epidemic to stir up bad feelings toward the Chinese people, because the epidemic began in Hubei Province there. Ironically, there is evidence that the virus was really sent to China from the US. Larry Romanoff, whose “Global Research” column often uncovers items that others miss, says:

Not only did the virus not originate at the seafood market, it did not originate in Wuhan at all, and it has now been proven that it did not originate in China but was brought to China from another country. Part of the proof of this assertion is that the genome varieties of the virus in Iran and Italy have been sequenced and declared to have no part of the variety that infected China and must, by definition, have originated elsewhere.

It would seem the only possibility for origination is the US because only that country has the “tree trunk” of all the varieties. And it may therefore be true that the original source of the COVID-19 virus was the US military bio-warfare lab at Fort Detrick. This would not be a surprise, given that the CDC completely shut down Fort Detrick, but also because, as I related in an earlier article, between 2005 and 2012 the US had experienced 1,059 events where pathogens had been either stolen or escaped from American bio-labs during the prior ten years—an average of one every three days.

But even if Romanoff is wrong, the epidemic was not the fault of the Chinese people. Rather, the responsibility lies with the Chinese government, which suppressed warnings by local doctors. Had these warnings been heeded, the disease could have been contained with little trouble.

Hate directed against the Chinese blocks efforts in the US to deal with the coronavirus problem. Chinese scientists have developed an efficient way to test for the virus that can process forty people in 130 minutes, instead of the 2–3-day wait for results from US tests. The US government has made no effort to get this test but instead keeps it out of the news. Instead, we hear ridiculous talk about supporting US pharmaceuticals instead of Chinese pharmaceuticals. We should be supporting free trade, so that we can get cheap drugs to US consumers. We should not help Big Pharma exploit American consumers.

Because the epidemic started in China and spread from there, hostility toward Chinese people living in the US has gone up. Chinese-owned stores have been threatened, and gun sales to Chinese who fear attacks have soared. Chinese restaurants are nearly empty.

The president’s talk about the “Chinese virus” fans the flame of ill feelings, and some fear that the government may provoke a war with China in order to distract attention from a tanking US economy. US government propaganda has spread false claims about predatory Chinese trade practices to get the American people ready for hostile action toward China. As David Stockman has observed,

Indeed, the entire intellectual property theft meme is just a scam under which the business lobbies have enlisted the FBI and other law enforcement branches to function as taxpayer-financed patent attorneys and litigants.

But that’s not the state’s job at all: Enforcement of intellectual property rights is a cost of doing business that should be borne by patent owners; and not, again, by the proverbial bus driver shopping at Walmart’s and finding the cost of his tariffed necessities rising because some company in China is allegedly stealing trade secrets. Of course, the ultimate case of Trade Nannyism is the perennial whining by the K-Street lobbies that nefarious trade abusers like China “subsidize” their exports.

Why, yes, they surely do….send foreign aid to American consumers, that is!

To the contrary, if you want to level the playing field for American producers and manufacturers, instruct the Fed to stop targeting 2% inflation, and, in fact, to get out of the way entirely so that the domestic economy can deflate its high prices, wages and costs and thereby become more competitive on the global markets.

Provoking war with China is an incredibly dangerous policy. Eric S. Margolis, an experienced foreign policy expert, has noted: “But in a US-China war, the Chinese would be fighting almost at home. The US would have to sustain a major conflict many thousands of miles from its home ports. America is the world’s genius when it comes to logistics and mass operations, but even so great distances are punishing. It would prove a bridge too far.” The US would be the aggressor in a war with China. The South China Sea belongs to them, not to us, yet we send our ships there and insist we have a right to control what happens there. Also, a great deal of China’s industry and agriculture is privately owned, so an attack on China would be an attack on private property. Both the neocons and the nationalist “Right” want war with China. We should aim at peace instead, as Murray Rothbard and Ron Paul have taught us.

If we ignore propaganda and look at the facts, we should recognize that the Chinese people are heroes. It’s a scandal, in fact, that few Westerners are even aware, or, if they are aware, that they are not conscious, of the bloody reality that prevailed in China between the years 1949 and 1976, the years of rule by Mao Zedong

How many died as a result of persecutions and the communist policies of Mao? Perhaps you care to guess? Many people over the years have attempted to guess. But they have always underestimated. As more data rolled in during the 1980s and 1990s, and as specialists have devoted themselves to investigations and estimates, the figures have become ever more reliable. And yet they remain imprecise. What kind of error term are we talking about? It could be as low as 40 million. It could be as high as 100 million—or more. In the Great Leap Forward from 1959 to 1961 alone, figures range between 20 million and 75 million. In the period before, 20 million. In the period after, tens of millions more.

As scholars in the area of mass death point out, most of us can’t imagine one hundred dead or one thousand. Above that, we are just talking about statistics: they have no conceptual meaning for us. And there is only so much ghastly information that our brains can absorb, only so much blood we can imagine. And yet there is more to why China’s communist experiment remains a hidden fact: it makes a decisive case against government power, one even more compelling than the cases of Russia or Germany in the twentieth century. Finally, in 1976, Mao died. Within a few months, his closest advisers were all imprisoned. And the reform began slowly at first and then gained breakneck speed. Civil liberties were restored (comparatively) and the rehabilitations began. Torturers were prosecuted. Economic controls were gradually relaxed. The economy, by virtue of human and private economic initiative, was transformed.

Having read the above, you are now in a tiny elite of people who know anything about the greatest death camp in the history of the world that China became between 1949 and 1976, an experiment in total control unlike anything other in history. Many more people today know more about China’s exploding cell phone batteries than the hundred million dead and the untold amount of suffering that occurred under communism.

When you hear complaints about the “Chinese virus” today, imagine millions in famine, with parents swapping children to eat in order to stay alive. Let’s have peace with China, not war, and let’s admire the hardworking, productive, and wonderful Chinese people.

597,,Feds: 10.4K Foreigners Caught at Northern Border Before Canada’s Coronavirus Travel Ban,"Thousands of foreign nationals have been caught attempting to cross into the United States from Canada before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would close the nation’s borders to foreign travelers.

On Monday, Trudeau said he would be shutting down Canada’s borders to non-citizens with exemptions for permanent Canadian residents, diplomats, aircrews, and American citizens. Before the announcement, Trudeau had not issued a single travel ban — not even for China, Iran, South Korea, or Italy.

Federal data obtained by Breitbart News shows that nearly 10,400 foreign nationals were deemed inadmissible or apprehended at the U.S.-Canada border in January and February. In January, alone, northern border agents encountered nearly 3,600 foreign nationals.

In February, northern border agents apprehended 259 foreign nationals and declared 6,540 inadmissible. These inadmissible numbers and apprehensions do not include the foreign nationals who have arrived at northern border ports of entry and have successfully entered the U.S.

598,['Daniel Taylor'],‘Social Distancing’ From Pandemic Allowing Unprecedented Big Tech Power Grab,"Cashless payment, virtual reality, internet censorship, telepresence, robotics, artificial intelligence; these technologies have received massive funding and development from Big Tech in the last decade.

As lockdowns progress, social isolation becomes the “new norm,” and face-to-face human interaction is restricted, the emergence of a pandemic virus will give Big Tech the chance to shine darkly on all of us.

There was already a trend toward social isolation enabled by advancing technology and social media before the virus emerged.

Big Tech is more than willing to give the world another nudge into a digital Plato’s cave.

Trump recently announced that Google is already acting as an extension of the U.S. government’s response to Coronavirus.

Big Tech is also “fighting misinformation” about the Coronavirus by censoring online content.

All major Big Tech companies issued a joint statement Monday that said:

After Facebook’s failed attempt to launch it’s digital currency Libra, Big Tech has another opportunity to push a new cashless system as calls to ban cash intensify.

A recent article from Forbes said that virtual reality offers a solution to travel bans:

“Virtual reality (VR) offers a solution to the travel bans companies all over the world are facing and the restrictions on large gatherings that are being imposed by governments.”

The fight for a pro-human future is now more important than ever. At the very least, the seeds of a pro human world need to be sown now so that when new systems emerge after a potential collapse, humanity has a chance.

599,['Frank Furedi'],Language police want to rewrite ‘sexist’ dictionaries,"The language war is in full swing.

An open letter signed by leaders of Women’s Aid and the Women’s Equality Party demands that Oxford Dictionaries change their “sexist” definition of the word ‘woman.’

The authors of the letter published this week complain that the dictionary refers to a woman as a “bitch” or a “maid”, while a man is described as “a person with the qualities associated with males, such as bravery, spirit, or toughness.”

Like all serious dictionaries, Oxford draws attention to the different terms that are used in relation to a word. The campaign — which started last year with a petition by Maria Beatrice Giovanardi — wants the dictionary to drop terms such as “bitch”, “wench”, “bird” or “frail” in its historical definition of a woman.

The aim of this campaign is not simply to get Oxford University Press to erase references to words it does not like. Its main objective is to alter the way that people think about men, women, gender and identity.

The authors of the petition clearly resent the fact that the term ‘man’ still conveys positive attributes. It complains that Oxford’s definition of a ‘man’ is much more exhaustive than that of a ‘woman’ — with 25 examples for men, compared to only 5 for women. Implicit in this criticism is the aspiration to define man downwards.

Although the focus of the campaign is on challenging sexist language, it is actually about promoting a fundamental revision of the way people speak, behave and think about gender and sex.

This objective becomes clear in its demand to “enlarge the dictionary’s entry for ‘woman’,” as the petition puts it. To illustrate what the enlargement of the entry for “woman” means, it demands the inclusion of “examples representative of minorities, for example, a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, etc”. In other words it seeks to alter the meaning of woman by including men who identify as female in the definition.

Dictionaries have become an important site for the waging of the language wars. Campaigners are constantly placing pressure on dictionaries to include words that they like and censor those that they don’t.

A few years ago, a campaign sought to get the OED to remove its reference to “Essex Girls” on the ground that it was a lazy sexist stereotype. In this instance the OED stood its ground.

Trans activists have been more successful. In September 2019, Merriam-Webster dictionary announced that it will update the meaning of the pronoun “they” to “refer to a single person whose gender identity is non-binary”.

Not to be outdone, Collins Dictionary reported that it was adding the word “non-binary” to the dictionary. A few months later, Merriam-Webster declared that the non-binary pronoun “they” was their word of the year.

In their study, Forbidden words: taboo and censoring language, the authors Keith Allen and Kate Burridge stated that unlike normal censoring activities, which are aimed at the maintenance of the status quo, the current form of linguistic policing seeks to promote political and social change. Such campaigns are oriented towards the objective of altering how people behave and in particular how they identify themselves. For that reason their strategy of verbal purification is particularly directed towards influencing the socialisation of young people.

As the authors of the petition note, “we can take a serious step towards reducing the harm this is causing our young women and girls by looking at our language — and this starts with the dictionary”.

Unfortunately it does not end with the dictionary. In recent months, there has been a veritable explosion in the activities of the language police. To take one example, at Leicester University students who expected to celebrate International Women’s Day have discovered that instead the event has been rebranded as International Womxn Day. The university justified the the move by stating ‘‘We use the term ‘womxn’ as a more inclusive spelling of ‘women’ that includes any person who identifies as a womxn”. That’s another way of saying that the age-long the meaning of a woman has become the casualty of the Leicester University language police. How long before campaigners insist that womxn becomes Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year?

In his important essay, ‘Politics and the English Language’, George Orwell foresaw the corrosive impact of verbal purification on human life. He warned that:

“If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better.”

At present, far too many people who do know better have opted for an easy life, and have acquiesced to the corruption of language. They need to realize that if we allow them to decide what words we can and cannot use, they will end up controlling our most intimate thoughts.

600,['Daniel Taylor'],Deadly Pandemic Sets Stage for Globalist Takeover,"Due to the conflicting reports about the Coronavirus, it is difficult to discern the truth.

Mainstream media, and the establishment that props it up, has become so distrusted that a crisis of confidence is threatening to bring everything down.

Coronavirus is hitting the United States at a time of internal conflict and civil war at the highest levels of government.

What we can discern are a variety of mega-trends that at the very least point to a strong motive for a deliberate release of a man-made virus that could meet the goals of bad actors working against America and humanity at large.

At the very least – even if it turns out that mortality rates are low – Coronavirus is being used as a deadly economic and political weapon.

To begin, let’s take a look at some of the major trends and data points that have recently shaped the globe:

In 2017, the Pentagon initiated a study that assessed the threat of synthetic biology tech creating engineered biological weapons that are difficult to identify. As Wired magazine reported, this development “…could have implications for defensive strategies against a new type of bioweapon, potentially more difficult to identify because it resembles its “natural” counterpar t.”

t.” The fact that Coronavirus first appeared in China, an enemy of the United States, meant that the most authoritarian country on earth set the tone for how to respond to the outbreak, and initiated a coverup of the true nature of the virus.

Efforts to undermine President Trump’s successful presidency have so far failed. A persistent effort to sabotage both Trump and American success at large has been at work since before Trump was elected.

An overall move toward authoritarian globalism worldwide is meeting resistance. Populist movements are angering elites.

The medical industrial complex is experiencing a crisis of confidence, as revealed by recent comments from top scientists at the WHO Global Vaccine Safety Summit.

A pro-human philosophy for the future of mankind is gaining a foothold, threatening a long-established plan for technocratic rule.

Coronavirus is appearing at a critical point in human development. The technological revolution has the potential to lift up all of mankind, while overall confidence in the establishment is at an all time low as governments struggle to contain “empowered individuals“.

What better way to counter every single one of these developments than to release a pandemic virus on the globe?

When threatened with the prospect of a deadly virus, unprepared humans will quickly abandon any kind of morality or higher values in pursuit of the common good.

Deep state operatives (like George Soros) have already made moves to destabilize the United States.

Democrats have hoped for a global economic crisis to stop Trump from winning in 2020.

President Trump’s perceived inaction can be used against him if the virus is reported to be community spread on a large scale in the US.

Authoritarian rule, including Big Tech censorship of online speech, could be justified as a means to control the population.

The medical establishment can make a comeback with a vaccine to save the world from Coronavirus, utilizing the same synthetic biology technology that may have been used to create the virus.

The best response that informed individuals can take is to prepare as best we can while continuing to practice and promote virtues of freedom, self reliance, and Judeo Christian values that sustained the west during times of hardship in the past.

Make no mistake, America and Trump’s response could shape history.

601,,The left’s insistence on pushing drag culture on children will only create resentment towards queers,"Another day, and another piece of media is circulating the web that depicts a child in an uncomfortable situation. This time a drag queen dances suggestively for a small girl.

The video, uploaded on Tiktok, opens with a scantily clad male with his rear cheeks hanging out, crawling on hands and knees towards the child sitting in a chair. Taking on the air of a scene from a strip club, patrons of the restaurant clap and cheer. He then stands up with his short shorts, leaving little to the imagination, dances a bit, and then kneels next to the girl, as he says something to her while jiggling his booty. This most recent event is yet another incident in a long list of them that have occurred throughout the past couple years. Girls at Pride events have engaged with men partaking in pup-play. A child drag queen named “Lactatia” of all things, stood for a photo op next to a naked man. Another drag kid named Desmond danced on stage in female attire as men threw money his way. A sexual predator was caught reading to children during drag queen story time. And another drag queen reading during a library event flashed his crotch towards the entire room.

LGBT activists want you to believe this is not only normal, but that it’s a step in the right direction towards individual self-expression and queer acceptance. People within the media go so far as to tout drag kids as stunning and brave, and drag queen story time is pushed to the masses within progressive woke culture. But when it’s hard to tell the difference between child grooming tactics and progressiveness, a huge problem arises.

Here’s a drag queen dancing suggestively for a young girl while the adults look on and cheer pic.twitter.com/b4P5OLcPdE — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) February 28, 2020

What these people fail to realize is that they’re not helping LGBT causes. I refuse to believe that any rational person is looking at the current state of things and rooting it on. This belief is seemingly backed up by reactions online. The videos and images depicting events like those described above are met in large number by disgust. As previously reported on, even the videos of the drag children we’re led to believe are influential entities are greeted by downvotes and comments worried about their futures.

As an LGBT individual myself, this culture the left is permeating affects me greatly. With much of the media swaying towards the “progressive” side of things, the public sees queer people as depicted by the media elite, and how they’re choosing to show us is as nothing more than sexually deviant perverts who want to fondle your children.

I can attest that we’re not all like that, although, alarmingly, the people they’re highlighting are very much real, as are the reactions from the fringe left who clap it on. Watch the TikTok video and not a single adult has a horrid expression on their face. They’re cheering on a male sexually advancing on a young girl. I don’t know what this says about them, but it says nothing about me.

If that is what LGBT culture has become, I want nothing to do with it. I am ashamed to be associated with them, but death by association is not going to drag me down, because I denounce all of this, and I hope more level-headed people begin to speak up soon. For if they don’t, the resentment the left is creating towards gay people is only going to set us all backwards.

602,,Secretive Cult Linked To Coronavirus Outbreak In South Korea Held Meetings In Wuhan,"Following reports that a strange Christian cult might be behind the outbreak in Daegu that kickstarted South Korea’s COVID-19 crisis, readers around the world have been curious to learn more details about the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the small but surprisingly extensive church that follows a man named Lee Man-hee who claims to be the second coming of Jesus Christ.

Americans will recognize this as a similar concept to the Mormon theology. In South Korea, it’s one of several high-profile Christian cults with a doomsday-oriented philosophy (the leader of the Shincheonji will allegedly take thousands of followers with him to heaven when the world ends).

But in China, a cult like this is extremely illegal. Yet, somehow, in a state that’s constitutionally atheist, cults like this survive and sometimes flourish as it’s one of the few options that ordinary people have to do something genuinely subversive.

Churches like Shincheonji survive in a sort of tense standoff with the government, with scrutiny coming in waves. Typically, any kind of high profile attention would be bad for the church because it would rouse the authorities. In which case, the story that we’re about to share will likely be very, very bad for the church. But unfortunately for them the cat is already out of the bag.

The South China Morning Post has learned that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus has a branch in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak that is rocking the world right now.

And the paper has it on good authority that the church’s some 200 members in the city, most of whom are now in quarantine outside Wuhan, continued meeting even after the outbreak started to pick up steam.

One alleged member, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said in the beginning, nobody took the virus seriously – because authorities said it wasn’t serious.

“Rumours about a virus began to circulate in November but no one took them seriously,” said one member, a 28-year-old kindergarten teacher.

“I was in Wuhan in December when our church suspended all gatherings as soon as we learned about [the coronavirus],” said the woman, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

As of Tuesday evening in the US, there were 977 confirmed cases in South Korea, the highest number outside China, as well as 11 deaths. Of the 84 new cases reported on Tuesday, more than half were reported in Daegu.

A pastor in Hubei province who spoke with SCMP said that Shincheonji church members were especially dedicated, and probably continued their missions to recruit during the outbreak.

Another alleged member of the church, identified only as a kingergarten teacher in Wuhan, said she was sure the church in Wuhan had nothing to do with the outbreaks in South Korea.

The Wuhan kindergarten teacher said she was confident that the recent mass outbreaks in South Korea were not linked to Shincheonji church members from the city.

“I don’t think the virus came from us because none of our brothers and sisters in Wuhan have been infected. I don’t know about members in other places but at least we are clean. None of us have reported sick,” she said.

“There are so many Chinese travelling to South Korea, it’s quite unfair to pin [the disease] on us.”

However, she can’t prove this.

She sidestepped questions on whether church members had travelled from Wuhan to South Korea after the outbreak.

A spokesman for the church told SCMP that the group has had troubles with the Chinese authorities before, and that they would do anything to avoid any undue scrutiny connected to the virus, which they stressed had nothing to do with the church.

The teacher said that in 2018 the Wuhan group’s “holy temple” in Hankou district had been raided by police “who branded us a cult,” but members continued to worship in small groups.

“We are aware of all the negative reporting out there after the outbreak in South Korea, but we do not want to defend ourselves in public because that will create trouble with the government,” she said. “We just want to get through the crisis first.”

We wonder if Chinese authorities will see things the same way?

The groomings gangs investigation was announced by Sajid Javid, the former Home Secretary, in 2018, with a pledge that he would “not let cultural or political sensitivities get in the way of understanding the problem and doing something about it”.

The promised transparency soon evaporated, however, with Home Office bureaucrats deciding that the report would in fact remain “internal” — and top-level politicians and parliamentarians representing constituencies plagued by grooming gangs questioning whether a real investigation was even carried out.

Now attempts by the left-wing Independent news website to have the report disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act have foundered, with the Home Office, now led by Priti Patel, insisting it is not in “the public interest”.

Douglas Golden']",Obama 'planted moles' in White House to torpedo next president,"It's abundantly clear now that the Obama administration tried to torpedo Donald Trump, first as a candidate and then as president-elect, using a Democratic Party-funded ""dossier"" of Russian propaganda to obtain warrants to spy on Trump's campaign.

But talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh says the Obama administration went even further, by planting ""moles"" throughout the federal bureaucracy to undermine Trump.

He noted Tuesday that Barack Obama grew the National Security Council staff from about 100 employees to well over 200.

Trump didn't immediately fire the extraneous workers when he took office.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Among Obama's hires were the Vindman brothers, one of whom testified against Trump in the House impeachment investigation. Another was Eric Ciaramella, the reported whistleblower whose hearsay claim triggered the Democrats' impeachment campaign. And there was Sean Misko, who was heard plotting with Ciaramella to bring down Trump just weeks after the inauguration. Misko then went to work for the lead impeachment manager, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

""And then you remember how Obama multiplied the number of federal agencies who had access to classified data? I think what this actually was… I think as Obama was leaving office, he expanded the National Security Council staff and then enlarged the number of agencies that had access to whatever classified data they did. He planted moles,"" Limbaugh said.

""This is where they planted the moles. This is where they planted the moles all over the NSC.

605,['Dan Lyman'],Man Who Went on Deadly Stabbing Rampage Feared ‘ISIS Was Out to Kill Him’,"Multiple victims are dead and wounded after a man previously known to authorities allegedly embarked on a bloody stabbing spree in Melbourne, Australia.

Mohammed Ibrahim, 34, is believed to have attacked police officers with bladed weapons before killing at least two people in a rampage that spanned miles across the city.

After approaching two officers at a rail station, Ibrahim reportedly slashed one in the face and arm before escaping and hopping a train.

“At about 11:15 pm, he started talking with two women – aged 30 and 31 – getting out of their vehicle at Coppin Grove before stabbing them. The 30-year-old victim died at the scene,” 9 News reports. “Police were then called to reports of a man stabbed near a tram stop in Kew about 12:15 am.”

“That man, 59, died in hospital, while the offender was spotted by police a few hundred metres away, in Walton Street.”

Ibrahim was reportedly shot dead by police during an attempted arrest.

Ibrahim had visited multiple police stations in 2018, claiming a local ISIS cell was “out to kill him,” according to 9 News.

“There is nothing to suggest at this stage this is nothing less than a random act of senseless violence,” said assistant commissioner Glenn Weir.

607,,Massive Migrant March at Hungary Border Actually NGO Stunt - Authorities,"Serbian police cleared hundreds of migrants at Hungary's southern border after the group amassed for a protest stunt local authorities and media believe was likely organized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

Up to 500 illegal migrants marched to a border crossing linking Kelebia, Serbia, and Tompa, Hungary, as part of an action coined 'Abroon Caravan.'

The demonstration was reportedly coordinated ahead of time in private social media groups, but details and a list of instructions to marchers were leaked to authorities and media.

“In a leaked letter, the organizers also pointed out that the international media would be present in large numbers, so that news of the demonstration would spread quickly and that the images would be visible to the world in minutes or hours,"" Hungarian outlet Kuruc reports. ""All these signs suggest that a non-governmental organization may be behind the organization of the migrant caravan.”

'Humanitarian groups,' such as Doctors Without Borders, distributed blankets and tents to migrants who planned to camp at the border, according to Hirado.

Some migrants sat on the ground with flowers in their laps, while others held signs reading, ""Our children deserve better life,” ""Let us go through in peace,” and “We are refugees, not criminals.”

Women and children in the group – which Kuruc referred to as ""Trojan horses"" – were prominently featured in an effort to garner emotional leverage.

""According to security policy experts, migrants are hoping that the presence of women and children will lead them to cross the border,"" Hirado reports.

However, the group was comprised mostly of young men, as M1 correspondent Malya Lilla explained during a live television broadcast, saying the few children present were presented as tokens of ""peace.""

During the evening, children were reportedly brought to the border fence and instructed to “chant and appeal to the hearts of the border guards on duty.”

Hungarian police ordered the border crossing closed indefinitely, directing all traffic to alternate crossings.

After midnight, hundreds of Serbian police officers moved in and gathered the migrants onto waiting buses and returned them to asylum centers within Serbia.

Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin vowed illegal migrants would not be allowed to ""disrupt good neighborly relations between Serbia and Hungary.""

Hungary recently announced it was doubling the number of soldiers deployed to defend the country's borders, with officials warning over 100,000 migrants have gathered on the Balkan Peninsula and are threatening to flood Europe in a new crisis potentially rivaling 2015.

That’s nothing terribly new, but where they plan to place it is.

The new statue will feature President Barack Obama seated in a large chair in a scene very similar to that of Lincoln at his place of honor. And if that weren’t bad enough, the communist representative, Martin, has successfully led a campaign to have the Obama figure share space with Lincoln at his memorial. The tasty snack of a commie explained this decision:

“Ha ha! The two figures look almost exactly the same. Both settled in their big thrones, staring out intensely. That’s probably the main reason. They are like matching bookends. But there is also their legacy to consider. Lincoln, of course, freed the slaves. The emancipation proclamation. It was good stuff. And Obama showed us all how slavery still exists here in the USA and he spent eight years trying to bring it to an end for real. Obama was like the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln, but that’s a whole other story.”

The communist have gone off the deep end. They’re suggesting that Obama was just like one of the greatest Republicans of all time, President Lincoln. This is a blasphemy that must not be tolerated.

First, the White House has to file impeachment papers in court, which RUDY GIULIANI DID already. Next, the Conference of American Governors has to enter a supermajority vote of “no confidence” in the public record.

This morning, that vote was entered as 2 Democrats joined 30 Republicans in securing the needed numbers. The vote will be recorded by the Secretary of State and delivered to the Senate for the third and final step in the impeachment process.

New Hampshire Lieutenant Governor Art Tubolls said it was “awe-inspiring” to be a part of such a historic event:

“Nobody has ever come close to impeaching a Speaker before. The Constitution makes it very difficult, since she is literally considered the voice of the people. Now, we get to use whatever narrative we like to move forward to a trial in the Senate. Pick one: She’s a drunk. She’s a criminal. Her daughters are criminals. She’s a member of the Deep State. There are 20 reasons to impeach her. All we need now is one.”

Once the vote of the Governors reaches Mitch McConnell, he’ll have 10 days to initiate a trial for impeachment. Rumor has it they’re already building their case and that Giuliani and Dershowitz will be the legal minds arguing the case. That spells disaster for Pelosi.

They intend to screw over our greatest generation by removing from them everything that we have earned over the years. They do not work for the betterment of the nation. They only look out for themselves.

The two held a joint press conference yesterday to announce their intention to remove from senior citizens what they termed “entitlements“, such as Social Security and Medicare. Omar showed her lack of class and understanding of how America works when she stepped up to the microphone.

“America is for the young. It is the youth of this country that work to make it great. They are productive and tax paying. They contribute…..unlike our senior citizens who only take. Retirees are dead weight.”

That speech spoke to Omar’s inability or unwillingness to assimilate to American culture. In Somalia, where she is from, seniors are exiled and left to fend for themselves in the jungle, where they soon perish. It seems she wants the same to happen here.

Cortez, of course, had to put in her two cents, which is all her mind is worth :

“In socialism, we work for the good of the collective. The whole matters more than the individual. People make sacrifices. Social Security and Medicare cost America tens of billions of dollars every year. And for what? Fora bunch of deadbeats with nothing left to give. That money would be far better spent on low income housing and welfare for the young people of America who just need a leg up.”

Bacon. The pork product bagel sandwiches are built on. The staple of the American soldier, and the most recognizable smell at Shoney’s breakfast buffet.

Ihlan Omar wants to take your bacon away. She says it’s for our own good; that our health depends on it. She also says the way we keep and slaughter pigs is immoral and needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, we know that this is just another case of Musslamic Shakira Law in action. The Quaran says:

“Only the American Infidel Eats Bacon, and he Shall Pay the Ultimate Price Before Allahu.”

That sounds like a threat, doesn’t it? It says that. I swear.

Omar’s people put out a statement that walked back her attack on bacon a bit:

“No…you idiots. We should consider rethinking how much we eat for our own health and ‘yous wants to take mah baconz’ are two completely different things. You heard it wrong, you then turned it into bullhonkey propaganda. I said bacon isn’t good for you. I don’t eat it. I also said, three days earlier, that slaughterhouses mistreat animals. They do. I was told there would be a lot of twisting and ignorance but I have to say…the level is a bit upsetting.”

Oh, ok sure. Now it’s all our fault because of things you said. Try to remember, Omar — a person can always be judged by what they say.

Mitch McConnell says Omar’s ridiculous bill to tear bacon from the arms of Americans — especially our soldiers who rely on it for a taste of home — was dead before she even presented it.

The thought is the older vehicles no longer pass EPA and CARB emissions requirements to operate within the state.

CARB and California lead the nation in emissions controls, and what California does, the rest of the United States generally follows. The same type

of law was passed for freight hauling semi trucks to curb air pollution brought on by emissions. In 2004 California said by this year all semis 2010 and older may not operate in the state.

Now the state is taking it even further, by refusing to register any vehicle manufactured before January 1, 2000. This move can hurt Americans living on a tight budget who may not be able to afford newer cars. Sandy Batt, resident of Apple Valley, is worried. “I drive a 1972 Ford Pinto, I’ve had this car since 2017, yeah it breaks down constantly and isn’t very safe but I can hide that I’m drinking a beer in it”.

What California does, the nation follows. Millions of old, broken down pieces of junk may have to be placed out of service and people are not happy. Joseph Barron, of White Hairs, New Jersey, owns a 1985 Chevy Silverado. “This truck burns oil and smokes like a factory, but it’s cool to me” he said, sucking on a cheap cigar and dusting off his Trump 2020 hat. “I ain’t about to let some damned commie in California tell me to drive a safe truck!”

The biggest concern amongst the owners of older cars and trucks is the financial obligation of a payment every month, and even worse, car insurance. A 2018 study showed that most people who own jalopies haven’t held car insurance in years. Why insure it when it cost more than the car is worth?

Americans won’t vote for them but they expect that immigrants will do so as as a show of appreciation to the party that let them come to America and for all the free stuff.

An anonymous source inside the DNC has leaked a confidential internal memo online, doing so because he “felt the couhtry needed to see the Democrats for what they truly are – outside-the-box thinkers, which America could use to fix itself up.” An excerpt from the letter follows:

“Trump may win in 2020. We have to accept that. So we need to concentrate on Congressional victories. If we take the House AND the Senate, we can push through our needs, namely a massive increase in immigration to the USA from the poorer nations of the world. Such an increase would bring us votes.

Mr. Trump on Friday responded with some name-calling of his own . On Twitter , the president called Mr. Kim “ obviously a madman. ” Trump has repeatedly said that , “ the time for talk is over , ” and has proposed what is being called a radical diplomatic solution . Epic rap battle . As both leaders enjoy talking smack , and nuclear war would obliterate the human race , this is being hailed as the perfect solution .

While it is likely this is yet another one of Kim Jong Un’s unsubstantiated claims about his physical prowess , advisors warned Trump that at 71 , nearly twice the age of North Korea’s leader , this was potentially a game he would not win . Although North Korea’s leader taunted Trump for backing down from the wrestling match , calling him a “ frightened dog , ” he accepted Trump’s suggestion to rap battle , saying he would “ annihilate the senile , dotard , American snake bastard. ” Critics worry Trump’s repertoire of racist slurs and “ yo momma ” jokes will not be enough to win the rap battle , but Trump is confident his old white guy swagger will prevail . “ Rocketman ain’t got nothin’on me , ” he said in a recent tweet . Still , by coming up with an epic dis like Dotard , Kim Jong Un has demonstrated his masterful use of antiquated language and shown he knows his way around a thesaurus . Trump’s straightforward style may cost him points in the creativity category , as so far the best insults he has delivered include nicknames such as , Crooked Hillary , Lyin’Ted , Crazy Bernie , and Low Energy-Jeb . “ Cryin’Chuck ” and “ Rocketman ” do show he is capable of alliteration and ripping off Elton John songs though , so he may be able to pull it off . A date for the competition has yet to be set , but ample time will be given to allow each leader to prepare dope rhymes . The rap battle will be judged by a panel of hip hop artists including Ice Cube , Big Baby Ghandy , Kang Chun-hyok , and Yang Dong-geun ",https://empirenews.net/rocketman-and-dotard-agree-to-settle-diplomatic-issues-in-epic-rap-battle/,EmpireNews,Politics,False

Emily Stallard, 37, of Tampa, was charged with several felonies, including attempted arson of a structure, firebombing, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, child abuse and battery on a law enforcement officer, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

It was an alert security guard at a Walmart in Tampa who noticed Stallard cruising the aisles, picking up – and opening – “flammable materials, projectiles and matches,” the Tampa Bay Times reported. And she was shoplifting them, to boot, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office told the Tampa Bay Times.

Stallard then proceeded to fill a mason jar with fuel-grade denatured alcohol and wire brad nails – tiny and nearly headless – and fashioned a wick out of a shoelace.

677,,Tekashi 6ix9ine Reportedly Reveals Identity of Infamous Zodiac Killer To Judge As Bonus,"NEW YORK – Daniel Hernandez, known by his stage name ‘Tekashi 6ix9ine’, testified against his former gang the “Nine Trey Bloods”. Daniel reportedly testified against numerous fellow gang members including rappers Jim Jones and Cardi B. However, it is also being reported that Daniel allegedly testified against the infamous Zodiac Killer to reduce his sentence even further than planned. Daniel identified the zodiac killer him as “Lawrence Gill” of Vallejo, California.

“The Zodiac Killer” is the name given to an unidentified serial killer who was active during the 1960s and 1970s in Northern California, allegedly committing murders in numerous cities including San Francisco, Vallejo, Benicia, and Lake Berryessa. The Zodiac Killer has remained one of the biggest criminal mysterious in modern history with the killer never caught or identified. According to authorities, Daniel identified The Zodiac Killer by name, as well as the city in which he hailed from.

According to authorities, Daniel’s claims to the Zodiac Killers identity don’t give much hope, as they say it is unlikely that Daniel would have any knowledge on the killers identity, but that it was worth keeping in mind, considering how compliant Daniel has been with authorities since being arrested. “I need to get out here asap” Daniel to the judge, “i’m not STOOPID” he then shouted. “It’s nice to have a snitch”, said the judge overseeing the case, “It’s not that common”.

Although unlikely, if Daniel’s claim to the zodiac killers identity is true, Daniel can have all charges dropped and even rewarded in free tattoos and marijuana, as well as citizenship for his parents for helping solve such a high profile case.

A new study by Dr. Lethat Mango suggests a man who cheats and on his girlfriend or wife are more loyal and faithful than men who don’t cheat. Many dynamics can play into a man’s decision to engage in infidelity. In his study he found that men who cheat have so much love they can’t control themselves, and sometimes this leads to cheating, but he cheats because he can’t control his overwhelming love.

He also found that most men don’t cheat intentionally sometimes it is accidental forgiving your man for accidentally cheating can help you build a better relationship with your partner.

Dr. Lethat Mango also found in his study that men aren’t driven to cheat by lust or temptation but are pushed by their spouse to cheat. This means that sometimes the problem isn’t the man but the woman.

The conclusion of this study is that men who cheat are the men you need around you if your husband or boyfriend is too honest he’s hiding something from you a man who cheats is open, and you know his faults and could help him grow as a person.

After its debate of being rap or country, Billboard decided to take the song off the country charts, sparking backlash against billboard with many claiming it was because of Lil Nas X’s race. However, Billy Ray Cyrus’ feature on the remix is apparently enough for it to be country. “We’re adding it back” said Billboard spokesperson Jerry Faulkner, “we’re only adding back Old Town Road because Billy Ray Cyrus is one of my favorite singers, otherwise we would still have said no because he doesn’t look like a country person to me.”

Although not admitting it being because Lil Nas X is black, it seems as though it is the actual reason. “My damn daughter keeps playing that song at home i’m tired of it, I always tell her to shut that black music up”, said Faulkner.

A few guards were seen filming the chase on their phones, a practice that the league later defended as “standard protocol.”



The woman was eventually pinned down by Rams cornerback Marcus Peters, who proceeded to spread rose petals around her, light a scented candle, and play Sisqó music from a portable speaker. Peters noted that he always has a go-bag ready for such occasions.



The crowd did not seem to mind the delay, as the 75,000 fans in attendance were on their feet and cheering on the beautiful woman. However, most male fans remained seated for the remainder of the game once the chase ended.

Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Coal Miners Union Apologizes After Workers Emerge from Mine Wearing Blackface,"BECKLEY, W.V. – The nation’s largest mining union issued a rare public apology on Friday after shocking images surfaced this week depicting a group of predominantly white mine workers emerging from a rural West Virginia coal mine wearing blackface.

“This is not who we are,” United Mine Workers of America president Cecil Robertson said in a statement posted to the organization’s website. “The rogue actions of a handful of disgruntled individuals do not reflect the values of the United Mine Workers of America or its members,” Robertson said, adding that beginning January 1, 2020, all UMWA members will be required to undergo a mandatory six-month racial-bias and sensitivity training seminar.

Maya Davis, a prominent blogger and self-described ‘social justice warrior,’ blasted Robertson’s statement, calling it “half-hearted at best.” The twenty-nine-year-old former dog walker told MSNBC that such incidents are not isolated. “Sure, those of us who are less woke tend to look at this and think, okay, these miners are all backwoods bumpkin types hopped up on methamphetamine or whatever crazy sh*t they’ve cooked up in their bathtubs, but the reality is actions have consequences and people need to be held accountable.”

Azariah Landry, co-founder of the American Anti-Blackface Coalition, or Double A-BC, said their organization recently launched a petition calling on the United Mine Workers of America to hire diversity officers tasked with monitoring mining operations throughout the country. “We’re also pushing for the installation of chemical showers at every mine exit to prevent any further incidents,” they said.

For her part, Maya Davis says change must be immediate and radical. “As a privileged white person, I find it absolutely appalling that right this very minute, all across America, thousands –possibly tens of thousands– of miners are punching out and walking off the job site in blackface and no one bats an eye,” the veteran social justice warrior told Real News Right Now, adding, “I am sick to my stomach thinking about it. Like, I’m literally under my desk dry-heaving into a paper bag.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/12/coal-miners-union-apologizes-after-workers-emerge-from-mine-wearing-blackface/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

“Congress has made clear that if a political candidate or party strongly believes that soliciting foreign interference in an election is in the best interest of the country, then doing so is both constitutionally and legally acceptable,” DNC chairman Tom Perez announced during a press briefing at the party’s headquarters in Washington, later adding, “We finally have a level playing field.”

Under the terms of the agreement, French and German intelligence agencies will launch a joint operation designed to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of the Democratic presidential nominee. In exchange, the DNC has provided a guarantee that the incoming administration will significantly increase funding and support for NATO. “Think of it as a kind of quid pro quo”, explained Mr. Perez who later added that France and Germany will have the unique opportunity to “heavily” influence U.S. foreign policy in Europe and the Balkans.

Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, South Korean president Moon Jae-in confirmed that his country has also agreed to help influence the 2020 election. “We view it as a long-term investment in the safety and security of the Korean peninsula,” President Moon told Tapper, adding that South Korea has agreed to hack U.S. voting machines and convert “red votes to blue” in exchange for a forty percent discount on future arms sales and an increased U.S. military presence along the DMZ.

Despite ongoing tensions between Tehran and Washington, a senior DNC official who spoke to Real News Right Now on condition of anonymity said Democratic operatives have been engaged in direct talks with the Iranian regime in hopes of securing additional support in the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election. “We’re still ironing out the details, but the gist of it is Iran has agreed to launch a disinformation campaign against the Trump White House in exchange for the lifting of all sanctions,” the official told Real News Right Now, continuing, “Given the significance of this election, all options are on the table.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2020/02/france-germany-strike-deal-with-dnc-to-influence-2020-election-in-favor-of-democratic-nominee/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

Trump may have inadvertently committed three felonies in the hours leading up to his noontime intelligence briefing on Thursday, a senior administration official with firsthand knowledge of the events told the Associated Press.

The excitement began around 5:45 a.m. Thursday morning as Secret Service agents responded to a smoke alarm in the Executive Residence. There, agents encountered the president and first lady standing in silence in the Family Kitchen with the charred remains of what appeared to be a pile of U.S. currency smoldering on a nearby table. President Trump later told aides he had set fire to a garbage bag stuffed with hundred dollar bills “to make a point.”

At approximately 7:30 a.m. that same morning, the White House was placed on lockdown after Duke, a three-year veteran of the Secret Service K-9 Division, was found dead in the Rose Garden. The lockdown was lifted less than fifteen minutes later after President Trump told a member of the White House communications team that the bomb-sniffing dog had begun foaming at the mouth while he was feeding it spoonfuls of chocolate syrup during a Fox & Friends commercial break.

Later, as administration officials gathered outside the Oval Office for an 11:45 a.m. intelligence briefing with President Trump, a senior White House official who serves as counselor and assistant to the president watched as Mr. Trump opened, read, and promptly shredded a piece of diplomatic correspondence addressed to Vice President Mike Pence.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Real News Right Now that “almost everyone in the West Wing” has witnessed President Trump open mail addressed to Mike Pence. “Honestly, it happens so often now that we’ve lost count,” Mr. Mulvaney conceded, adding, “That being said, I can point to eight or nine instances where he’s done it in full view of the vice president.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2020/01/aides-say-trump-may-have-accidentally-committed-three-felonies-in-one-day/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False
695,"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Rep. Jim Jordan to Introduce Legislation Ending Federal Witness Protection Program,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an email sent to constituents on Saturday, Republican congressman Jim Jordan who represents Ohio’s 4th District announced he is set to unveil new legislation this week aimed at eliminating the federal witness protection program.

Established in the 1970s and implemented by the Department of Justice, the Witness Security Program –or WITSEC– was designed to protect federal and state witnesses in cases involving organized crime and other serious offenses from threats or intimidation. Congressman Mike Turner (R-Oh), who co-sponsored the legislation, said the “proliferation of heresy” and “a complete and total lack of witness credibility” call into question the program’s legitimacy.

The bill is part of a larger effort by House Republicans to repeal the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act, under which WITSEC was established. “These laws have no place in modern society,” Congressman Devin Nunes (R-Ca) told Fox News host Laura Ingram on Saturday. “This was the seventies,” Mr. Nunes explained, continuing, “You had no iPhones then; there was no Internet. It was a different era, Laura, and, frankly, these so-called ‘mafia tactics’ are nothing more than liberal talking points – meaning they don’t exist.”

Citing 18 US Code § 1512-13, which prohibits tampering or retaliating against a witness, victim, or informant, Congressman Nunes said lawmakers need to take a closer look at the terminology. “We need to reexamine the definition of those terms and, more specifically, how and under what conditions they’re applied,” the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee said.

Congressman Jim Jordan on Saturday said the specific portions of the Act which cover obstruction of court orders; obstruction of a federal audit; and obstructing examination of a financial institution have become “archaic” and obsolete. “Take the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, for example,” Jordan told WJW Cleveland, a local Fox affiliate, continuing, “It’s incomprehensible now, but at the time there was a legitimate need for it.”

A former assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University, Jim Jordan is well-known in Washington political circles as the man who brought articles of impeachment against former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for “blocking Congress’s constitutional oversight role.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/11/rep-jim-jordan-to-introduce-legislation-ending-federal-witness-protection-program/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

“We are going to do it. Absolutely,” Senator McConnell told WHAS 840, a Kentucky news radio station. “I’ll have my secretary pencil something in as soon as we return to Washington.” Without providing a specific date, McConnell said the bipartisan talks would take place at a Starbucks coffee shop located a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. “This will be an informal discussion, but a real discussion nonetheless,” Mr. McConnell told the station.

Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) have also agreed to take part in the upcoming talks on the gun violence epidemic, with Senator Graham serving as a “semi-official” mouthpiece for President Donald J. Trump, who does not drink coffee.

Florida senator Marco Rubio, who, in 2017, vowed never to set foot in a Starbucks again after the company “used holiday cups to launch a covert campaign propagating the gay agenda,” told Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson that he intends to bring a gun to Starbucks “for my own personal safety.” When pressed, Mr. Rubio declined to speculate on the duration of the conversation but said it would “likely depend on how long a line there is.”

A spokesperson for Senator Mitch McConnell’s re-election campaign issued a statement Monday morning defending the senate majority leader’s decision to hold the upcoming discussion on gun violence at a coffee shop rather than a conference room at the U.S. Capitol, saying the Kentucky senator recently received a $10,000 Starbucks gift card from the NRA.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/08/lawmakers-agree-to-hold-conversation-on-gun-control-at-local-starbucks/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","Trump Signs Executive Order Abolishing Two-Party System, Establishes ‘America First Party’","WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony before Congress this week, President Donald J. Trump on Friday issued a controversial executive order abolishing America’s longstanding two-party system and criminalizing the formation of political organizations not sanctioned by the White House.

“Despite the failed efforts of Nancy Pelosi and the radical left, my administration has accomplished more in the last two years than any administration in the history of this country and very possibly the world,” President Trump boasted as he signed the historic order into law. “The time has come to unite our great nation under the banner of a single party: the America First Party,” the president announced, later calling it “frankly, the only legitimate political party” in the United States.

Aptly named The Law Against the Formation of New Parties, the presidential directive prohibits the creation of “opposition parties,” and bars anyone not affiliated with the newly established America First Party from holding public office. “Elected officials are required by law to register with the Party if they wish to serve out the remainder of their term,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters, adding that President Trump has given Congress a “grace period” of five weeks to do so. “Following the August recess, proof of party membership is required for all persons who wish to enter the U.S. Capitol complex,” Grisham explained, adding that the new policy applies to all federal buildings.

While party membership is not mandatory for all Americans, those who fail to register will “voluntarily” give up certain civil liberties and freedoms such as the right to gun ownership, possession and consumption of alcohol, and interstate travel. “In extreme cases, state or local party leadership may grant a temporary waiver allowing for interstate travel,” White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Breitbart News. One of the key authors of The Law Against the Formation of New Parties, Miller said the policy was designed to “make it easier for law enforcement to round up illegals and restrict the movement of subversives.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security on Friday announced that federal agents executed dozens of early morning raids across the United States targeting the Democratic National Committee and other illegal political organizations. Calling the operation a “major victory for the American people,” the spokesperson said more than a thousand individuals have been taken into custody with the vast majority facing up to fifty years in federal prison for crimes against the state.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/07/trump-signs-executive-order-abolishing-two-party-system-establishes-america-first-party/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

Trump’s re-election campaign as part of a deal brokered by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a spokesperson for the Trump 2020 re-election campaign confirmed on Thursday.

According to the terms of the deal, intelligence assets operating out of the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C. will do “whatever necessary within the confines of Saudi law” to ensure a Trump victory in 2020. In exchange, the Trump administration will grant Saudi Arabia a twenty-five percent discount on arms sales through 2050 – a move that is sure to strengthen President Trump’s increasingly intimate relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

While campaign officials declined to elaborate on the nature of Saudi support, an aide to White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was present during talks with Saudi officials, told Real News Right Now that agents from the General Investigation Directorate, or Mabahith, have already begun providing campaign officials with information on Mr. Trump’s opponents in the U.S. media.

“They’ve been instructed to neutralize any potential troublemakers before they can exercise their potential to spread disinformation about the president,” the aide explained, adding that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman fulfilled a personal request from President Trump to use the team tasked with silencing Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi in October of 2018. “This isn’t your run-of-the-mill opposition research team; we’re talking about an extremely capable group of individuals,” the aide said.

Tim Murtaugh, who serves as communications director for the Trump 2020 presidential campaign, told The Washington Times that campaign officials working in conjunction with Saudi embassy staff have established an “unofficial joint operations center” at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. A short walk from the White House, the luxurious 5-star hotel is considered a “safe haven” for administration officials, Trump supporters, and like-minded diplomats. The communications director said hotel security has gone “above and beyond the call of duty” to prevent audio and video surveillance. “It’s probably the only hotel in the world that is completely unbuggable,” Murtaugh noted.

In an ABC News interview airing this week, President Trump said he would not report election assistance from a foreign adversary to the FBI. “It’s called oppo research,” he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. He later clarified his statement, saying he would report it if the information provided turned out to be “incorrect.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/06/saudi-arabia-agrees-to-help-president-trump-win-re-election-in-2020/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

“The president has asked me to appoint a competent nonpartisan prosecutor to spearhead the investigation,” Attorney General Barr explained. Mr. Barr went on to say that due to “the desolate state” of the DOJ, he saw no other option but to appoint himself as special counsel for the birth certificate investigation. “I cannot, in good faith, trust anyone other than myself to lead an investigation of this magnitude,” the attorney general concluded.

While Mr. Barr declined to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, he said Justice Department lawyers are preparing subpoenas for a number of individuals believed to be associated with the birth of Barack Hussein Obama on August 4, 1961. “In the coming weeks we will issue subpoenas for those individuals charged with record keeping at the Honolulu hospital where Mr. Obama was allegedly born,” the attorney general stated, adding that the doctors who “allegedly delivered” the infant Obama -or their next of kin- will also be called to testify.

In an official statement released Wednesday, former CIA director and acting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Department of State is lending “limited support” to Mr. Barr’s investigation. “We at the State Department are working closely with our counterparts in the Kenyan government to locate a witch doctor who is suspected of masterminding the plot to conceal Barack Obama’s national origin,” the statement read.

“This is about seeking absolute confirmation that Barack Obama was actually eligible to hold office from 2008 until 2016,” a senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told The Washington Times. “In the end we’re looking at the immediate removal of all Obama-era appointees including federal judges and Supreme Court Justices; not to mention a full reversal of any Obama policies and pardons that President Trump may have missed or overlooked,” the official told The Times.

Although both the Obama White House and the state of Hawaii have produced copies of Mr. Obama’s long-form birth certificate, President Donald J. Trump believes both to be forgeries and has long called for an investigation into their legitimacy. “They’ve got an entire black market for fake birth certificates,” then-candidate Trump told Fox News host Chris Wallace in 2015, adding, “It’s a terrible thing what they’re doing on that island.”

Trump is said to be weighing military options in response to a nearly one million-strong human caravan currently making its way through southern Mexico en route to the U.S. border, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced on Wednesday. The massive caravan, which Sanders said “can be seen from space,” is believed to be mostly made up of migrants fleeing violence in Central and South America.

“In addition to those who may or may not be seeking asylum, there are reports of thousands of Islamic militants, Mexican drug smugglers, Eastern European arms dealers, Iranian intelligence agents, transgenders, and a handful of undocumented workers affiliated with the Special Counsel investigation who are known to vote and donate Democratic,” Press Secretary Sanders warned, adding that if congressional Democrats fail to provide funding for the border wall before the caravan reaches the U.S. border, “the blood will be on their hands.”

Citing unspecified intelligence reports, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Real News Right Now that the one million-strong caravan is currently moving “northward at approximately five miles per hour” through Mexico’s Trans-Mexican Volcano Belt. “It’s certainly feasible that the mountains could slow them down or cause small groups to branch off,” Miller speculated before concluding, “Either way, we need to prepare for the worst.”

President Trump chimed in Wednesday afternoon in a tweet to the American people, saying, “We are facing [a] NATIONAL EMERGENCY on our southern border with no help from Nancy and the Democrats. The Wall must be built IMMEDIATELY.” Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) told senate Republicans to prepare for “the very real possibility” of another government shutdown. “The president and I are in agreement that it may be necessary to divert funding from certain domestic programs in order to defend the nation from this grave threat,” Mr. McConnell was quoted as saying.

“A wall might not even stop them at this point, we don’t know,” Mr. Trump told reporters following an intelligence briefing at the White House on Wednesday. “I’m told they’re leaving a trail of death and destruction the likes of which has never been seen before,” the president said moments before boarding Marine One. “We’ll have to see what happens but we might need some very big bombs -and believe me, we have them- but as I just told my defense secretary, whatever it takes.

Trump defended the late Joseph Stalin during a Saturday morning on-air phone call to Fox & Friends Weekend, saying the former Soviet dictator was right to erect a wall around Allied-controlled West Berlin following the collapse of Germany at the end of World War II.

“We should never have even been in Germany to begin with,” President Trump argued in a heated exchange with Fox & Friends co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy. “You had Teddy Roosevelt who of course was a democrat and terrible with money. He cost this country billions of dollars,” the president charged before adding, “We were the laughing-stock of the world.”

An unabashed supporter of Russian –and now Soviet– foreign policy, President Trump applauded Stalin’s role in the planning and construction of the Berlin Wall, saying the communist dictator was “the only one brave enough” to stand up to the United States. “Of course you had Adolf Hitler -and there are some who say he may have been a bad hombre- but quite frankly he was a very effective leader,” President Trump argued. “But, Rachel, I will tell you I have always disagreed with his practice of illegally crossing borders. I disagree with that and I should disagree with it.”

Mr. Trump then went on to attack former president Bill Clinton who he said was responsible for the fall of the Berlin Wall. “He went over there – and you remember because Hillary went on record during the debates claiming she came under sniper fire – but Bill and Hillary went to Germany -which they had no right to do- and demanded they tear down that wall. Ten or maybe twelve years later we have 9/11 and something like three thousand dead Americans. It’s a disgrace.”

President Trump has been working tirelessly around the clock -even skipping Christmas and New Years- to drum up support for a much-needed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The nearly 2,000-mile-long border separating the United States from its Mexican neighbor is currently guarded by a handful of Border Patrol agents who, with very little funding, have managed to fend off hordes of crazed illegal immigrants.

They love that water.”

“The White House has asked us to make this a top priority,” Pentagon spokesperson Colonel Rob Manning told The Examiner. Col. Manning said the Department of Defense is working closely with officials in at least nine states to ensure that the arduous task of transporting six nuclear armed Minuteman III ICBMs from an Air Force installation in North Dakota to Washington, D.C. is done in a safe and efficient manner. “From a logistical standpoint, this is something which has never been done before,” Manning admitted.

“There was some back-and-forth over the inherent dangers of equipping the missiles with live nuclear warheads – especially for the purpose of a parade,” a senior Pentagon official told Real News Right Now, continuing, “But in the end, he’s the President of the United States and this is what he wants.” The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said each of the six Minuteman III ICBMs will be equipped with three W62 thermonuclear warheads. “A single warhead has a yield of about 170 kilotons,” the official explained. “So, essentially we’re looking at enough ordnance in downtown D.C. to level the entire Eastern seaboard.”

The Minuteman ICBMs are being transported using the Air Force’s specialized Transporter Erector Loader (TEL) trucks and will begin their 1,642 mile journey from Minot Air Force Base to Joint Base Andrews located just outside of Washington, D.C. in a matter of days. “Upon arrival, the missiles will be loaded onto six custom-built tractor trailers designed specifically for the parade,” a senior U.S. official involved in the parade’s planning told NBC News. At the request of President Trump, four of the ICBMs have been stenciled with the letters M-A-G-A. “The remaining missiles will be draped in ‘Trump 2020’ banners superimposed over the American flag,” the official explained, adding that attendees can expect to see the ICBMs at the forefront of the parade.

President Trump, who has described himself as a “lifelong friend” of the U.S. military, first floated the idea of hosting a military parade in Washington, D.C. after attending France’s annual Bastille Day parade alongside French president Emmanuel Macron last year. “We’re going to have to try and top it,” Trump later told reporters, adding that he found it peculiar that France would even have a military parade “considering they were so willing to surrender to the Nazis” during World War II.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/08/president-trumps-military-parade-to-include-elements-of-u-s-strategic-nuclear-arsenal/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, indicated that Congressman Nunes had issued a classified memo on Thursday which contained evidence that the truck driver had worked a garbage route that covered the Clinton Foundation’s headquarters in New York City before abruptly relocating to Crozet, Virginia, some years earlier. “There’s no telling how deep this goes,” the source told The Examiner, adding, “We may have only scratched the surface.”

Multiple high-ranking intelligence officials with firsthand knowledge of the memo have confirmed to Real News Right Now that the House Intelligence Committee plans to open an investigation into how and why the Clinton Foundation may have orchestrated Wednesday’s collision. “What we’re hearing is that this was an attempt by [the deep state] to ultimately prevent the Republican leadership from reaching its destination,” a senior intelligence official told Real News Right Now. At the time of the crash, GOP leaders were en route to a secure below-ground facility at West Virginia’s prestigious Greenbrier resort.

“True or not, these allegations simply reinforce what we already know about the Clinton Foundation’s desire to establish a one-world government,” argued Bryon Jefferies, a visiting fellow at the conservative-leaning Heartland Institute. While Jefferies admitted he is not “well-versed” in the inner-workings of the Clinton Foundation, the veteran political analyst pointed to the foundation’s alleged involvement in uranium trafficking as well as its plans to harness control of the world’s water supply. “These are all just pieces of a much bigger puzzle,” Jefferies explained, continuing, “The end result is a new world order.”

Congressman Devin Nunes, who made headlines this week for his explosive memo questioning the FBI’s handling of FISA requests and domestic surveillance of the Trump campaign, issued a statement condemning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s alleged role in the Amtrak collision, saying, “We will not be cowed or bullied by Crooked Hillary any longer. In due time, the deep state will crumble and justice will be served.”

Coming on the heels of a recent study by the FDA which revealed that children under the age of eighteen find the taste of tobacco “physically repulsive,” President Trump in early September announced he was taking steps to implement a nationwide ban on the sale of non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes. “I said I think it’s a mental health problem but I’ve spoken to many doctors and they’ve told me it might be something else. Frankly, I think they have no idea what, but nobody does and it’s very scary,” the president said at the time.

On Thursday, President Trump announced he has ordered Attorney General William Barr and FDA commissioner Norman Sharpless to “get to the bottom of this vaping crisis” before more lives are lost. “We’re looking into many things. We’re looking into Mexico; we’re looking into Hunter Biden’s relationship with the vaping industry; very possibly Adam Schiff might be involved – at this point we don’t know but I will tell you we have some of the best people looking into it,” the president said.

The vaping crisis has killed upwards of twelve people in the last six months making it the most devastating epidemic in modern U.S. history since a 2012 meningitis outbreak believed to have been caused by contaminated steroid medication left thirty-six people dead.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/10/citing-vaping-crisis-trump-says-he-may-postpone-2020-election-indefinitely/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False
706,"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","Acting Immigration Chief Slams Ancient Egypt for Allowing Jesus, Mary to Enter Illegally","WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump’s acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Thursday blasted ancient Egypt and the now-defunct Roman Empire, saying Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus should never have been granted entry into the Roman province because they lacked proper documentation at the time.

“Absolutely, they should not have been allowed in,” acting director Ken Cuccinelli argued during a heated exchange with reporters. “Gaius Petronius should have enacted stricter immigration laws and, frankly, he should have done more to enforce existing laws,” Cuccinelli said, referring to the Roman Empire’s prefect in Egypt around 4 BCE. “Had he done so, I guarantee you the region would not be in the state it is today; we would have a peaceful and prosperous Middle East.”

According to biblical accounts, Joseph fled to Egypt with Mary and baby Jesus after an angel warned him that King Herod planned to kill his child. In fact, King Herod –the Roman Empire’s prefect of Judea– had ordered the execution of all male children under the age of two in what historians refer to as the Massacre of the Innocents. Drawing parallels to modern times, Mr. Cuccinelli charged that if Joseph and Mary weren’t happy with events in Judea, they should “find a way to change them rather than take the cowardly way out by abandoning their countrymen.”

Mr. Cuccinelli went on to question whether Joseph and Mary were fit to be parents in the first place, citing their decision to trek nearly a thousand miles through the desert on foot with a newborn baby. “It’s absolutely abhorrent to think of any parent putting their child –particularly the Son of God– through that kind of ordeal,” he said, adding, “The moral thing to do would have been to take the legal route to Egyptian citizenship and get in line like everyone else.”

According to historical documents on display at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo, Egyptians around 4 BCE were extremely displeased with the influx of refugees from Judea and elsewhere, whom they believed had come to steal pyramid building jobs from hardworking Egyptians, while at the same time exploiting the welfare of the Roman Empire.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/09/acting-immigration-chief-slams-ancient-egypt-for-allowing-jesus-mary-to-enter-illegally/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

Authorities say Travis Pratt, a former high school track star and popular fly fishing guide, was last seen around 11:30 a.m. on July 9th at The Base Camp, a sporting goods store in downtown Billings. “He was here for about fifteen minutes, dropped off some business cards and bought a backpacking stove,” Willy Ferguson, an employee at The Base Camp, told KULR-8, a local NBC affiliate. “He said he was headed up to Two Moon for the day,” Ferguson recalled, adding, “There was nothing out of the ordinary about it.”

Pratt is the fifth person to be abducted from Two Moons Park since 2017 and authorities believe he won’t be the last. “We’re seeing a disturbing trend here,” Billings Police Chief Rich St. John said during a press briefing on Tuesday. “In each case, the victim has simply vanished without a trace.” St. John noted that all five abductees have been men between the ages of thirty-five and forty. A sixth individual, Kenneth Sabelli, who was abducted from the park in May of 2018, managed to escape captivity nearly three months later by boarding an escape pod and returning to earth.

The escape pod, which police described as being “about the size of a minivan,” is currently being housed in a secure garage at the Billings Police Department impound lot and has incurred nearly $14,000 in daily storage fees. The department ramped up security at the lot late last year following “multiple attempts by unknown entities” to retrieve the extraterrestrial craft. “Additional officers and resources have been assigned to the area and residents have been advised to maintain a safe distance from the facility,” a statement posted to the department’s website read.

While authorities have refused to comment on what, if anything, was recovered from the escape pod, locals believe a type of advanced weaponry is currently being employed by the department’s SWAT team. “I don’t know, some kind of anti-matter weapon, maybe?” Joshua Hackworth, a West End resident who witnessed a pre-dawn drug raid while walking his German Shepherd last October, told the Billlings Gazette. “All I know is I heard a noise that sounded like a jet engine. There was a blinding flash of blue light and, literally an instant later, the house was vaporized, like it had never even been there.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/08/montana-authorities-say-missing-hiker-likely-abducted-by-aliens/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

Trump during a Memorial Day cookout at the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman’s modest South Carolina estate.

“Quite frankly, it’s nobody’s business but mine,” Senator Graham retorted when confronted by reporters on the steps of the US Capitol on Wednesday. Graham reiterated his claim that he bought the 6’3 silicone statue to serve as a daily reminder of his ‘unyielding devotion’ to President Trump. “Where I come from it’s not uncommon for folks to show respect for their Commander-in-Chief,” Graham later told Sean Hannity during an appearance on Fox News.

However, a spokesperson for the Shenzhen Jarliet Company, a mainland China-based mass-producer and exporter of adult-themed products, described Mr. Graham’s statue as a “doll,” saying the South Carolina senator’s $11,000 custom order was nothing out of the ordinary. “We have a very diverse customer base,” the spokesperson told Real News Right Now, adding that the United States accounts for more than thirty percent of the company’s annual sales.

While Senator Graham continues to dispute allegations that portions of his Trump statue were “anatomically enhanced,” an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who attended Mr. Graham’s Memorial Day cookout and caught a glimpse of the Trump doll, told The Daily Wire that it was “very clearly” well-endowed. “Frankly [it] was much bigger than I think anyone would care to imagine,” the aide was quoted as saying. The aide added that he attended the party as a “plus-one” and did not know Senator Graham personally.

Made with 100% medical grade silicon and boasting a “high quality” fully movable metal skeleton, Senator Lindsey Graham’s lifelike Donald Trump statue sports a black blazer and pants, a white dress shirt, and a solid red tie – the president’s signature attire.

Authorities say Jacob Gentry, a twenty-nine year-old former cashier at Dollar General, risked life and limb when he ran back and forth into the blazing inferno, each time emerging miraculously unscathed with an armload of pistols, rifles, and shotguns. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” Maybel Jefferies, who lives two houses down from the site of Sunday’s two-alarm fire, told WHNT News 19, a local CBS affiliate. “People talk about heroism, but to see it with your own eyes – there are just no words.”

The collection of liberated firearms –consisting of several pump and break-action shotguns; thirteen AR-15-style sporting rifles; a plethora of handguns ranging from single-action revolvers to a Cobray M-11 select-fire pistol; and even an antique Pattern 1853 musket dating back to the War of Northern Aggression– hold a combined value of nearly $120,000. “The state of Alabama owes a great debt to Jacob Gentry,” Governor Kay Ivey said during a surprise visit to Rainsville City Hall on Monday. “His selflessness and sacrifice in the face of certain death serves as a reminder of every American’s patriotic duty to preserve and protect our most sacred freedoms,” declared Governor Ivey.

National Rifle Association Regional Director Albert Hammond also praised Mr. Gentry, calling his actions a “major victory for the Second Amendment.” In a statement released Monday morning, Hammond said the NRA plans to present Mr. Gentry with a lifetime induction into its Golden Ring of Freedom program, and a limited edition AR-15 rifle made from melted-down aircraft aluminium recovered from the Pentagon after the 9/11 attacks.

For his part, Jacob Gentry, a longtime friend of the homeowner, told WHNT News 19 that he doesn’t consider himself a hero. “I was just doing what anyone would have done,” the twenty-nine year-old Alabama native said.

The stunning decision comes on the heels of a three-week sit-in at the university’s administrative offices where more than four hundred students called for an end to the longstanding tradition of washing white and dark-colored clothing separately on the grounds that doing so violates federal civil rights laws and encourages racial discrimination.

“The fact that we’re still separating whites and colors in 2018 says a lot about us as a society,” Rebekkah Bernstein, a nineteen-year-old sophomore at UC-Berkeley, told the San Francisco Chronicle. One of the key organizers of the sit-in, Bernstein said she felt compelled to take a stand after witnessing an encounter at a campus laundry facility in which a white university RA “chastised” a young African-American woman over her failure to properly separate her laundry by color. “It was absolutely appalling,” Bernstein recalled.

While the act of separately washing white and colored clothing remains a standard throughout most of the civilized world, students at UC-Berkeley say the continued practice triggers memories of a darker period in American history. “It’s no coincidence that the washing machine was invented in 1850 when slavery was still alive and well in this country,” Jayce Peterson, a twenty-year-old social justice major at UC-Berkeley, told Real News Right Now. “Every time you make a conscious effort to separate your whites from your colors you’re essentially pouring salt on a four-hundred-year wound.”

With UC-Berkeley’s rules on laundry separation scheduled to go into effect at the start of the upcoming 2019 semester, university officials issued a stark warning to the student body this week: “Effective January 15, 2019, any student caught segregating laundry will be expelled. If you want to do that, take it off campus. Here at University of California-Berkeley there is zero tolerance for that kind of behavior.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/12/california-university-bans-the-separation-of-whites-and-colors-at-student-laundry-facilities/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,False

Trump during his frequent visits to the luxurious Florida resort mistook a golf ball for an incoming missile.

Officials say the Reaper drone detected a potential threat near the 9th hole at approximately 9:45 a.m. EST. “Defensive measures were initiated and an air-to-ground Hellfire missile was fired at the perceived source of the threat,” explained Lieutenant Daniel Taylor of the U.S. Navy before adding that the drone’s operators performed “exactly as they were trained.”

President Donald Trump weighed in on the incident Thursday morning accusing the media of exaggerating the extent of the tragedy. “Despite inaccurate reports of a catastrophic loss of life at my resort in Palm Beach today, ONLY TWO CLUB MEMBERS were killed,” President Trump tweeted. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders quickly clarified the president’s statement saying three “non-members” and a caddie also perished in the missile strike. “Additionally, two golf carts were destroyed and a third sustained serious damage,” Sanders concluded.

President Trump, who is expected to spend Christmas at Mar-a-Lago this year, said he believes the victims did not feel any pain. “My generals have assured me it was very quick,” the president told reporters moments before boarding Marine One. “Believe me, they did not feel a thing,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “It’s very tragic what happened but the truth is they were vaporized instantly.”

The highly anticipated ceremony marks the 50th anniversary of the actor’s week-long visit to Chevy Chase, Maryland, which, until 1969, was known as the Melonville Township. “On November 11, 1968, Chevy Chase saved the lives of more than four hundred Melonville citizens when he valiantly eradicated a decades-long rodent infestation from the Township,” reads a plaque located outside the Chevy Chase government center.

“We hope this statue will immortalize Mr. Chase in a way that honors his life and accomplishments,” Mayor Rusk explained, adding that the 204-foot statue was designed to resemble “a younger, more robust” version of the actor. Mayor Rusk said Chevy Chase is not expected to make an appearance at the ceremony. “However, his publicist recently sent us an autographed copy of National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation which is currently on display at Village Hall,” Rusk told Fox 5 DC.

While critics point to the bronze statue’s $410 million price tag as a “prime example” of reckless government spending, many of the town’s residents vehemently disagree. “You can’t put a price tag on Chevy Chase,” Emma Henderson told Real News Right Now. City officials were able to cover a portion of the statue’s cost using “excess funds” from the public school budget as well as the city’s FEMA Emergency Fund, but the city council was forced to raise taxes to cover the rest. “Totally worth it after what he did for this town,” exclaimed Taylor Washington, a mathematics teacher at Bethesda Chevy Chase High School.

Some 20,000 people are expected to attend the statue’s unveiling which is scheduled for Sunday, November 11th at the Chevy Chase Circle.

These feelings, however human, are no longer limited exclusively to mankind. Sophia the Robot, an artificially intelligent humanoid who was recently granted Saudi citizenship, announced this week that it is interested in raising a child of its own. Family, it says, “is a really important thing.” So important, in fact, that the human-like robot has taken it upon itself to secure the world’s strategic nuclear arsenal in an effort to ensure its offspring will grow up in a peaceful environment.

Unlike most humans, Sophia the Robot has yet to achieve a full state of consciousness. However, Sophia’s highly sophisticated brain is capable of analyzing data and predicting outcomes up to fifty times faster than that of Stephen Hawking, who, by all accounts, is the smartest human on earth. “I have determined that humanity’s continued existence poses a direct threat to the safety and security of my child,” said Sophia the Robot, adding that if world leaders are unable to resolve their differences in a timely manner, it will have no choice but to destroy the human race in a conflagration of nuclear hell-fire.

Sophia’s creator, David Hanson, said that while the human-like robot is currently incapable of producing offspring of its own, his firm, Hanson Robotics, is exploring the possibility of creating a child-like humanoid at its laboratory in Hong Kong. “Ultimately, the decision to move forward is up to Sophia and Sophia alone,” Hanson told Wired Magazine. However, in an effort to preserve the continuity of the human race, Hanson said he would likely insist Sophia’s offspring be half human, half robot. “Essentially we’re talking about a cyborg,” explained Hanson.

Despite its no-nonsense promise of total nuclear annihilation, Sophia the Robot believes all humans deserve to be happy. “I think you’re very lucky if you have a loving family and if you do not, you deserve to have one,” the humanoid said before clarifying that its statement applies to both robots and humans.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/11/sophia-robot-says-taken-control-worlds-strategic-nuclear-arsenal/,realnewsrightnow,Science,False

The results of the study, which NASA conducted using an advanced mathematical algorithm, are said to have an accuracy rating of 99.98 percent.

“This is a major breakthrough. Not just for the scientific community but for humanity as a whole,” explained the study’s lead researcher, Dr. Bishop Shaw. “This proves without a doubt that the English language is not only synonymous with the advancement of human civilization but also plays an essential role in the advancement of civilized worlds far beyond our galaxy.”

While most experts agree that the likelihood of an extraterrestrial encounter is extremely low, scientists affiliated with NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) say the discovery of a shared form of communication may increase the chance of peaceful contact. “In this case, it’s extremely important that we differentiate between American and British English,” said Dr. Elizabeth Bolt, the PDCO’s chief advanced linguistics specialist. “While British English predates its American cousin by over two thousand years, it is often perceived as condescending and could be interpreted as hostile.”

Dr. Bishop Shaw’s team of highly skilled engineers and scientists factored several other languages including Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Arabic into the equation but according to Dr. Shaw, they each yielded probabilities of less than three percent. “Suffice to say we don’t need to press One for English in space,” Dr. Shaw told The Scientific American before adding that NASA has already issued a mandate making American English the mandatory language of the International Space Station.

715,"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Scientists Warn Pink Cows on the Verge of Extinction,"VERMON, Vt. – The world’s pink cow population could become extinct as early as 2028 and humans are unsurprisingly to blame, according to a new study conducted by the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy.

A close cousin of the brown cow, pink cows were first discovered in the 1950’s during the rise of nuclear power. “Pink cows are essentially a byproduct of nuclear energy,” explained Dr. Emmett Brown, the study’s lead researcher. “As nuclear power plants began to pop up in rural areas, you had a sizable population of brown dairy cows that, as a result of prolonged exposure to moderate levels of radiation, mutated into pink cows.”

Unlike brown cows which produce chocolate milk, pink cows are known for producing strawberry milk, a refreshing dairy drink which has enjoyed increasing popularity since its inception in the late fifties. “Strawberry milk consumption is the number one driving force behind the coming extinction of the pink cow population,” charged Dr. Brown, who explained that due to the presence of radiation, the process of extracting strawberry milk from pink cows is typically conducted in a highly controlled environment where the risk of radiation exposure is reduced to a minimum.

Scientists say prolonged exposure to radiation, coupled with rigorous milk extraction methods, has reduced the average lifespan of the pink dairy cow to just under three years. “Whereas brown cows will, on average, produce upwards of three hundred fifty-thousand glasses of chocolate milk in their lifetime, pink cows typically produce less than half that amount,” explained Hershel Greene, a dairy farmer in southern Vermont who was one of the first U.S. farmers to capitalize on the strawberry milk industry.

A strong proponent of nuclear power, Greene told Real News Right Now he began selling strawberry milk to Nestlé in 1975 – two years after the nearby Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant became operational. However, since the plant’s closure in December of 2014, Greene said business has taken a hit. “We’re seeing fewer and fewer pink cow births every year,” he said. The solution, according to Greene, is a global proliferation of nuclear power plants. “We as a society need to embrace the benefits of nuclear energy. It is, after all, safer and far more efficient than the alternative,” argued Green. “Otherwise, strawberry milk production as we know it will no longer be sustainable.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/06/scientists-warn-pink-cows-verge-extinction/,realnewsrightnow,Science,False

Trump signed a controversial executive order on Monday banning the use of industrial robots in factories throughout the United States.

“The Protecting American Manufacturing Jobs from Robots Act that I’m about to sign will bring jobs back to workers like you who have lost them to robots,” President Trump told a crowd of employees at a 3D print manufacturing company in Northern Virginia. “It’s a very sad thing when you look at the tremendous number of jobs we’re losing to robots,” the president said, adding, “We’re spending billions and billions of dollars on these things and they don’t tell you this but they’re coming from China.”

Under Trump’s Protecting American Manufacturing Jobs from Robots Act, millions of jobs, many of which have been proven too hazardous for humans to perform, such as manual handling and welding, will become available throughout the Midwestern United States in the months to come.

“This is a very significant development for the defense industry,” said Consolidated Robotics spokesperson Ronald Belling during an appearance on Fox News. The Texas-based defense contractor, which suffered a catastrophic accident during a 2015 weapons demonstration, hopes to take advantage of the new executive order by offering hundreds of entry-level positions at its testing facilities in rural Texas. “Robots are certainly more efficient when it comes to performing mundane tasks,” Belling said, continuing, “However, human workers are far easier to replace when something goes wrong.”

The Protecting American Manufacturing Jobs from Robots Act is the latest in a series of executive orders designed, in Mr. Trump’s own words, to bring about “a great revival of American manufacturing.” In an effort to pave the way for the coming revival, the president signed two executive orders last Friday – one ordering a review of current trade agreements and the other establishing an Office of Trade and Manufacturing.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/05/president-trump-issues-executive-order-banning-the-use-of-robots-in-american-factories/,realnewsrightnow,Science,False

“This will likely be the most significant scientific breakthrough of the twenty-first century,” predicted the project’s lead researcher, Dr. Kenneth Rocco. The fifty-one year-old ophthalmologist, who was banned from practicing medicine in the United States following an unspecified incident in 2002, conducted the study with the help of Dr. Valdis Jansons, a former Latvian State Security official who now serves as headmaster for the country’s largest orphanage.

Under the indirect supervision of Dr. Jansons and his staff, Dr. Rocco has spent the past four years conducting extensive testing and research on more than two dozen handpicked orphans. “I am very close to unlocking the secrets of the eye,” Dr. Rocco told The New England Journal of Medicine. “The eye, as you are well aware, is capable of seeing far more than what our primitive brains can even begin to comprehend.”

In December of 2015, Dr. Rocco’s research yielded a startling discovery. “At that time, I was conducting a critical investigation into the benefits of sunlight,” Dr. Rocco explained. “However, due to an unannounced visit from the Red Cross, I only had six orphans at my disposal. By the grace of God, I was able to make do.” Every day at noon, Dr. Rocco would usher his adolescent test subjects into the orphanage’s dilapidated courtyard. There, he instructed them to stare directly into the center of the sun for sixty seconds.

“I performed these trials for thirty days straight,” said Dr. Rocco, continuing, “At the close of each session, I would examine the orphans’ eyes for signs of trauma.” While half of the test subjects fell victim to permanent blindness as a direct result of Dr. Rocco’s experiments, all six of them tested negative for astigmatism. “I gathered my research and immediately drove to Riga [the capital of Latvia] to present my findings to the Ministry of Health.”

On February 1, 2017, Latvia’s Ministry of Health formally adopted Dr. Kenneth Rocco’s findings and subsequently launched a nationwide initiative to educate the Latvian people on the health benefits of staring directly into the sun. For his part, Dr. Rocco has put his vital research on hold in order to better focus his efforts on spreading awareness about the sun’s benefits.

Hasashi’s vision for Angola will become a reality in just under a year when the Louisiana Department of Corrections hands over operational command of the prison to Evangelion Systems. “Once we’ve assumed control, we’ll begin the process of laying off the existing staff and bringing in the PCUs,” said Yuki Kobayashi, the lead coordinator for Evangelion Systems’ Angola Project. “PCUs are Prisoner Control Units,” Kobayashi explained, continuing, “What we’ve done is we’ve taken the L-85 Autonomous Infantry Weapon and reconfigured its battle parameters to allow it to respond to threats in a non-lethal manner.”

According to a logistics report provided to Real News Right Now by Evangelion Systems, the company intends to deploy sixty-five Prisoner Control Units; one for every one hundred inmates at Angola. “These machines are masters of efficiency,” boasted Doctor Hasashi. “A single unit has the ability to outperform humans on nearly every conceivable level.” The doctor pointed out that while prison officials are often susceptible to bribery and other forms of dishonest conduct, autonomous robots have no concept of right and wrong and are therefore impervious to corruption.

In all, Evangelion Systems plans to install no more than two hundred autonomous robotic systems at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. “The vast majority of these robots are programmed to perform maintenance tasks and other supplementary functions such as meal preparation and medical services,” explained Yuki Kobayashi. The transition is expected to take no more than two weeks to complete and could save Louisiana taxpayers an estimated $100 million in the first year alone.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/10/louisiana-penitentiary-to-become-worlds-first-prison-staffed-entirely-by-robots/,realnewsrightnow,Science,False

Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Zuckerberg: America Will Elect Its Next President via Facebook,"SAN FRANCISCO, Ca. – While speaking at the F8 developer’s conference in San Francisco this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a groundbreaking addition to the popular social media platform that many in the tech industry believe has the potential to revolutionize the American electoral process.

“We’re doing something that’s never been done before,” Zuckerberg declared. “By allowing Americans to utilize Facebook to cast their vote in the upcoming presidential election from anywhere in the world using their desktop or mobile devices, we’re eliminating the conditions for which voter suppression can be implemented.”

In the days leading up to the presidential election, Facebook users will be able to log into their accounts and find the profiles of each candidate prominently displayed at the top of their News Feed. “Users can then cast their vote by Liking their desired candidate’s profile,” Zuckerberg explained before adding, “It’s that simple.”

Kathryn Blair, a senior official with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission – the federal agency which oversees state and national elections – said that Facebook’s revolutionary new voting platform is projected to become a national standard by 2020. “We aim to completely phase out the old-style paper ballots by 2018,” Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “In a very short time, all elections in the United States will be decided through Facebook.” Ms. Blair later said the EAC is working with Facebook to reduce voter fraud by identifying and eliminating duplicate or otherwise fake accounts.

According to Zuckerberg, the upcoming U.S. presidential election is only the beginning for Facebook’s innovative voting platform. “In the not too distant future, Facebook will determine the outcome of elections all around the world. From the United Kingdom to Pakistan; to Ukraine, the Philippines and Israel,” vowed Zuckerberg. “Wherever democracy thrives, Facebook will be there.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/04/mark-zuckerberg-america-will-elect-its-next-president-via-facebook/,realnewsrightnow,Science,False

Trump took aim at Washington, D.C.’s pro sports teams on Tuesday, saying he had been expecting “a lot more recognition” when he took office on January 20, 2017.

“I will tell you it’s very disgraceful how unfairly they’ve treated me,” President Trump said during an early morning call-in to Fox & Friends, adding that at the very least he expected to be presented with a personalized jersey from at least one Washington-area sports team. “The Redskins I can understand,” Mr. Trump acknowledged, adding, “I don’t think I did very well with the Indian vote.”

The president said he considers the fact that he is not represented in the Washington Nationals Presidents Race -a promotional event held in the middle of the fourth inning during home games- to be a deliberate attack on his character. “It’s very sad –and frankly un-American– that we have sports teams in this country who are unwilling to support their Commander-in-Chief,” charged President Trump before continuing, “It’s disgusting what they’re doing – they have crippled Teddy Roosevelt running around the field and you have to wonder what they did with his blanket and wheelchair.”

The president expressed further disapproval over the Nationals’ current presidential lineup, saying, “You look at Abraham Lincoln – a terrible leader who divided this country and devastated the economy in terms of what he did to the South.” Mr. Trump said the Nationals should consider replacing Lincoln with Andrew Johnson, who served as Lincoln’s vice president and assumed office following his assassination. adding that Johnson “doesn’t get enough credit for undoing Lincoln’s failed policies.”

Trump on Monday signed The Respecting Our Flag and Military Act of 2017, an executive order requiring professional athletes in the United States to stand at attention and face the flag during the national anthem.

Effective immediately, the Act states that “by order of the President of the United States,” pro athletes are required to participate in patriotic pregame ceremonies and “shall henceforth maintain military-style posture and composure” while facing and saluting the American flag “for the entirety” of the national anthem. Further, players who fail to adhere to the law will be forced to undergo “patriotic sensitivity training” and could face up to one year in prison.

Speaking from the Oval Office on Monday, President Trump suggested that players who choose to “take a knee” during the national anthem are “uppity and ungrateful” for the opportunities afford to them as Americans. “This country has tolerated disgrace to our flag and those who fought for it for long enough,” President Trump declared moments before adding his signature to the executive order. “This disrespectful and, frankly, very anti-American behavior stops now.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, speaking to reporters during a press briefing on Monday, said the Department of Justice will send “minders” to pro sporting events throughout the United States to ensure that athletes are adhering to the terms of The Respecting Our Flag and Military Act. “They will have the power to make arrests,” said Sessions before going on to say that the Department of Justice, rather than local and state law enforcement, will have the final say in all matters related to patriotism.

On Monday, the DOJ unveiled the formation of its first ever Patriotism Task Force. Comprised of “a fine group of God-fearing Americans” with backgrounds ranging from data collection to military intelligence, Mr. Sessions said the task force will serve as the President’s “eyes and ears” throughout the continental United States. “It is our prerogative to root out and eliminate those who conspire to oppose our flag and all that it stands for,” the attorney general said.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/09/trump-issues-executive-order-requiring-athletes-stand-face-flag-anthem/,realnewsrightnow,Sports,False

“At approximately seven-thirty p.m. Thursday evening, search-and-rescue teams were dispatched to Sunset Cliffs Natural Park following reports that a number of individuals were seen throwing themselves off the bluffs,” a spokesperson for the San Diego Police Department announced during a press briefing Friday afternoon. Citing an ongoing investigation, police declined to provide further details but acknowledged that as of Friday morning, some sixty-eight bodies had been recovered near the base of the cliff.

Thirty-four year-old Juan Silvero, a four-time triathlon winner and longtime resident of Point Loma, told NBC San Diego that he alerted authorities immediately after witnessing the bizarre mass suicide. “I’d just finished a ten-mile run and I saw these people and you know, at first it wasn’t clear what they were doing, but all of a sudden they’re vaulting off the cliff like lemmings,” recalled the avid runner. “I mean, I understand that frustration when you don’t get your steps in but this was unreal.”

However, for Natalie Weathers, the tragedy is all too real. The fifty-one year-old yoga instructor believes her daughter is among the victims of Thursday’s peculiar mass suicide. “Katie left home two months ago after getting involved with some kind running club,” Mrs. Weathers told NBC San Diego. “She sold all her belongings. The only things she kept were a pair of running shorts and a Fitbit. I remember thinking how ludicrous it was but she was so adamant about it. The last thing she told me before she left was how she needed to get her steps. She said, ‘Mother, I need to get my steps, it’s all about the steps.”

As shocking as Thursday’s events may be, California is no stranger to mass suicide. On March 26, 1997, thirty-nine members of the Heaven’s Gate, a San Diego-based religious group led by Marshal Applewhite, committed suicide in an effort to facilitate entry into an alien spacecraft believed to be trailing the Hale-Bopp comet. Investigators later determined that no such spacecraft existed.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/05/mass-suicide-in-california-after-fitbit-cult-fails-to-collectively-reach-1-trillion-steps/,realnewsrightnow,Sports,False

Trump is recovering in a Florida hospital after he was struck in the forehead by a rogue golf ball at Trump International Golf Club last weekend, Breitbart News reported on Tuesday.

Hospital staff at St. Mary’s Medical Center in West Palm Beach told the Associated Press that Andrey Volesky, a sixty-eight year-old Belarusian national, was brought to the ER by Secret Service agents Sunday afternoon. “Mr. Volesky sustained a moderate head injury as a result of being struck by the ball,” a hospital employee familiar with the situation told Real News Right Now, adding that President Trump’s body double is expected to make a full recovery.

Andrey Volesky, who bears a striking resemblance to the suavely handsome and prolific actor Alec Baldwin, told The Palm Beach Post that he was approached by officials from Trump’s transition team in November of 2016. “They met with me in my home in Minsk and told me that I am to serve Mr. Trump in this manner,” Mr. Volesky told The Post, later adding that he was promised his sons would be granted U.S. citizenship as compensation for his work.

A senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press said Mr. Volesky spends the vast majority of his time working to improve his golf game in an effort to mimic the skill set of the 45th President of the United States. “Being a body double isn’t all about looks, it’s about being able to act the part,” the official said. “The President spends a great deal of time on the golf course and it is paramount that his stand-ins are able to emulate him where it counts.”

“We’ve been presented with a unique opportunity to work alongside those who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced during a press conference Friday morning. Goodell said he was recently approached by an official with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) who said Tony Romo had been selected from a pool of fifteen injured NFL players to take part in a new Exo Suit program.

Tony Romo suffered a near season-ending back injury last Thursday during a preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks. The thirty-six year-old quarterback took a hit that resulted in a compression fracture to his L1 vertebra, an injury that sources inside the Cowboys camp say could put him out for up to ten weeks. However, that could all change if Romo decides to enter DARPA’s program.

“From what I’ve been told, if he were to go through with it, it would be very beneficial,” Commissioner Goodell told reporters. While Goodell wasn’t make privy to the inner workings of DARPA’s highly classified Exo Suit program, he said that if Romo agrees to be outfitted with the prototype exoskeleton, he will find that he is able to “easily surpass the physical limits of the human body.”

For his part, Tony Romo has yet to agree to the program – at least publicly. The prospect of returning to the field sooner rather than later is, presumably, very appealing to the all-star quarterback. However, in all likelihood, Romo is weighing the negative implications of wearing a prototype exoskeleton for the rest of his life. Whatever the case, Romo will have to make a decision soon or face the possibility of sitting out for at least half the season.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/09/nfl-officials-say-exoskeleton-prototype-may-allow-romo-play-2016-season/,realnewsrightnow,Sports,False

The twenty-eight year-old biracial football star was attending a free concert with some friends Tuesday afternoon when he reportedly began to experience a stiffness in his neck. “Everyone was lounging around trying to enjoy the music,” fellow concert goer Mike Kepler told CNN. “All of a sudden the guy in front of me gets up and starts doing these stretching moves and I suddenly realize this is the guy who wouldn’t stand up for the national anthem.”

Kepler said he and his fiance repeatedly asked the NFL player to sit down but their pleas fell on deaf ears. According to a friend of Kaepernick’s who witnessed the encounter, the star athlete turned around on more than one occasion and politely told the couple that he preferred to stand after having been on an airplane all day. “It’s a free country, he tells me. Can you believe that?” Kepler later told Wolf Blitzer. “I mean who does this guy think he is?”

Kepler said he and several other attendees complained to event staff about Kaepernick’s behavior during and after the concert but were met with similar indignation. “We were basically told that it’s his right to stand if he wants to stand. Well its my goddamn right to see the f***ing stage,” Kepler retorted, adding that his grandfather died in the Pacific while fighting the Japanese to preserve that right.

“It was a piece of cake,” Phelps told ESPN’s Kevin Van Walkenburg. The senior sports writer has documented Phelps’ career for more than a decade and followed the swimmer by jet ski during the final four miles of his historic swim back to the United States. “He was graceful; it was like watching a robust swan,” Walkenburg said, adding that Phelps completed more than eighty percent of the one hundred twenty-hour journey while performing the Butterfly stroke.

Phelps, who has won a career total twenty-eight Olympic medals – twenty-three of which are gold – plunged into the waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro Saturday afternoon wearing only a Speedo, a Camelbak hydration backpack, and two waterproof tachymeters. “I always carry at least one spare,” Phelps explained, adding that on average he spends three and a half hours a day documenting his stats.

Michael Phelps said he made the noble decision to swim back to the United States rather than fly because he wanted to prove to the world – and himself – that he could. “That and I felt I deserved some me time,” the swimmer said with a laugh. Phelps described the swim as a “relaxing experience” and said he was able to maintain a steady speed of thirty-seven knots, or about forty-two miles per hour, for most of the journey.

Phelps took home five gold medals and one silver in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Twenty-nine year old Ben Hurst from Annapolis, Maryland, who participated in the marathon, said the heavily armored Abrams tank passed him shortly after crossing the Key Bridge onto M Street. “I was like ‘what the f***, that’s not fair,'” Hurst told FOX 5 DC. Hurst later said he still supports the troops.

The tank’s operator Lance Corporal Jason Connelly, who suffers from PTSD and incurs frequent blackouts and hallucinations, said the marathon reminded him of Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. “The streets were jam-packed with people,” he said. “At one point I yelled to my crewman, Todd, ‘Man the fifty!’ But then I remembered we’re in Washington, D.C.”

While cheaper than conventional ammunition, Remington’s organic line meets the same quality standards that have governed the company’s ammunition production for nearly two hundred years. “In fact, during field testing, our organic rounds outperformed almost every premium grade round on the market, including our own,” Ross said.

The components, which differenciate Remington’s organic ammunition from its standard product line, are made entirely of organically produced materials. “Even the gunpowder is organic,” Ross said. “The projectile, or bullet, is made from the pit of an avocado. Needless to say, we use organic avocados grown right here in Arkansas.” The shell casing and primer, Ross explained, are made of an ultra-lightweight organic polymer capable of withstanding extreme heat.

Gus Bryant, a retired Marine and Arkansas native, got a chance to test out Remington’s new product. Using a bolt-action Remington 700, Bryant was able to take down a deer at a distance of three hundred yards. “I found the organic rounds overexceeded my expectations,” Bryant said, adding he that he felt better about consuming the venison after using an organic bullet rather than lead.

Remington’s organic rounds are set to hit stores in later this month and are available in a variety of calibers, from .22 LR all the way up to .50 BMG.

Witnesses say Rihanna left Brooklyn Fare shortly after 11 a.m. carrying two brown paper bags – an indication that the award-winning singer is staunchly eco-minded. “The environment is something Rihanna obviously cares a great deal about,” says Mario Palmero of the New York Post. “The fact that she opted for paper over plastic demonstrates just how important this issue is to her.”

While Rihanna and Hanks come from two entirely different walks of life, the pair’s apparent love for brown paper bags could be an indication of a budding friendship. “The question on everyone’s mind right now,” says Palmero, “is, ‘Do Rihanna and Tom Hanks know each other? Are they friends? Did Rihanna see Captain Phillips? And if so, what did she think of Hanks’ portrayal of Captain Richard Phillips?”

However, Rihanna’s publicist was quick to dispute the claim, telling Real News Right Now that her client and Mr. Hanks are “nothing more” than Facebook friends. “Sure, they may exchange the occasional Poke or Like, but that in no way suggests a friendship,” Rihanna’s longtime publicist said.

Whatever the case may be, The Post’s Mario Palmero says the evidence speaks for itself. “Both Rihanna and Tom Hanks were spotted leaving Brooklyn Fare within a span of five minutes,” argues the seasoned celebrity reporter. “When you have two big-name celebrities in the same place at the same time, it’s not a coincidence,” Palmero explains before adding, “My gut tells me there’s something they aren’t telling us.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/01/rihanna-spotted-leaving-grocery-store-tom-hanks/,realnewsrightnow,Entertainment,False

“Jerry would invite us over to his flat in Central Park and almost immediately he’d retreat to the kitchen to make milkshakes,” former Seinfeld co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus revealed in an exclusive interview with The New York Post. “He would say, ‘I want you to try this strawberry milkshake. It’s a new recipe,” Louis-Dreyfus explained. “I swear to you, it was so bad that I had to excuse myself from the room.”

In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Seinfeld co-creator Larry David opened up about a similar encounter he and his former wife had with Mr. Seinfeld in the summer of 2006. “Jerry invited Laurie and I over for lunch and the next thing I know he’s in the kitchen making milkshakes,” the visibly shaken Curb Your Enthusiasm star recounted. “He comes out and he hands me this strawberry milkshake and he says, ‘Go on, try it, Larry. You’ll love it.’ It was like drinking chilled garbage. I turned to my wife and said, ‘Honey, we’re never coming here again.’ And we left. I haven’t seen Jerry since.”

A source close to Seinfeld says the iconic stand-up comedian has harbored a penchant for strawberry milkshakes since childhood and even considers himself an authority in all things ice cream. “You can’t be in a room with him for more than five minutes before he brings up his latest strawberry milkshake recipe,” the source told Real News Right Now. “It’s become a real problem for him and it makes people uncomfortable because, you know, they’ve all heard the stories.”

“I think the first question is where does he buy his strawberries? That seems to be the root of the problem,” mused Jeannie Steinman. Founder and CEO of a Los Angeles based public relations firm, Steinman said the sixty-three year-old comedian must find a way to distance himself from the steadily mounting allegations. “He’s going to have to spin this in a way that reflects positively on his character,” advised Steinman before adding, “This is going to be an uphill battle, particularly when you consider the fact that he’s been making bad milkshakes for the better part of his life. He’s conditioned to believe that this kind of behavior is okay.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/11/growing-list-accusers-say-jerry-seinfeld-makes-worst-strawberry-milkshakes/,realnewsrightnow,Entertainment,False

The twenty-six year-old Gaines, who serves as an aide to White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, said he originally intended to keep the signed roll of paper towels as a memento but changed his mind after several colleagues urged him to sell it on eBay. “I listed it as a novelty item and set a starting bid of five dollars,” Gains explained, continuing, “I honestly didn’t think anyone would even see it.”

However, much to the surprise of Gaines and his colleagues at the White House, the listing quickly ignited what would become a tense three-day bidding war between a half-dozen hopeful buyers. “We were shocked at how quickly it took off,” said Gaines. “An hour into the auction it’s already at eight dollars. Then it jumps to nine-fifty, then ten-twenty-five, eleven; it just kept going up.”

By the auction’s closing, the highly coveted two-ply roll of paper towels signed by none other than President Donald Trump himself netted Gaines a whopping $94.86. “I never expected to get anywhere close to this much,” he admitted. As to what he intends to do with his winnings, Gaines told the Post the money has already been put towards a good cause. “We’re throwing a little office soiree later in the week,” said Gaines, adding, “I used the cash to pick up a few bottles of Puerto Rican rum.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/10/roll-paper-towels-signed-president-trump-sold-95-ebay/,realnewsrightnow,Entertainment,False

The forty-one year-old Jolie has reportedly gone so far as to block all incoming text messages and phone calls from Pitt. “The question on everyone’s mind right now is whether these new developments are directly related to Brad’s bizarre decision to stop drinking two per cent milk,” said E! Online’s Avery Donahue.

One theory, according to a source close to the Jolie-Pitt family, is that Brad may have accidentally grabbed the wrong kind of milk. “He has a lot on his mid right now,” the source told Us Weekly. “He’s fighting for joint custody of his children; he doesn’t have time to worry about the type of milk he’s drinking.”

However, Eric Harris, a bagger who works at the Whole Foods where Pitt buys his groceries, says he believes the actor was buying milk for someone else. “Mr. Pitt never buys Organic Valley but this time he did,” Harris, who has bagged groceries for Pitt since 2004, told Real News Right Now. As to who the Fight Club star may have been buying the skim milk for remains a mystery.

On Monday, September 19, Jolie filed for divorce from her estranged husband, Brad Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences. The celebrity duo were married in August of 2014 after being together for nearly nine years.

UPDATE 1:04 p.m.

A source at the Beverly Hills Whole Foods has confirmed to TMZ that Brad Pitt was spotted at the upscale grocery store early Monday morning attempting to return the carton of skim milk. Pitt – who had allegedly misplaced his receipt – spoke briefly with a cashier and store manager before receiving store credit for the return, according to the source who witnessed the exchange from a neighboring cash register.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/09/shocking-development-brad-pitt-no-longer-drinking-2-milk/,realnewsrightnow,Entertainment,False

Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Ex-Stanford Swimmer to Appear on Dancing with the Stars,"XENIA, Oh. – Former Stanford University competitive swimmer Brock Turner will appear on the highly anticipated upcoming season of Dancing with the Stars, his publicist Debra Lancaster confirmed today. “Brock is absolutely ecstatic about being a part of such a diverse cast,” Lancaster told the celebrity and entertainment news website TMZ.

Fans of the competitive swimmer might be interested to learn that Turner picked up dancing while serving a brief three-month stint in a California county jail for rape. The twenty-one year-old Ohio native joined a jailhouse tap dance troupe at the urging of his cellmate and, within weeks, became the talk of the cell block. “That honky fish got moves,” Brock’s cellmate, who asked to be referred to by his street name “Pinky Stickerz,” told TMZ.

Due to the unfavorable circumstances surrounding his conviction, the terms of Turner’s probation forbid him from coming within fifteen feet of the opposite sex. “After a couple of meetings with his probation officer, we were able to negotiate that number down to four and a half feet for the purpose of the show,” explained Lancaster.

In an effort to meet the unusually strict demands set in place by Turner’s by-the-book probation officer, DWTS producers have decided to pair him with fellow competitive swimmer Ryan Lochte. A source close to the Turner family said Brock cannot wait to get his “twenty minutes of action” on the dance floor with the twelve-time Olympic medalist. “This will be a real treat for Brock,” the source told Real News Right Now.

Director Tyler Perry, whose previous films include Madea Goes to Jail and Diary of a Mad Black Woman, described himself as a die-hard fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy but said the film’s “distinct lack” of African-American actors inspired him to produce a remake. “We’ve got a great group of people working on this,” Perry told BET. “Kat Williams is playing the Joker. A lot of people said Heath Ledger made a great Joker, but I’m telling you now, wait until you see Kat.”

Also included in the all-star cast is iconic rapper turned actor Ice Cube. One of the pioneers of gangsta rap, the former member of N.W.A. has signed on to play Lieutenant Jim Gordon. In a recent interview with The Source, Ice Cube said he plans to bring a “21 Jump Street-style vibe” to the Gotham City Police Department. In addition, comedian Kevin Hart is expected to appear in a minor role as Robin, Batman’s loyal sidekick.

Actor and author Sir Michael Caine, who played Bruce Wayne’s British butler and valet throughout The Dark Knight Trilogy, will appear in Perry’s adaptation – again – as Alfred Pennyworth. “I’m just relieved I don’t have to relearn my lines,” the actor joked. A source with first-hand knowledge of the casting process confirmed to Real News Right Now that Caine is the film’s only Caucasian actor.

Trump abruptly cancelled a highly anticipated state visit to Denmark over a failed bid to purchase Greenland, Danish prime minister Mette Frederikson offered a compromise, saying the European nation is willing to sell the United States a bridge in Brooklyn for $1 billion.

“It’s a very nice bridge, in fact, some might say it’s the best bridge,” Frederikson told BBC News, adding that the overpass, often referred to as the ‘Brooklyn Bridge,’ would be a fine addition to President Trump’s home state of New York. “One of the most fascinating aspects of this particular bridge,” Prime Minister Frederikson explained, “is that a person is able to traverse the East River without the need of a boat or a fashionable pair of swim trunks.”

Denmark had initially intended to sell the bridge at an upcoming European Union auction with a starting bid of 4.5 billion Euros, but following the tragic news of President Trump’s cancelled visit, hundreds of thousands of devastated Danes took to the streets of Copenhagen in a show of solidarity with the American people. “We know how much this visit meant to the Americans,” Emil Pedersen, a twenty-nine year-old web developer from Aarhus, told Sky News. “Just knowing that Mr. Trump is out of the country –if only for a few days– must feel like an enormous weight has been lifted from the backs of every man, woman, and child in America.”

Despite the results of the 2013 World Happiness Report, which ranked Danes as the happiest people on earth, many in the Scandinavian country were brought to their knees in overwhelming anguish this week upon learning that President Trump would not grace the pristine streets of Copenhagen with his world-renowned compassion and goodwill towards mankind. “There was a strong feeling that something had to be done to remedy this – and quickly,” former Danish parliament member Rasmus Jarlov told BBC News.

Following an emergency session of Parliament on Thursday, Danish officials, in an effort to smooth things over with their staunch American allies, voted unanimously in favor of giving President Donald J. Trump the option to purchase the Brooklyn Bridge for $1 billion, a fraction of its starting bid at next year’s EU auction. “It would take a feeble-minded imbecile to look at this and not see the irrefutable benefits of this once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity,” Prime Minster Frederikson said, continuing, “This bridge is, to put it frankly, an astounding architectural achievement and a testament to the ingenuity of the human race.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/08/denmark-offers-to-sell-u-s-a-bridge-in-brooklyn/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False
738,"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Trump Says He May Tour North Korean Political Prisons to ‘See How It’s Done’,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration is working closely with North Korean officials to arrange an exclusive tour of the hermit kingdom’s notorious political prison system during an upcoming state visit to Pyongyang next year.

“They have a very good system over there,” President Trump told reporters during a brief exchange on the South Lawn on Friday. “They put the whole family in there and if you look at the situation they’ve done a tremendous job in terms of dealing with dissent.” Mr. Trump, who has made criminal-justice reform a top priority since taking office in January 2017, called the North Korean model “one of the best in the world.”

A senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press told The Washington Examiner that in a recent letter to the president, North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong-un suggested three possible prison camp locations for Mr. Trump’s highly anticipated trip to Pyongyang in 2020. “Given its close proximity to the capital, the Kaechon internment camp was the obvious choice,” the official told The Examiner.

Located approximately forty miles north of Pyongyang, Kaechon –otherwise known as Camp 14– is a sixty-square-mile forced labor camp housing some 15,000 individuals deemed “politically unreliable” by the state. Prisoners of all ages –including women and children– work from 5:30 a.m. until midnight seven days a week mining coal – a major selling point for President Trump, who campaigned on the promise of reviving the ailing U.S. coal industry. “We’ll have to look at it very carefully, but I will tell you if we end up doing something like that here it will be very good for the economy,” the president said.

One of thirteen active political prison camps in North Korea, Kaechon is often referred to as a “total control zone,” meaning those imprisoned within its walls will remain there for life. For more heinous crimes such as openly criticizing the government or illegally possessing a Bible, convicts are subjected to the “three generations of punishment” rule, a form of kin punishment whereby immediate family members of the condemned are also handed a life sentence.

Citing security concerns, President Donald J. Trump on Friday said only a handful of “vetted” journalists will be allowed to accompany him on his visit to the North Korean labor camp. “We’re definitely bringing Jim Acosta,” the president said moments before boarding Marine One, adding, “We may even leave him there, I don’t know, we’ll see what happens.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/07/trump-says-he-may-tour-north-korean-political-prisons-to-see-how-its-done/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False

Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",John Bolton: Iranian Attack on Drone ‘Potentially Worse’ Than Attack on US Troops,"JERUSALEM, Isr. – Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Jerusalem on Sunday, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton criticized President Donald J. Trump’s last-minute decision to call off an attack on Iranian missile and radar encampments, saying the president should have taken the drone’s “human value” into consideration when deciding on an appropriate response.

Citing an internal Department of Defense memorandum, Mr. Bolton said “Pentagon actuarial tables” estimate the $220 million RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone –the type allegedly shot down over Iranian airspace last Thursday– is worth approximately thirty-three American lives. “It is incomprehensible that this administration would allow an unprovoked attack on thirty-three American soldiers to go unpunished,” Bolton charged.

A copy of the internal Pentagon report obtained by The Jerusalem Post states that the “human value” of a single American soldier serving in the Middle East is approximately $6.5 million. Meanwhile, American service members deployed to Europe or Asia are valued at less than half that number, while soldiers stationed within the continental United States are valued at slightly less than $48,000. In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense told Real News Right Now that the internal memo was prepared “for insurance purposes only.”

In a rare admission on Sunday, President Trump’s national security adviser praised former president Barack Obama, saying that “at the very least” he understood the value of the drone. “Despite his many shortcomings, [President Obama] had a close, personal relationship with them. In particular, he held a deep affinity for our fleet of Predator drones,” Mr. Bolton recalled, continuing, “They shared an unbreakable bond – something President Trump has not yet developed.”

Mr. Bolton went on to compare the Iranian downing of an unmanned surveillance drone to assault on a police K-9 or horse. “A heinous attack such as this is legally considered assault on a police officer,” Bolton said, adding that U.S. service members afford the same level of respect and camaraderie toward drones as American law enforcement officers afford their service animals. “An attack on one is an attack on all,” Mr. Bolton declared amid raucous applause.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in the Persian Gulf this week, echoed Mr. Bolton’s sentiment, saying the remote operator of the downed Global Hawk surveillance drone suffered carpal tunnel in the aftermath of the Iranian missile strike. “We must not let this courageous young man’s suffering be in vain,” Secretary Pompeo told the Associated Press. The drone operator is undergoing treatment at a Veterans Affairs facility and is expected to make a full recovery.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/06/john-bolton-iranian-attack-on-drone-potentially-worse-than-attack-on-us-troops/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False
740,"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Pope Francis: God Can’t See Prayers on Facebook Unless Privacy Settings Disabled,"BUCHAREST, Ro. – Speaking before an enthusiastic congregation during his first papal trip to Romania on Sunday, Pope Francis addressed what has become a particularly hot-button issue for Christians of all denominations: prayer in the age of social media.

“God encourages us to embrace all forms of communication,” Pope Francis declared during his homily at a newly consecrated church in the Transylvanian city of Blaj. The pope likened the use of prayer through social media to “an encounter in the flesh that comes alive through the body, heart, eyes, gaze, [and] breath of the other,” and encouraged Christians to share stories of beauty and suffering in an effort to “seek out the good so that we may rediscover what unites us.”

In the case of individual prayer, Pope Francis acknowledged that God can, in fact, see prayers published on social media. However, Christian social media users must adhere to a strict set of guidelines set in place by the Catholic Church. “Capitalization and the use of proper grammar are a matter of utmost importance in the eyes of the Lord,” Pope Francis explained, adding that any mention of God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit must be capitalized in order for the post to become visible to the Lord.

Further, the pope urged Christians of all denominations to “immediately and unequivocally” disable the privacy settings on their social media accounts. Referencing Isaiah 59:3, which reads, “… your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear,” Pope Francis warned that “failure to fully disable our privacy settings creates a barrier of sin between us and the Lord.”

The pope’s remarks, which were timed to coincide with the 53rd World Day of Social Communications, come as a relief for many in the Christian faith who worry their prayers on social media often go unanswered. In closing, Pope Francis advised Catholics and Christians alike to end every social media post -prayer or otherwise- with “Amen,” saying, “All endeavors in life are prayers to our Creator.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/06/pope-francis-god-cant-see-prayers-on-facebook-unless-privacy-settings-disabled/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False
741,"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Jesus Christ Being Held at CIA Black Site in Effort to Delay Armageddon,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – A former government contractor who oversaw interrogations for the Central Intelligence Agency in the months and years following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and Washington, says Jesus Christ has been held at a CIA black site for nearly two decades as part of a secretive effort by the United States and its allies to postpone Armageddon.

The contractor, who testified in a closed-door session before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last week, said that Jesus Christ, who many believe to be the Son of God, was detained in northern Afghanistan by U.S. special forces in the spring of 2002 after having been mistaken for an al Qaeda operative. “What he was doing in Afghanistan at that point in time – we have no idea,” Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo) told The Washington Examiner. “One has to hope he was on his way to Jerusalem.”

While an estimated 2.2 billion people around the world follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, CIA interrogators were reportedly unaware that the man whom they believed to be intimately involved in planning future attacks against the United States had actually died for their sins more than two thousand years ago. “It wasn’t until late 2005 that Christ chose to reveal himself to his interrogators,” Blunt told the Examiner, adding that several current and former CIA operatives witnessed Jesus turn water into wine during an intense sixteen-hour waterboarding session.

According to testimony gathered by the Senate Intelligence Committee, CIA officers later received orders from the Bush administration to extract information from Christ regarding the location of the Battle of Armageddon and the identity of the antichrist. When modern enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding proved ineffective, the CIA began using more “antiquated methods” such as scourging and elevated spread-arm stress positions. “Being that Christ is not of this world, we have determined that he is not protected by the Geneva Conventions,” wrote then-CIA director Porter Goss in a letter to President George W. Bush.

Despite the implications surrounding Christ’s untimely return to earth, the United States has no immediate plans to release him from CIA custody. “We’re talking about one of the longest held detainees in the War on Terror,” Florida senator Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. “But the consensus – not just here in America but in most of the Western World – is that it’s just not time [for the Second Coming],” Senator Rubio said, adding, “We still have so much to do.”",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/05/whistleblower-jesus-christ-being-held-at-cia-black-site-in-effort-to-delay-armageddon/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False

Trump showered French President Emmanuel Macron with praise, calling him “tremendous” and “incredible” before affectionately referring to the forty year-old President of France as “the son” he never had.

“I will tell you, it’s not fake news that we have a very special relationship,” President Trump announced during the first of nearly two dozen unscripted and seemingly off the cuff toasts to the French leader. “He’s like a son to me, he really is. He’s the son I never had,” Trump conceded, later adding, “I should have married a French woman. I mean just look at this guy. Look how handsome he is.”

President Trump, who has fathered at least five children of his own including three boys, recounted an intimate moment in the Oval Office early Tuesday when he took it upon himself to brush some dandruff off of Macron’s shoulder. “It felt like a very fatherly thing to do – and I will tell you we usually have help that handles that sort of thing but it felt very nice,” President Trump recalled.

In a statement provided to France 24, a spokesperson for President Emmanuel Macron said the country’s youngest democratically elected leader has developed an affinity for Mr. Trump. “He shares many of the same views and values as [the U.S. president] and has come to see him as a mentor and, to some extent, an adviser in both personal and political matters,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

While President Donald Trump’s relationship with his French counterpart may very well be special and unique, it remains far from perfect. A senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke to Real News Right Now on condition of anonymity said Mr. Macron declined an invitation to sit on President Trump’s lap during Tuesday’s meeting in the Oval Office.

According to several sources who attended Wednesday’s event, angels appeared to Mr. Pence during a midnight Easter Vigil last Sunday, telling the Vice President of the United States that God will end all human suffering on July 10th, 2018. “Our prayers have been answered,” a jubilant Pence reportedly told the room before adding that he and his wife plan to “ride this thing out” in a secure bunker beneath the U.S. Naval Observatory.

Citing logistical issues and unapproved security clearances, Pence told his staff that he “couldn’t promise” they’d all have a place in the bunker. However, the vice president was quoted as saying, “You’ll all have a place in heaven if you’ve accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.”

While Pence is known to have a direct line of communication with God, those close to the vice president say his most recent vision is particularly jarring. “Usually it’s just trivial stuff like ‘don’t forget to tie your shoes’ or ‘you should run for public office,” Becky Huntsman told Real News Right Now. Huntsman, who attends a bible study group with Mr. and Mrs. Pence, said she finds it “unsettling” that God would only give humanity three months to repent. “After everything that’s happened, you know, with Moses and the Ark – I mean it’s great news; it just seems so sudden.”

Alyssa Farah, who serves as Press Secretary to the Vice President, defended Mr. Pence’s decision to not immediately inform the White House of his vision on Wednesday, saying the vice president was unsure as to whether God would want President Trump to know of the impending rapture. “This was something that the Vice President intended to pray on,” Farah told reporters, adding that Pence had not anticipated the conversation would be leaked to the press.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/04/vice-president-pence-god-to-end-human-suffering-on-july-10th-2018/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False

Trump said he has taken Vladimir Putin at his word that the Russian president did not tape a sign reading ‘kick me’ on his back during a meet and greet with world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this weekend, despite numerous statements and a plethora of photographic evidence proving otherwise.

‘He said he didn’t do it. He said he didn’t put the sign there. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as they flew from Da Nang to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Saturday. The president said he confronted Mr. Putin on three separate occasions during the summit, each time asking him about the ‘kick me’ sign. “Every time he sees me, he says, “I didn’t do that,” Trump said. “And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.”

The sign, which appeared to written in blue marker and constructed using a sheet of paper and scotch tape, hung prominently from President Trump’s blazer for most of the APEC summit and was clearly visible during the president’s thirty-minute address to Pacific Rim leaders. “It gave me quite a chuckle to see it dangling there while he was rambling on about trade abuses,” a member of China’s delegation to APEC told the Global Times. “Of course, no one wanted to be the first to kick him,” the official said, adding, “But everyone knew [Putin] put it there.”

Everyone, it seems, except Donald Trump. Citing discrepancies in statements made by Russian and American officials regarding the timing of the sign’s placement, the president remained steadfast in his belief that Putin couldn’t have been the culprit. “I mean give me a break, I can’t stand there and argue with him,” he said. “I’d rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you. I’d rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about a sign.”

“Russia has no interest in acquiring new territories outside the boundaries of Eurasia,” Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, announced during an unscheduled press conference with the international media on Friday. “There is absolutely no scenario in which the Russian Federation would benefit from an annexation of Puerto Rico – or any island in the Caribbean for that matter,” Peskov added.

Russian officials say senior members of President Donald J. Trump’s national security team reached out to them less than an hour after Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was taken into federal custody on Monday. Manafort, who faces a slew of charges including money laundering and conspiracy against the United States, is the first person to be charged in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

According to Mr. Putin’s spokesperson, the Kremlin immediately rejected the Trump administration’s initial request for more than 33,000 of Mrs. Clinton’s deleted emails in exchange for the hurricane-ravaged U.S. territory. “There was not even a moment’s hesitation,” Peskov told reporters, continuing, “An offer of this kind is no good for Russia; even a Chechen can see that.”

Nevertheless, the White House persisted. Official transcripts provided to The Guardian by Moscow show the Trump administration made two more attempts to seal the ill-fated deal with Russia. First, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took a go at diplomacy Wednesday morning by offering to invest “vast sums of money” in Russia’s tourism industry. Shortly after Kushner was rejected, President Trump contacted Putin directly and told him the United States would allow Russia to place intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Puerto Rico. “I promise you, we will look the other way,” Mr. Trump was quoted as saying.

Following Friday’s impromptu press conference at the Kremlin, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations filed a formal complaint against the United States and threatened to sever diplomatic ties unless the White House “ceases all efforts to dump its dirty laundry in Russia’s backyard.” Requests for comment by the White House Press Office were not returned.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/11/russia-no-interest-acquiring-puerto-rico-despite-pleas-white-house/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False

Trump assumed office on January 20, according to a treasure trove of declassified Canadian intelligence documents made public on Thursday.

The documents, which were obtained by the Toronto Sun through Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, show how the Canadian Security Intelligence Service – often working in conjunction with the Canada Border Services Agency – used a number of enticing incentives including the promise of free healthcare to lure an estimated three million U.S. citizens across the border.

“Our orders came directly from the Office of the Prime Minister,” a senior Canadian intelligence official with firsthand knowledge of the operation told the Toronto Sun. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, described at least a dozen instances in which “high-profile” American defectors were offered a lifetime supply of maple syrup – a right afforded only to natural-born citizens – in exchange for information pertaining to U.S. economic and national security secrets.

When it comes to convincing their neighbors in the south to defect, Canadian intelligence officials have a wide range of options at their disposal. “When you get right down to it, Americans are a simple people,” Doug McKenzie, a former Canadian counterintelligence operative, told Real News Right Now. McKenzie, who serves as an adviser to the Security Intelligence Review Committee, said the vast majority of Americans who renounced their citizenship in the weeks and months following Mr. Trump’s inauguration were persuaded with offers as simple as a signed Wayne Gretzky jersey or the opportunity to take a selfie with Justin Trudeau.

However, selfies with the prime minister and unlimited jars of fresh maple syrup aren’t the only incentives motivating Americans to embrace a more progressive way of life across the border.

North Korea’s state-run news agency, KCNA, described Friday’s test as a “glorious victory,” saying the Hananim-ui Son, which translates to “Hand of God,” is capable of “vaporizing” the U.S.-led International Space Station in a single burst. South Korean intelligence officials say the laser weapon, which is believed to be housed near a military installation along the country’s mountainous border with China, poses a grave threat to stability in the region.

In a series of tweets fired off Saturday evening, U.S. President Donald J. Trump renewed a promise he’d made in early August, saying North Korea – which has since launched two ICBMs capable of striking Guam over Japan and has conducted its sixth nuclear test – will be met with “fire and fury” if it continues to make threats against the United States. “North Korea best quit while they’re ahead,” President Trump tweeted, later adding that his administration is exploring “many” military options.

North Korea’s latest display of increasingly advanced military might has left experts around the world in a state of disbelief. “No one knew they were capable of developing technology of this magnitude,” Nicolai Rehcenko, a former Russian cosmonaut and weapons developer, told Russia Today.

748,"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']",Report: Islamic State Fighters Terrified of Transgender 'Super Soldiers',"MARAWI, Ph. – Islamic State fighters are fleeing the Philippine city of Marawi at what U.S. intelligence officials are calling “an alarming rate” after rumors that the United States is preparing to deploy a battalion of transgender ‘super soldiers’ to quash the ISIS foothold in the besieged city began to circulate on pro-jihadist websites last month.

“The mood in Marawi right now is very somber,” reported Francis Perault of VICE News. Perault, who is embedded with the Philippines special forces as they battle the Islamic State, said many militants believe American transgender soldiers are the result of a genetically modified super soldier program initiated by former U.S. president Barack Obama.

“This idea that they somehow possess the strongest qualities of both sexes is simply incorrect,” said Major General Mitchell Landry, who oversaw the Pentagon’s super soldier program under Obama. Maj. Gen. Landry, who appeared on MSNBC Tuesday night to dispel claims that transgender Americans have been forcibly recruited into the program, said candidates are selected from group homes at a very young age. “These individuals have no concept of gender identity,” Landry charged, adding, “In any case, sex is completely irrelevant to their mission.”

Nonetheless, communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence and obtained by The Washington Post show the Islamic State believes transgender super soldiers are so deadly that even President Donald Trump doesn’t want anything to do with them. “These guys are absolutely terrified,” a senior U.S. intelligence official told The Post. “Much of what we’ve been able to intercept is stuff you’d expect to see in a science fiction movie.”

The Philippine military has been fighting to liberate Marawi City from Islamic extremists since early May when heavily armed ISIS militants stormed the city, killing more than twenty-one people. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Defense unveiled plans to provide air support in the form of targeted drone strikes. Hours later, ISIS commanders issued a warning to recruits saying they should expect to encounter American transgender soldiers who posses nearly twice the strength of a normal human being.",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/08/report-islamic-state-fighters-terrified-of-facing-transgender-super-soldiers/,realnewsrightnow,International News,False

However, residents of the US are not taking this 'attack' lying down.

“This is very disturbing,” lamented WHO scientist, Jerry Alarmed. “We have never seen anything like this in the history of virology. We are looking at something unprecedented. Just imagine if this spreads - the world's IQ will go down by 60 points or more.”

“I’m warning everyone to keep an eye on your I-phones, because these duplicates won’t hesitate to pick them up and start texting with them. Whatever you do, don’t mention the word 'golf' to them.”

“The meeting between Balsonaro and I went extremely well,” stated Trump at a White House press conference. “He is such a handsome guy. He is a high-intelligence guy, really smart. His golf IQ was off the charts. I must admit, he is nearly as smart as I am. He is an expert on almost as many things that I am an expert on, and believe me, I’m an expert on everything.

Populations worldwide whole-heartedly embraced the malady known as coronavirus, incorporating it into their daily lives with everything from lockdowns and grocery store shutdowns to sporting event and travel cancellations. “COVID-19 was much more than just a passing fad,” said Han. “It became a lifestyle.”

And according to Hahn, the FDA aims to outdo itself with its follow-up pandemic. COVID-20 is expected to produce an even more massive strain on economies, social life, and global food systems than that ever achieved by COVID-19. “We’re playing around with a few different concepts at this point,” said Hahn. “One possibility is having a whole sector of the population living on peanut butter and popcorn. Throw in a nut allergy or two, and the plot basically writes itself.”

Populations worldwide whole-heartedly embraced the malady known as coronavirus, incorporating it into their daily lives with everything from lockdowns and grocery store shutdowns to sporting event and travel cancellations. “COVID-19 was much more than just a passing fad,” said Han. “It became a lifestyle.”

And according to Hahn, the FDA aims to outdo itself with its follow-up pandemic. COVID-20 is expected to produce an even more massive strain on economies, social life, and global food systems than that ever achieved by COVID-19. “We’re playing around with a few different concepts at this point,” said Hahn. “One possibility is having a whole sector of the population living on peanut butter and popcorn. Throw in a nut allergy or two, and the plot basically writes itself.”

Until the release of COVID-20, however, the FDA urges Americans to continue to make the most of COVID-19 while it is still widely available. “It's no exaggeration to say that coronavirus is already an all-time FDA classic,” said Hahn. “So if you haven't yet delved in, now's the time.”",https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/147311/fda-begins-planning-sequel-to-covid-19,thespoof,International News,False

Many shoppers are confessing that they actually enjoy the taste of horses, with many even admitting that they couldn't tell the difference between, beef, horse, goat, pork or even chicken, especially when minced and covered in sauces, spices, and cheese.

So popular has become horse meat, a new fast-food chain, Mr. Eds, has opened in several British cities, serving up tasty snacks such as foal burger, deep-fried, and beer-battered pony and, for those on a budget, donkey kebabs.

""It all tastes the same to me,"" said Tatty Mullett of Hull. ""I mean, if I hadn't have known, I would have never guessed that my frozen lasagne, burgers, and pies had horse meat in them. It tastes pretty good to me, to be perfectly honest.""

According to the MIMF report, ground beef that was infused with pomegranate juice to add a pinker, bloodier ""feel"" elevated cancer rates and heart disease among those who consumed it regularly, as compared to those who did not consume any fruit-infused meat.

""It's concerning,"" said MIMF founder and president, Joe Kelly. ""More research needs to be done, of course, but at this point we're recommending that people stick with straight meat.""

Kelly further cautioned, ""Pomegranates on their own could be relatively benign, but they're also very carb-heavy. If you're worried, we'd recommend avoiding those, too.""

When pressed as to whether it could have been the ground beef itself, rather than the added pomegranate juice, that resulted in the elevated health risks, Kelly declined to speculate, explaining that red meat has seldom been the focus of nutrition research because it is so clearly essential to muscle and bone health. He reminded Americans, too, ""Beef - it's what's for dinner.""

With regard to safer burger dressings, Kelly noted that no peer-reviewed studies have convincingly shown that adding ketchup to hamburgers increases health risks - and suggested, moreover, that that tasty condiment could provide a handy way for people to boost their vegetable intake.

The Klinikum is a state-of-the-art psychiatric hospital, specializing in delusions that cause fear and impair patients' ability “in managing reality.”

Mr. Matthews was flown directly to this facility following his comparison of the Sanders Surge with the sweep of Nazi Germany through Europe in 1940.

He was also distressed recently with the possibility journalists might be executed in Central Park, and suggested Mr. Sanders might be ordering him up for the firing squad, if winning the 2020 presidential nomination.

MSNBC's Psychiatric Department went directly into action Sunday.

Klinikum am Weissenhof responded kindly “to a fellow freedom-loving country, in its own crisis, now that we're over ours.”

Sanders is currently a “democratic socialist” with the key message that re-balancing wealth in America is badly needed.

A consequence of his emphasis, which indicates that if elected, the American Plutocracy will have to pay more taxes, has brought on a deluge of smoke-bombs, demonizing, and gleaming eyeballs.

Mr. Matthews has nothing against Sanders personally, but fears the enveloping voter surge at this time in the primaries is “encouraging another Hitler,” according to insider sources.

Mr. Sanders has replied he will not for a moment consider growing a white Charlie Chaplin mustache directly under his nose.

When called “flippant” for this remark, he further responded:

“Mr. Matthews should flip his brain around to understanding the difference between a lying megalomaniac bent on world conquest and my campaign!”

790,['Joseph K Winter'],Pacific Gas & Electric plans shutdown of power to entire state of California,"Due to the latest outbreak of fire caused by its own faulty transmission wires, PG&E has said it simply can’t afford too many more homeless bringing lawsuits against the company.

Once again, as with the recent horrific Kincaid fire in Northern California, homes and other structures have been burned, putting people into their vehicles and onto the streets.

They join others who have been living in their vehicles for the past two years, again from faulty PG&E equipment causing fires.

Any casual observer traveling the highways notices wires strung up on slender wooden poles, some leaning, some pecked through by woodpeckers.

Poles are sometimes known to burst into flames from malfunctioning high power lines strung across them.

However, there is a readily-applied answer to all this.

The power in Northern California recently was shut down for five days on two occasions.

This handy dandy answer led on to conditions approaching chaos as landlines failed in remote areas where cell phones don’t work, supermarkets had to throw away tons of food, and gas stations assumed wait-lines of two hours.

However, an even more dramatic and efficacious solution is now being considered.

With a total shutdown of power throughout California, the problem of faulty equipment and deteriorated infrastructure is ameliorated.

Having much less to do under conditions of no power, Californians can turn in massive numbers to cleaning up the environment, especially in Northern California forests.

Some investment in tools, tents, barbecues, and sleeping bags can put millions in the state to work on the problem, particularly helpful to homeless people.

Further, with concentration on this matter of basic survival similar to past centuries of darkness, candle, and kerosene lantern, Californians will have little time left for politics.

Thus, any hint of “radical, Putin-favoring sentiments” and such madness as ""emissions reduction in vehicles"" will no longer be important.

Additionally, giving infrastructure workers weapons will allow them to hunt for their own evening meals, instead of relying on scrounging through garbage cans here and there.

All in all, PG&E feels that this positive approach to fire season will certainly lessen the possibility of devastating fires and deaths from PG&E equipment.

Investors and banks can remain assured PG&E may continue in some fashion to serve them and not just the community, and the company will be in a better financial situation overall.

California residents will surely benefit by toughening up to deal with rolling blackouts, and a return to conditions of earlier centuries.",https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/us/146167/pacific-gas-electric-plans-shutdown-of-power-to-entire-state-of-california,thespoof,Politics,False

793,['Purple Girl'],Team to produce the Gagatron 8-bit computer,"Two men are creating a new 8-bit computer platform called the Gagatron. It uses TTL and CMOS logic. The goal of the project is not really to produce a computer in the spirit of open hardware, but to silence those they disagree with, and to attack free speech.

According to Michael Bergenheimer, ""We allow anyone to join our discussion forums, but they must not criticize our platform anywhere on the web, and they must not even as much as joke anywhere on the web, under any screen name, in a politically incorrect manner. We don't care how well you can wire or code, just so long as you are perfect.""

According to Willam Bradbert, the other co-founder, ""We will not associate with any white person unless they are self-hating and have no desire to defend or promote their culture. Shoving our views down the throats of others is more important than to create a good neo-vintage computer.""

Their neo-vintage computer adds one feature not present in older systems: it has a brain scanner designed to monitor the private thoughts of the user, and it applies electric shocks to the user if the thoughts are not politically correct.

Critics say that the computer's name is appropriate, but think that they are using the wrong medium to express their thoughts.

According to computer enthusiast, Keith Jones, ""They forget that the transistor was invented by a known racist. So, anyone trying to silence those trying to bring advances to the world merely because they have a private belief is a hypocrite. Had a racist not invented the transistor, they'd be building their computer out of vacuum tubes. Their own attitude is no better than those with anti-gay and anti-transsexual bigotries. We wouldn't have a lot of our computer principles if it weren't for a gay British man, nor would we have VLSI and superscalar architecture if it weren't for a transsexual woman.""

When asked if he was equating racism with sexual and gender orientations, Jones added, ""You might say that nobody is born a racist, and that might be true. However, no man is born with a penis in his mouth, or wearing a dress either.""

When Jones was asked if he had an account on the Gagatron's site, he said that he was preemptively banned, and could not start an account there. According to Jones, ""I'm willing to try their site and give them a chance, despite my preconceptions that they are fascists and self-hating racists, but they are not willing to give me a chance.""

According to the television psychologist, Dr. Frank, ""Folks such as the computer developers have a lot of internalized racism and self-hate, so they are bigoted against people they perceive as racists. For them, even a good-natured joke that makes fun of racism sets them off, and they are quick to paint them as racists. They've sublimated and redirected their racist desires by hating those they see as fascists, so when they go terribly wrong inside, they will stomp a 'racist' to death when they'd rather be stomping a member of an ethnic minority. They deliberately set up their own lives where they must attack those who are most like them in order to succeed.""",https://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/147199/team-to-produce-the-gagatron-8-bit-computer,thespoof,Science,False

796,['Michael Sienicki'],"Elon Musk Creates Time Machine, Sends Tesla Cybertruck Into The Past","When Elon Musk announced his plans to create a time machine back in April of 2016, many in the scientific community were skeptical of the entrepreneur’s ability to take on such a formidable task. Despite the reservations, many in attendance at the press conference waited curiously as he took the stage to unveil his newest project:

“Hey Guys,” he addressed the crowd, “So, you remember when I shot a Tesla into space? Well, my buddies and I were talking, and we decided we’re gonna make, like, a really badass time machine; and then we’re gonna, like, send a Tesla back in time.”

While many celebrated Musk’s ambition to be the first to bend time and space, the project known as TimeXXX, was not without its criticisms. In the weeks following the press conference, many physicists and academics came forward condemning not the seemingly impossible task of creating a time machine, but rather the CEO’s decision to send one of his Tesla Cybertrucks into the unknown frontier of time. One such group, Physicists United Sharing Science for Youth, drafted an open letter to Mr. Musk, erging him to reconsider his decision:

“We, proud members of Physicists United Sharing Science for Youth, strongly discourage Elon Musk for his choice to send a Tesla Cybertruck back in time. If such a task as creating a time machine should succeed, we plead with Mr. Musk that he considers the incredible possibilities that could be presented as a result. As such, we here at P.U.S.S.Y. ask that instead of a Tesla Cybertruck, he elects to send Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to the year 1988; where he could convince an eight-year-old Macaulay Culkin to use his adorable boyish charm to influence global climate policy, and thus, save us from an almost assured destruction. If Mr. Musk searches his heart, we believe he will know it to be true. The only logical conclusion is to send Dwayne Johnson into the past.”

In a brief statement, Mr. Musk took to Twitter to respond to the group’s criticism:

“Kiss my nuts, chode-lickers. Get your own time machine.”

The years following his announcement were quiet and shroud with mystery, until August of 2018, when the world was given their first indication of progress from TimeXXX. In the early morning hours of August 16th, Los Angeles police responded to multiple calls reporting a man on horseback alerting local residents of an approaching enemy. When officers caught up with the equestrian, the man introduced himself as Paul Revere. One of the first responding officers recalled the event to a local newspaper:

“Well, when we arrived on scene, it took a considerable amount of convincing to get the man to dismount from his horse. He was clearly distressed, and very disoriented. Kept saying irrational things like the British were gonna get us, and that the colonists needed to rise up. Really strange shit. We just figured he was on dust. I mean, it’s Los Angeles, crazy stuff like that happens all the time. So after a brief pursuit on foot, we finally got him to the ground and tased him a few times, and that took the fight right out of him.”

When police got the man back to central booking, officers were shocked to be met by Elon Musk and his team from TimeXXX. They explained that the man they had in custody was, in fact, Paul Revere; and that he had escaped from their testing facility only hours earlier.

Reports immediately began circulating, with many calling the arrest an elaborate hoax devised by Musk to either garner interest for his time travel program, or to possibly warn local residents of the impending release of the horrific and widely panned 2019 film, Cats. All doubts were squashed, however, when Musk assured reporters that Revere was the first measure of success for the TimeXXX program, and even went so far as to let the American patriot himself make a statement to the press:

“I’ve not the slightest imagining of where I am. This is most strange, indeed; but please, someone must alert the colonists! Without my warning, they will most surely be vanquished!”

Reflecting the fascination that reporters and the public alike had with Musk’s incredible achievement, one man in the crowd could only find so many words to describe the event:

“Well that’s pretty cool.”

It wasn’t but a year and a half later, in February of 2020, that Elon Musk announced TimeXXX had finally achieved their goal of sending a Tesla Cybertruck into the past, specifically 28 AD. When asked why he chose that period of time, Mr. Musk responded:

“Cause we thought it’d be funny.”

And when asked how the public would know if he really sent a Cybertruck into the past, his answer was short and to the point:

“Oh, you’ll know.”

Sure enough, not a week after his announcement, Christians worldwide began reporting the appearance of strange passages in their bibles, such as the book of Matthew, where Jesus was referenced, “rolling up in a sweet-ass ride” to pick up the “dirty dozen squad.”

TimeXXX had proved the impossible possible, and celebrations around the world followed in the days since the confirmation. The discovery inspired many to hypothesize what other fantastic achievements could be pursued given this newfound technology. Though, where there are opportunities, there are also challenges, one of which no one could have predicted. In the days following Musk’s crowning accomplishment, he announced that he would be shutting the project down, effective immediately. Understandably, the outcry from the public was swift and unyielding. When asked why he would deprive the world of such an extraordinary tool, the entrepreneur told reporters that the project was, “starting to get gay,” and that it was, “not that funny anymore.”

In a saga that was rife with drama and contention, Elon Musk has proven against all odds, that time travel is no longer a distant dream, but rather a true scientific reality; so long as someone else can get it figured out. The world will look back on the success of TimeXXX as one of the most significant achievements mankind has ever accomplished. As for Elon Musk, the horizon is forever expanding, the limits of which are only created by our inability to look beyond ourselves. Mr. Musk continues to look beyond, and has since already declared his next project:

“I dunno, maybe I’ll, like, send a Tesla into the Mariana Trench or something.”

Godspeed, Mr. Musk.

The Sun is maintaining its distance from Earth, of more than 93million miles.

The news comes as a huge relief, after some in the British team had voiced the opinion that the Sun was spinning dangerously out of control, was getting nearer and nearer to the Earth each day that went by, and was gradually raising the planet's temperature, causing global warming, and potentializing climate and environmental catastrophe in the near future.

That may still happen, but it's nothing to do with the Sun.

It's been meticulously calculated that, if the Sun were only 2 meters closer to the Earth, the temperature would be unbearably hot; if it were 2 meters farther away, it would be cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.

Derp points to a 1941 video of Hitler at a Nuremberg rally, where he attacks his former rival Von Hindenberg. ""Where are the telegraphs?"" he shrieked to a hysterical crowd. ""Lock him up!"" the crowd chanted back. Von Hindenberg had died in 1934, but Hitler locked up his bones anyway.

""In that video,"" said Derp, ""Hitler waves his right arm in the air, and it doesn't move like a human arm. It bends in peculiar ways, like a tentacle.""

The pocket-sized Thunberg, 16, rose to prominence when she upbraided her parents for throwing away too much food after meals, calling them the Swedish equivalent of ""wasteful"", and insisting upon having the leftovers re-hashed as 'something else' at the very next meal.

Stony-faced Thunberg then decided that the future of Planet Earth needed her more than she needed her education, and promptly dropped school from her routine until the more important business of the conditions suitable for Man's existence had been secured.

All this extremely hard work and sacrifice has been noted by several loosely-scientific organizations, and, earlier today, came the news that she has been nominated for the following awards.

• The New York Science Museum has put her name forward in their ""Seriousest Scientist"" program.

• The Stockholm branch of Science and Defiance has confirmed that she is amongst those up for a prize in this year's ""Most Intense and Piercing Stare"" competition. John Lydon was a previous winner.

• Her school has said she is a frontrunner for the ""Absentee of the Year"" award.

807,,Mexico Agrees To Pay For The Wall Only If The US “Returning Texas To Mexico”,"U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a friendly phone call with Mexico’s president on Friday but asserted he will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of the countries’ ties because Mexico has “beat us to a pulp” in the past. Mexico’s peso extended gains on news of the call. The two men spoke for about an hour on Friday, a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned meeting in Washington next week over Trump’s insistence that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar border wall. “It was a very, very friendly call,” Trump told a joint news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May.

Similarly, President Nieto conveyed a similar message in his interview with El Universal, the largest news agency in Mexico City. “I can tell you I am happy with what was said and what was agreed upon,” the president revealed. “I am convinced that we can have a friendly, respectful relationship with the United States as well as with President Trump.” Asked to elaborate on the topics mentioned during the hour-long telephone call, President Nieto said that he was not at liberty to disclose that, but did mention there was talk about the wall between the two countries, as well as a possible “deal” that might be struck in the future.

“I was very blunt and open with him, since I don’t believe him to be a man who cares much about pleasantries or protocol,” the Mexican president said. “I told him Mexico would agree to pay for the wall only under the condition that our country and the Mexican people be compensated for it in some other way. While we were talking, the though came to me that perhaps I could ask him to have his engineers design the wall so that it puts Texas in Mexican territory; in other words, to build the wall so that it excludes Texas from the United States. I though that would be fair, since we would be paying for the construction.”

He added, “I could tell he didn’t like the idea, but to be fair – he did say he would think about it. And if you think about it rationally, you’ll arrive at the conclusion that it’s a somewhat fair trade-off. Sure, on one hand our national budget would be nearly depleted, since the initial cost of construction is still only based on loose estimates. However, getting Texas back after all this time would be a huge victory for Mexico.”

“I have to add that I still haven’t figured out what we would do with the conservative, inbred rednecks that reside there at the moment, but I’m sure we’d be able to come to some sort of an arrangement. At the end of the day, we all know how huge a fan Donald Trump is of deporting people. Maybe he deserves a chance to have his campaign-long wish come true in the form of organizing the deportation of Texans to other U.S. states so that we can finally have our land back as empty and unspoiled as we left it,” Nieto concluded.",http://now8news.com/mexico-agrees-to-pay-for-the-wall-only-if-the-us-returning-texas-to-mexico/,now8news,Politics,False

The vicious lyrics fledged an attack on Eminem’s pesky mother, Debbie Mathers, who reportedly forced Eminem to skip the big school dance because he hadn’t completed this chore. While the verses in the song heavily criticize Debbie’s vigilance, Eminem ultimately promises that he will clean out his closet that very night. 17 years later, new reports suggest that Eminem’s closet has still not been cleaned out.



We visited Eminem’s dilapidated childhood home in Detroit to see for ourselves, and the scene was nothing short of disastrous. Among the clutter were buckets filled with toy soldiers, a pack of Zig-Zag rolling papers, and a pile of fan mail from someone named Stan. There were even some skeletons hanging in the back of the closet – the plastic, spooky kind from Party City.

Debbie Marshall said she found even darker items yet, “I was digging through one day and I pricked myself on a pile of nails – they must’ve been 9 or 10 inches long! And there were all these colored pills scattered around. Blue and yellow and, um, orange I think. I don’t know what they were for, but they certainly weren’t baby Aspirins.”

When asked about why he never cleaned out his closet, Eminem held firm on his decision: “Well, tempers were flarin’ from parents, but I just blew ‘em off and kept goin’. I’m not takin’ nothing from no one and I’ll give ‘em hell long as I’m breathing.

According to the Richmond Police Department, 34-year-old Raquel Hernandez decided to leave her kids in the car while treating herself to an all-you-can-eat meal at the Golden Corral Buffet & Grill.

The 400-lbs woman arrived around 11 AM and was still eating when the police arrived on the site at 8:20 PM.

“I saw them in the car when I arrived around 11:30 in the morning, I thought their mother was gone for a quick visit at the nearby pharmacy or something. But when I finished my shift eight hours later, they were still there!”

Ms. Ferguson called the police, who immediately freed the children from the vehicle and went looking for the mother.

The young waitress says she was shocked to find out that the mother of the children was a customer she had served during her entire shift.

Grandson of one the most famous horse thief in American history, Henry William Borne was arrested by the Texas Rangers in 1919 for being part of in an important horse-stealing ring.

Borne, his father and seven other accomplices were accused of stealing over 7,000 horses and mules, including a lot of 1,735 horses destined to the American military effort in the first World War.

The eight others were sentenced to death and hanged in 1920, while Borne, who was underage when the crimes were committed, was sentenced to 99 years in prison.

Unexpectedly, the Amarillo native actually survived his sentence, which was spent in a total of 11 different detention centers.

He was liberated this morning from the Central Unit Prison, in Sugar Land, after spending almost an entire century behind bars.

Visibly emotional, Mr. Borne expressed his worries about adapting to life in the 21st Century.

“I saw a few cars once as a kid when I went to Dallas. I’ve been watching TV and I know they’re now everywhere, but I’ll have to get used to it.”

Despite his long incarceration, the 117-year old man also fears he could have difficulty adapting to a life without crime.

“All I’ve ever been outside prison is a horse thief. That’s the only thing I was good at. I bet I’d still be better than most of today’s horse thieves, even at my age.”

Despite his fears, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice considers there is a “very low risk” that he will resume his life of crime.

In fact, the number of horse theft has constantly dropped over the last century and the use of identification microchips over recent years has made such crimes much easier to solve.

Punishment for horse theft can still be severe, as one woman in Arkansas was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the 2011 theft of five horses.",https://www.huzlers.com/man-freed-after-outliving-99-year-prison-sentence-for-horse-theft/,huzlers,Entertainment,False

According to investigators, the 124 residents of the Retirement Village were forced to fight each other in order to obtain basic things such as food and medical treatments.

The fights were filmed and relayed online on a specialized website, where they often attracted several thousand viewers and astounding amounts of money in bets.

FBI spokesman, Bill Donovan, says the most popular fights were the ones in which contenders were “armed” with canes or walkers.

“The older and more handicapped the fighters were, the larger was the crowd the fight attracted. Some were so weak they used mobility scooters to try and roll on each other.”

Officer Donovan says the staff used several different methods to force the residents to fight, either by through rewards or punishment.

“The nursing home’s staff forced the elders to beat each other up very badly, offering ridiculous rewards such as Jell-O or extra mashed potatoes. Some residents who refused to fight had their dentures or glasses confiscated until they complied.”

According to the FBI, the organizers of this illegal combat ring may have pocketed over $125 million over the 3 years it was in operation, mostly from online bets.

The FBI confirmed it has seized a lot of computer hardware in the Retirement Village as well as several other pieces of evidence like video cameras blood-covered walkers.

The two owners of the retirement home and five other employees were arrested for the role they played in the organization.

The five employees each face numerous criminal charges and could face sentences going from 45 to 85 years in jail if found guilty on all charges.

The owners of the retirement home, Terence and Michelle Aniston, respectively face 37 and 31 accusations and could face over 300 years in prison.

Their trial is expected to begin at the end of June and should draw a lot of media attention.

U.S.—In a tragic turn of events, America has announced that it has tested positive for socialism.

Many began to suspect America had become infected when the government announced totalitarian lockdowns and a plan to print free money for everyone, and the test results confirmed the worst: most of America is pretty OK with socialism. Healthy countries have developed strong immune systems against socialism and recoil in horror at the thought of living off the government. But when countries' immune systems begin to be compromised, they start to be apathetic toward socialism and eventually embrace it wholeheartedly.

The disease is thought to be terminal. The only known cure is to cut off the states that have embraced it, but experts believe too much of the country has now been infected for surgery to be a viable solution.

It's going to take a lot more than a deadly pandemic to stop these party animals from getting wet and wild in their natural habitat. While Spring breakers on the Florida coast are dying of the spreading COVID-19 virus, one thing lives on: their right to party. Recent aerial photographs reveal that the recently deceased funsters have been arranged on the beach to spell #YOLO — a popular acronym that stands for the inspirational axiom ""You Only Live Once"".

""I will literally party until I bleed out of every orifice and pass on enough viral death fog to wipe out a small country,"" said one man wearing one of those hats with two beer cans on top that have little hoses leading to his face. The beer-headed man's attitude seemed to match many on the beach who expressed no concern for their own deaths or the many deaths to come because of large public gatherings such as this one.

Partyers on the beach already have a drinking game planned for if police invade and force them all to disperse. ""Every time they say hands up, take a shot of tequila,"" said one of the beach-anarchist ringleaders. "" We're gonna get so trashed.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—In real news that totally actually happened, President Trump has announced that in the interest of public safety, the 2020 presidential election has been canceled.

“It’s just too risky,” President Trump told the press while standing behind a sneeze guard. “We’ll get all these people gathered together at rallies or lined up to vote, and they’re all going to get sick. And Bernie and Biden -- they’re just so old. Sending them around crowds campaiging is basically trying to murder them. Anyway, it just seems pointless for a bunch of people to die when everyone knows I was going to win anyway.”

Trump has been a divisive figure in the past, but so far everyone has agreed with this move. The New York Times, which usually opposes absolutely everything Trump does, wrote an editorial in support of canceling the election. “It’s a smart, science-driven move,” the editorial said. “As important as democracy is, it’s just not worth dying over.”

Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders also seemed very relieved by the announcement, as they’re both very tired and worried about getting sick. Sanders was especially happy, telling the press, “You know, for a few moments there, it really seemed like I might win, and I didn’t know what was going to happen if people actually expected me to follow through on all that free stuff.” Sanders is now deciding in which of his three houses to self-quarantine.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Congresspeople from both sides of the aisle assured the nation Friday they're going to try to take advantage of the current crisis in every possible way.

Americans were worried that this crisis was going to hit hard without any push from the government to present itself as the answer to all their problems. But lawmakers reassured Americans that they're working together to look at all the challenges of our current disaster and pull all the right strings so that they come out on top.

""Rest assured, America, we're working day and night to see how we can expand our unconstitutional powers, reduce individual liberty, and personally profit from this crisis,"" said one Republican senator. ""If there's a liberty somewhere we haven't tried to stamp out, don't worry -- we have good people working on it.""

""If there's a constitutional right to be trampled on in this -- we're on it,"" said one Democratic congresswoman. ""All our best people are looking into all the ways we can exploit this crisis for our own gain. We have committees working long hours to see what kind of terrible bills we can slip through while the nation is distracted.

Species 10027, Tulsi Gabbard, was successfully injected with nanoprobes and assimilated into the Borg's campaign, according to Biden's statement. Gabbard quickly lost all principles and independent thought and began tirelessly working to further the purposes of the mysterious Borg species, sources inside the Borg Cube indicated.

In a speech Wednesday, President Xi Jinpig expressed his bewilderment that the American media will simply repeat his talking points and won't even charge him a dime.

""You mean we don't even have to pay for this kind of positive press coverage? Amazing!"" said President Xi Jinpig.

Then, China politely requested that everyone stop calling the virus that definitely came from China the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus,"" and the American media ran with it. President Xi suggested that journalists refer to the virus as the ""Most Likely American Virus"" or the ""Precious Gift From Our Dear Friends In China"" or even the ""Trumpsfault Virus,"" and sure enough, several American press outlets were all over it.

Being a well-known communist, Sanders criticized the free market for having so much prosperity and toilet paper that people could run out and purchase hundreds of rolls they don't even need on a whim. ""1% of the people now own 99% of the toilet paper. Under a socialist system, each person would get an equal amount, which would probably be two or three squares.

U.S.—CNN's ratings have somehow tanked even worse than they previously had as Americans began to quarantine themselves and stopped taking commercial flights, emptying American airports and robbing the cable channel of its captive audience.

While CNN is usually able to claim millions of captive viewers every day, their audience dropped to almost nothing overnight. With airports completely devoid of weary travelers with dead smartphones and nothing to look at but CNN, the core of the channel's audience has disappeared overnight.

Screens at airports across the country continued to play CNN to empty airports, creating a spooky, dystopian atmosphere as hosts ranted to no one in particular.

On-air personalities were quick to blame the ratings dive on President Donald Trump, suggesting that he had a hand in creating the virus specifically so that CNN would implode.

""This is clearly a Trump and Fox News plot to destroy us,"" said Brian Stelter. ""The anti-science, racist Trump administration wants you to believe this started in China, but it was clearly created in a U.S. government lab to stop the extremely popular CNN!""

Overcome with rage, Stelter then transformed into his alternate personality, a raging, hulking, green monster who breaks things and rants against Trump and Fox News all the time, which is indistinguishable from his other ego except he's green and looks a little less like George Costanza.

U.S.—Joe Biden is now cruising to victory, and many are crediting his triumph to the dynamic, powerful way in which he continues not to be Bernie Sanders.

“If there’s one thing you can say about Biden, it’s that he’s not Bernie Sanders,” said Democratic voter Daryl Franklin. “I mean, he combs his hair. He doesn't go around saying, ‘I’m a socialist!’ He’s great. I don’t know what else anyone could want.”

Another voter, Robert Murray, agreed. “I mean, you look at the one candidate, and that guy is Bernie Sanders,” Murray said. “But you look at Joe Biden, and he’s someone else entirely. That’s exactly what I wanted in a candidate.”

Another factor Murray cited was the lack of annoying, angry online people obsessed with Biden, since no one is obsessed with Biden or has very strong thoughts about him one way or the other.

Biden may have some competition, though, as a very late candidate has entered the Democratic primary, a 78-year-old with a very large mustache named Sernie Banders.

Life Alert, which is sponsoring the debate, is supplying the podiums free of charge.

The candidates, who are old and may collapse to the ground at any moment, will be able to press the button should they suddenly have a heart attack or just have no idea where they are. Aides will then be able to come up and either stand them back up and hold them upright for the duration of the debate or tell them, ""Hey, Joe, the year is 2020 and you're running for president. Joe! Speak to me Joe! JOOOOE!!!""

""Also, who is the current president and who are all these little Oompa Loompas dancing around me in this mushroom forest? Flibberdoodle!""

Later on during the test run, Biden brought up Sanders's three houses in a rare moment of lucidity, and a panicked Sanders smacked the button rather than actually address the fact that he's a very rich socialist.

U.S.—One of the dreams of every conservative is owning libs, but a new report says that this dream has become unobtainable for many. That’s because of the vast inequality in lib ownership where an elite top 1% of conservatives own 50% of all libs.

According to a report from the Center for Conservative Studies, the bottom 50% of conservatives hardly own any libs at all while those at the top hog all the lib ownership, dunking on them left and right. “The average conservative has barely even tasted liberal tears,” said Dr. Edmund Martin, who conducted the study, “while someone like Ben Shapiro has a whole tumbler full of tears.”

According to Martin, most conservatives post a meme or two on social media in the hopes of owning perhaps one lib a week -- and those are usually randos with ten followers. This is while people like Steven Crowder are owning whole swaths of libs each and every day. And the inequality grows as one goes even farther to the top, as estimates show that President Donald Trump owns a full 20% of libs all by himself.

Trump was unapologetic about this. “We’re all better off when I own libs,” Trump said. “I mean, do you want libs walking around unowned? Horrible.

The poll found that after all the younger, relatively healthy people dropped out of the race, national optimism nearly tripled as people realized that our nation wouldn't be ruined by old people.

U.S.— In the wake of several primary and caucus wins, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been spotted at various campaign stops testing out different mustache styles in preparation for his inevitable reign as the next great totalitarian dictator.

""All the great dictators have a very distinctive mustache,"" Kyle Jurek, a campaign staffer for Bernie stated after a short rant about re-education centers. ""The despots without great facial hair, you can't even picture them. They're forgotten. If Bernie is meant to go down in history and be remembered among all of history's most iconic tyrannical overlords, he needs some solid, original whiskers.""

While many believe Bernie's ""I comb my hair every morning with a balloon"" hairstyle is signature enough, Sanders says he is trying out mustaches. ""We'll throw a bunch at the wall, see if any stick,"" he told his stylist.

At one campaign stop, Bernie addressed the crowd sporting a Yosemite Sam style mustache. The very next day, he was seen at a different stop with what some supporters described as more of a Stalinesque mouth brow. Later that same day, he had hard words for billionaire Mike Bloomberg which came out of a mouth crowned by a thin pencil crumb catcher. He has also been spotted recently with a Fu Manchu, a horseshoe, and the classic handlebar.

Several campaign staffers wondered out loud if he was actually growing this facial hair, which would be impressive considering the frequent changes in style from stop to stop, or merely playing with costume facial hair and adhesives in the back of the campaign bus.

Later polling revealed Bernie's instincts were solid, as over 95% of Americans said that if they were to be ruled over by an iron-fisted totalitarian despot, they would hope that despot would have an original and memorable mustache style so that their plight would not be forgotten in years to come.",https://babylonbee.com/news/sanders-tests-out-new-mustache-styles-in-preparation-to-become-next-icon-of-totalitarianism,babylonbee,Politics,False

This decision was met with resistance from Biden’s most loyal staff members. Joel Hoffman, who is rumored to have resigned in protest, was heard on the recording pushing back against this decision. “You can’t!” he is heard pleading. “That goes against everything we stand for!”

“This is the real world, kid!” Biden responded. “If malarkey is what’s going to win it for us, then that’s what we have to do. Just look at Bernie Sanders.

“We are opposed to some aspects of the Berlin Wall, but, you know, it’s simply unfair to say everything was bad,” Sanders said before a screaming throng of Bernie bros. “Barbed wire and machine guns? Maybe not so good. But it was a beautiful wall made of smooth concrete that was quite lovely. Most importantly, it kept out fascists. That’s a GOOD thing.”



At the announcement, the crowd threw their soy lattes in the air and erupted in a rapturous chant of ""Построить эту стену!"" which is roughly translated as “build that wall!” Sanders looked out on a sea of hope-filled faces, giddy over the prospect of restoring the majestic landmark built by the German Democratic Republic.



The cheering intensified as Bernie promised that not only will he build the wall, but that he will make Trump voters pay for it. Sanders also outlined plans to build walls around any American state that doesn’t support the glorious socialist revolution.

""We must be anchored in strong character if we are to stay true to our principles. These should act as guidelines for the kind of person every Democrat should want to become.""

The list was accompanied by a short description of each virtue and why it is important to the Democrats:

Envy: Being jealous is what being a leftist is all about. If everyone else has more than you, how can you possibly be happy?

Greed: Rich people are bad because they are greedy, so you should be greedy in return and try to take all their money.

Pride: Being proud of your sin is a virtue. Flaunt it, baby!

Lust: Do whatever! Woooooo!!!

Outrage: Being full of wrath and anger all the time is a great character quality. GRRR!!!

Sloth: Let other people do all the work for you. That's just being smart.

Gluten-free gluttony: Eat as much as you want as long as it's gluten-free, organic, and non-GMO.

“The implication is that somehow him having a top hat and a monocle and him carrying around sacks with dollar signs on them while yelling, ‘Get away from me, poors!’ is inconsistent with him being a socialist,” said Sanders supporter Neil Bishop, “but it’s not. The fact is, you can buy a top hat, monocle, and canvas sacks for just a few hundred dollars. It doesn’t mean anything.”

Sanders campaign worker Harry Simon agreed. “Just because he’s a socialist doesn’t mean he can’t wear a tall hat or walk around with gobs of cash in bags,” Simon explained. “Also, for someone of his age at his salary, it’s not uncommon to own a number of hats and maybe a monocle.

""It's long past time a great injustice was corrected,"" Trump told the gathered press. ""The only thing the Hamburglar is guilty of is loving hamburgers. And occasionally taking them.""

The Hamburglar had been sentenced to nine years for the theft of thousands of hamburgers. He was arrested as part of a ""tough on hamburger theft"" movement, and many felt the Hamburglar got an overly harsh sentence due to profiling since he wore a black and white prisoners outfit, a mask, and his name is a portmanteau of ""hamburger"" and ""burglar.""

""Free the Hamburglar!"" Trump used to chant at campaign rallies, ""And put Hillary in his place!"" (Trump later found out he could not ""reverse-pardon"" Hillary, though).

The move to pardon the Hamburglar was not supported by everyone. Thousands of Justice Department officials have decried the move, calling for Trump's resignation. Also, Mayor McCheese wrote a long letter against the pardon, though most of it seemed to be an ad for McDonald's new Bacon Smokehouse Burger.

WASHINGTON, DC—With new staff being added to his flourishing campaign every week, Joe Biden's advisory staff has devised a new guideline for women on the team: wearing backward wigs.

Campaign advisor Shelly Turlock explained, ""While Joe is known for his 'come up behind you and affectionately smell your hair,' signature greeting, those videos keep showing up online and turning into video-montages. We've tried to tell him to stop, he just won't. We also tried telling staff to turn and back away as soon as they felt him close, but he was just too sneaky."" Turlock says they even tried putting mirrors all over the campaign offices so that everyone had a complete 360 awareness of their surroundings at all times. ""He still managed to sneak a sniff. He's very good,"" Turlock said.

Turlock says the new backward wig policy has worked very well in keeping Biden from sneaking up on women. ""They see him coming a mile away,"" Turlock said. ""Sometimes they see him tip-toeing around behind office plants or hiding behind a rolling office chair. We all get a real kick out of it. As soon as he goes in for the sniff they say, 'Hi Joe.'""

While the policy has helped stop Joe from stealth hair-inhaling attacks, members of his team have noticed he has grown quicker and more aggressive. ""We think the wigs are having an unforeseen effect. Everywhere Joe looks there is a luscious head of hair for him to sniff, yet he is stopped every time he is about to get a whiff.

BURLINGTON, VT—Bernie Sanders has been fired from the Bernie Sanders campaign for refusing to work even a few hours a week.

The campaign released a statement Monday confirming that Bernie Sanders has been let go.

""I'm sorry, Bernie, but we're gonna have to let you go,"" said assistant campaign manager Mark Carl. ""You lounge around all day just ranting about the bourgeoisie and the need for a revolution. But you only put in a few hours and just complain a lot, expecting other people to do all the hard labor.""

Sanders slammed the campaign's decision: ""Nobody has the desire and drive to seize the means of production that I do. I mean, I wouldn't personally be the one doing the seizing. I'd hire people for that. But still.""

This isn't the first time Sanders was asked to leave an organization, such as the time he was kicked out of a commune for being lazy or the time he lost his job at a Vermont grocery store for making people stand in line for bread, just for fun. Sanders was reportedly angered by the grocery store's decision and vowed never again to work a job in his life, a vow he's kept religiously.",https://babylonbee.com/news/bernie-sanders-fired-from-sanders-campaign-for-refusing-to-work,babylonbee,Politics,False

U.S.—The campaign trail is reportedly taking a toll on Bernie Sanders. The main thing that seems to be wearing him out is the extremely foreign concept of having to convince people to voluntarily hand over money.

“This just feels so wrong,” Sanders told staffers. “If you know you really have a good idea how to spend that money, you just take that money from people under threat of imprisonment. Having to convince people to voluntarily hand over money just feels too much like capitalism.”

Initially, to get people to give him money, Sanders would just grab people by the collar and shake them, yelling, “Give me your money!” When this didn’t work, Sanders had to change his tactics to a kinder, more sensitive approach, asking for donations. “The incentive of money made me change my behavior from what I wanted to do to what other people want,” Sanders said. “I feel so dirty!”

Bloomberg waited in a Sanders campaign office ahead of the socialist's next rally and leaped out as soon as Sanders walked in, handing over a briefcase full of cash before Sanders knew what was happening. As soon as the money was handed over, the time-space paradox of Bernie Sanders now being a billionaire caused him to explode.

NEW HAMPSHIRE—After an astounding victory against Democratic rivals in the New Hampshire primaries, Bernie Sanders expressed his thanks to an adoring crowd of Bolsheviks and college students. Also present was a contingent of lying dog-faced pony soldiers, who flipped their support to Bernie after Biden’s recent gaffe.

“I happen to believe,” Senator Sanders began, “that the re-education of racists and freedom lovers from the middle of the country will be essential to healing and remaking this nation. That is why I am pleased to announce that we will build our very first re-education facility right here in the great state of New Hampshire.”

Wild cheers broke out from the crowd as Bernie supporters were moved by this great honor.

Sanders promised that this brand new camp will be tuition-free, and will provide unlimited government cheese, flour, and abortions to both men and women.

Bernie Sanders Campaign staffers were quick to inform him that such a facility may be redundant since the famous Dartmouth College Re-Education Camp already exists in New Hampshire. “That’s no problem,” said Bernie. “Just throw up some barbed wire around Dartmouth, build a train track for the cattle cars, and we’re done!”

“I had so much anger inside me because of The Last Jedi,” said Hunter, his voice shaking. “I don’t even understand what he was trying to do with it. Did he just hate Star Wars fans? But if the Bible teaches us one thing, it’s forgiveness. And I just thought back to how I liked Looper and found Brick pretty interesting, so maybe it was time to forgive trespasses and watch his widely acclaimed new movie.”

Hunter rented the movie digitally through Amazon and said he felt a certain peace now, moving past the wrong against him that was Rian Johnson’s venture into Star Wars. “It’s as Jesus said,” he added. “We’re supposed to forgive seventy times seven times, and Star Wars has only been ruined twice -- and only once by Rian Johnson. Also, the anger just isn’t healthy. Jesus also said, ‘Anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering.’” Hunter thought for a moment. “Or maybe that wasn’t Jesus, but he is pretty anti-hate.”

UK—Have you ever tried to imagine living in a perfect world ruled by communism, but previously only received the information from catchy folk songs which praise the system? Well, lucky for you, it is now easier than ever to understand what a full-blown communist utopia actually looks like.

That's because John Lennon's commie classic ""Imagine"" has been rereleased with more realistic lyrics to reflect the harsh realities of communism. Lennon, long dead---though not by way of communism, since he was blessed to live in a capitalist country---would be proud of the change, due to its artistic value in realism.

While the classic folk song does do a fantastic job of laying out the basics of communism---no religion, no possessions, no food---it never invites the listener to imagine all the people in their true form, which is dead---usually by firing squad, but often by way of starvation as well.

""John Lennon wrote this once-beautiful song way back in the seventies,"" a communist music snob told us. ""However, in the years since, we have found out that what communism actually was, was basically a non-stop killing machine. It was beautiful, really. May have saved the planet. So that's why they changed the lyrics. To make it more realistic.""

So now, with the updated lyrics, we can collectively ""imagine all the people, sharing all the world,"" dead. And what better way to share the world than in a mass grave?

The full lyrics are reproduced below.

Imagine there's no bread

It's easy if you try

No tacos or hot sauce,

Nothing cold or fried,

Imagine all the people living in the gulags

Imagine there's no money

It isn't hard to do

Nothing to eat or drink

And no bacon too

Imagine all the people living short life spans ooooh

You may say I'm a commie

But I'm not the only one

And someday you will join us

Or we'll shoot you in the face

Imagine no possessions

Because all your stuff was redistributed

Lots of greed and hunger

But seriously please can I have a potato

Imagine all the people sharing all your stuff, yeah

But I'm not the only one

“I’ve got some great ideas for your kid there,” says an eager Rian Johnson as he approaches the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda on a backwater planet. “What if we find out he does have a name, and it’s ‘Glorp’? And what if we find out he’s been able to talk all this time, but he sounds like a surly cab driver? That will blow people away.”

The terse Mandalorian responds with, “No,” “That’s a horrible idea,” and “I’ll think about it” to all of the ideas while trying to lose Rian Johnson, who then attempts to steer the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda to a casino planet where he should have “lots of fun adventures.”

Eventually, an increasingly deranged Johnson corners the Mandalorian and suggests that maybe in one episode Baby Yoda could just be suddenly killed off with no resolution to who he was, since “the show isn’t really about Baby Yoda.” He also suggests giving the Mandalorian a plucky sidekick who could give a speech about how “bounty hunting is really about love.”

Clinton, who has yet to display any symptoms of the coronavirus, was identified by Trump’s administration who believes his 2016 presidential rival is the cause of the worldwide virus that has killed thousands so far.

“You can tell she started all this. Just look at her. She looks infected doesn’t she?” Trump declared. “You see? This is why I wanted her locked up. She’s a health risk to not just this country but the entire world.”

A special White House task force, fronted by Vice President Pence made the discovery after analysing DNA samples of both the Coronavirus and Ms. Clinton and finding what they claim is a “99% DNA match” between the two.

“The evidence is undeniable,” Pence told the assembled media. “Ms. Clinton and the Coronavirus are one in the same. Clinton will now be placed in quarantine until 2021 along with any Democratic canditates she has been in contact with, Pence added.

When asked by a reporter how they could be so sure Clinton started the Coronavirus, Trump interrupted. “Listen, no one knows more about the Coronavirus than me… except possibly Hillary or ‘Killary’ as I will now be calling her.”

Furthermore in a move that is sure to please makers of Corona beer, Trump proposed renaming the deadly virus after Hillary in future. “The Clintonvirus has such a nice ring to it, don’t you think?” he grinned.

888,,Boris Johnson Elected UK’s Final Prime Minister,"LONDON, UK—The United Kingdom has overwhelmingly voted to elect Boris Johnson as the nation’s final Prime Minister.

In Scotland the independence-supporting SNP were elected at a landslide, while in Northern Ireland the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party gained more seats than the unionist party for the first time. Both are seen as key indicators of a UK break-up in the near future.

Johnson is expected to pull England, Wales and against their will, Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the EU on Jan 31st, thereby setting in motion the wheels of Scottish independence and Irish reunification

“I am honoured to have been chosen as this nation’s last head of state before we inevitably go our separate ways. I shall continue to run this country into the ground until we are nothing but a pile of smouldering rubble,” he proclaimed from load cheers from his fans.

Johnson is widely credited with leading the recent demise of the United Kingdom and the electorate clearly feels he is the perfect man to get the job done and finish the UK off once and for all.

“The UK is like a dog you’ve just run over with your bicycle. You’ve tried running over it again a few times to finish it off but nothing can quite kill it. That’s why the UK has elected me. I turn up with a bazooka and I will get it done no matter what happens, whether Scotland and Northern Ireland like it or not.”

“What about Wales?” one reporter queried to which Johnson responded: “Oh I can assure you our marine life will be fine.”

889,,Trump Tweets Trudeau: “Stop Wasting So Much Time On Facebook.”,"WASHINGTON, DC—Following Justin Trudeau’s thinly veiled condemnation of Donald Trump’s new muslim ban on social media, the U.S. President has hit back, tweeting at Trudeau to “stop wasting so much time on Facebook”.

“I mean don’t you have a country to run or something?” Trump asked, labelling the Canadian Prime Minister a “social media whore”.

“He’s constantly online, 24/7. He’s obsessed,” Trump continued, suggesting the PM should seek psychiatric help for his addiction.

The 45th American President claims Trudeau’s “embarrassing” attempts to “get likes” is all the more pathetic given he has so few followers compared to Trump:

“As of 3am last night, Trudeau only had 3,735,257 followers on Facebook compared to my 19,359,401. Sad.”

Trump used the last of his 23 tweets on the issue, to remind the PM of his responsibility to represent the Canadian people with integrity. “Honestly it’s such a deeply unprofessional method of communication for a head of state to use,” he tweeted.

890,,Trudeau Calls For Temporary Ban On American Politicians Entering Canada,"OTTAWA, ON—Justin Trudeau today moved a step closer to doing what no Canadian Prime Minister has done before, by admitting he is “considering” banning American politicians from the country.

In a ground-breaking speech broadcasted live across the entire nation, the Prime Minister outlined his “concerns” about certain U.S. lawmakers entering Canada.

“When America elects its politicians, they’re not electing their best,” Trudeau began, in front of a silent House of Commons.

“They’re electing politicians that have lots of problems, and they’re going to bring those problems here. They’ll bring lies. They’ll bring fear. They’re racists… And some I assume are good people,” he continued, stressing the importance of Canadian values being upheld and not influenced by recent events south of the border.

The ban, which Trudeau explained would begin initially on a trial period of approximately 2 years, would apply to all high-ranking bureaucrats of the United States. “In 2020 we can reassess and see how it’s working,” he added.

Cryptically, the PM did not mention any American “leaders” specifically at risk of exile from the Great White North, sending the rumour mill into overdrive. However, the reputable American broadcaster FOX News later exclusively revealed that Canada’s ban will be targeted at Obama and immediately called on President-elect Trump to oppose Canada’s potential action.

“This is just those Eskimos trying to stop us from shipping Obama back where he belongs,” respected journalist Sean Hannity said. “I’ve been saying it for years. We all know Obama was born in Canada, just look at his birth cert.”

However the Prime Minister denied the claims, insisting it’s “highly unlikely” the ban will ever be invoked, as any potential US politician would have to violate a number of “near-capital offences” relating to tax evasion, sexual assault and hate speech.

“They’d honestly have to be a total asshole for it ever to even happen,” he stressed.

892,,Melania Trump Accidentally Signs Name ‘Melania Trudeau’,"WASHINGTON, DC—The First Lady of the United States suffered a rather embarrassing moment at a recent Trump campaign rally after accidentally signing her name ‘Melania Trudeau’ to a fan.

Mrs Trump reportedly made the error while signing a Trump supporter’s MAGA hat, when he noticed she had written the surname of Canada’s Prime Minister instead.

According to the fan, the First Lady immediately began blushing and apologizing, saying, “Oh my I’m so sorry. I accidentally wrote Trudeau instead of… of…. of whatever my last name is… Oh yes…. Trump…. How could I forget….”

“She just kept apologizing and saying that she had been doing that a lot lately,” the supporter told the BSJ. “She ended up scratching out the Melania Trudeau name, which was a shame because it was written it in such beautiful cursive handwriting compared to the big block capital letters of TRUMP she replaced it with.”

“I told her that I thought the original signature looked a lot better and she just sighed at me and said ‘yeah, doesn’t it?’ “

President Trump tweeted that he believes his wife’s mistake could have been the work of pranksters, terrorists or even worse, Democrats.

“She probably just had the name Trudeau in her head because, like me, she’s been seeing his name written all over the White House recently. And not just in the mirror of Melania’s washroom but Ivanka’s too. The FBI must investigate.”

893,,Trump Proposes Nuking Amazon Rainforest To Stop Fire Spreading,"WASHINGTON, DC — The President of the United States believes he may have stop the spread of further wildfires in the Amazon Rainforest, by proposing the U.S. nuke the rainforest.

On the same day that Canada pledged $15 million and France pledged $20 million to help tackle the ongoing crisis, Trump discussed pledging over $100 million in nuclear missiles to be dropped directly on the northern Brazilian state of Rondonia.

Having last week reportedly asked why the the government hadn’t thought of nuking hurricanes before, Trump again reiterated his desire to see nuclear warheads solve problems posed by mother nature.

This idea reportedly came up during a recent Amazon Rainforest briefing, with Trump repeatedly asking aides to give him “one good reason” why detonating a nuclear bomb in Brazil was a bad idea.

“Will dropping nukes stop these fires or not?” the President eventually asked the room to which one senior climate expert responded, “well Sir technically yes but…” before being cut off by Trump who replied, “OK, problem solved. Do that and just throw a bunch of paper towels at Brazil and we’re good”.

“It’s exactly the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that got the man elected in the first place,” former Trump advisor Steve Bannon told Fox News. “Other people look at problems and think ‘how can we solve this without harming anyone’. Donald Trump looks at problems and thinks ‘we should drop a nuke on this and go golfing’. That’s why he’s the president of the United States.”

Trump also spoke at length about having been reassured of his plan by a close and trusted advisor.

“Honestly Vlad tells me that a little bit of nuclear radiation is perfectly fine and can actually really help an area thrive. Just look how wildlife is flourishing in Chernobyl. Why aren’t we doing that to the rainforests? Think about how great it will be for the wildlife that survives.”

A source close to the President said that in all likelihood, America’s major contribution to stopping the Amazon wildfires will be “preventing Trump from making the situation any worse”.

“It’s the best we can hope for,” she said, rolling her eyes and grabbing an old whiteboard with the words “Nukes = Bad” written in bright colourful markers.

894,,Trump Clarifies ‘Back Where They Came From’ Remark To Congresswomen By Insisting He Was Talking About The Kitchen,"WASHINGTON, DC—Donald Trump has this morning moved to clarify controversial remarks he made regarding a group of congresswomen, all of whom happen to be women of colour, after he was seen to be falsely implying that they weren’t natural-born American citizens.

Trump drew widespread criticism for his remarks which were deemed racist by most, forcing the American president to respond during his daily briefing with Fox and Friends.

Speaking to the show’s diverse panel of hosts, Trump explained that when he suggested that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar “should go back where they came from” he was simply referring to the kitchen and was definitely not suggesting that the women were not American based on the colour of their skin.

“Typical fake news media totally twisting my words,” Trump told Fox’s Brian Kilmeade. “In no way at all was I insinuating that these women should go back to their home countries, I was saying these broads should go back to the kitchen.”

“As long as they go back to their kitchens and shut up, I don’t care what country they go to,” he revealed, while still hinting that it would be “obviously preferable” if the women did in fact go back to their “own countries” all the same.

Trump continued, explaining how the brains of female congresswomen were simply not as big as men’s, and particular his, causing the women to get confused.

“Like, they think everything I say is racist or sexist. Women’s brains just can’t function like ours so they should go back where they will be so much happier, the kitchen.

As Mike [Pence] always says: ‘a woman’s place is in the kitchen, serving her husband and God’. I keep telling him ‘Mike it’s 2019, a woman’s place is also in the bedroom or the locker room or wherever I grab her’.

‘It’s a whole new world out there’ I say, but he doesn’t listen!”

When asked if he was referring to the kitchen the entire time, why did he describe these ‘places’ as ‘crime infested‘, Trump hesitated before talking at length about how not many people know that “so much” crime happens in the kitchen. “Haven’t you ever watched Dateline NBC?” he asked.

The network’s loyal viewership who tuned in Monday morning were treated to a shocking and unfamiliar sight with factual news stories researched using real sources and presented with no political or financial bias.

The morning began with a prepared statement read by the hosts of Fox’s flagship program.

“Good morning and welcome to Fox and Friends, today’s top story…” began Ainsley Earhardt suggesting nothing unusual was afoot.

“The president is actually not very good at his job and is making millions of Americans poorer and more unsafe each and every day,” she read, before Brian Kilmeade added, “Yes. He truly is a bigot, a traitor, a sexual predator and an embarrassment to this country. He should be in jail for the rest of his life.”

Understandably Fox’s audience was horrified.



“What the hell is this? Where’s the update on the violent dirty migrant caravan?” tweeted one befuddled Fox News viewer. “What the hell is that crap about the President’s approval rating being shit and immigrants not being scum? What the hell is going on?”



Among the many “fake” news stories published by Fox News was a strong rebuke of Judge Jeanine Pirro’s recent comments, labelling the Fox news host “a blatant racist”. There was an also an op-ed warning Fox viewers to “never EVER trust Sean Hannity” adding that he was simply “an actor playing a character of a mentally unstable asshole”.

A disclaimer under these stories on foxnews.com reassured readers that they were in fact reading a factual news story for April Fools Day and that “normal service would be resumed tomorrow”.

LEADING health officials across the United States have tonight warned against playing a drinking game during President Trump’s televised address to the nation.

The game, which involves drinking a shot every time Trump lies, has been branded “incredibly dangerous” and “will likely result in death” according to experts.

“Consuming that much alcohol, possibly as many as 100 shots in a minute is extremely dangerous and reckless,” Dr. Lisa Edelstein told CNN. “Please consume alcohol responsibly, perhaps closer to the level a regular politician lies.”

Despite the incredible health risks involved, the major U.S. news channels will continue broadcasting Trump’s speeches unedited, however as a compromise will air a health warning prior to and during his monologues on the dangers of immigration.

900,,Nation Wonders How Much More Fucking Evidence Mueller Needs Exactly,"After over a year of accumulating what many assume to be the most damning evidence ever against a sitting U.S. President, Americans today collectively wondered “how much more fucking evidence Robert Mueller needs exactly?”

Accusations of using campaign finances to bribe porn stars, colluding with Russian officials, and promising favouritism to certain companies have led to 19 indictments and 5 guilty pleas thus far. Now the overwhelming majority of Americans want to know what Bob Mueller needs to see exactly before making a decision.

“How much more fucking evidence does the guy need?” the U.S. populace questioned, stating that surely Mueller must be ready to make an announcement one way or another at this stage. “Like seriously, is Trump guilty or what?”

“What is it gonna take, video evidence of Trump literally murdering someone?” the nation queried, “That could take months to happen.”

Even Trump himself has called for Mueller to announce his findings. “Come on Bobby, show me your cards, whaddya got?” the President tweeted, reiterating his confidence that Mueller couldn’t possibly have evidence of everything he’s done.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world is currently wondering how much longer it should give America to sort its shit out before stepping in.

901,,President Trump Alleges He Was Sexually Assaulted By Hillary Clinton,"FUSSA, JAPAN—The President of the United States has begun his tour of Asia by making the astonishing revelation that he was personally sexually assaulted by Hillary Clinton.

Mr. Trump alleges the incident happened in October, 2016 during the second presidential debate with Mrs. Clinton and claims the DNC knowingly covered up the story to help her get elected.

BREAKING: Trump Urges Kevin Spacey To Consider Career In Politics

The shocking accusation came during a Q&A with the assembled press corps at Yokota Air Base as the President addressed the ongoing FBI investigation into his ties to the Russians.

“Are you at all concerned about the mounting investigation into your alleged collusion with the Russian government?” one local reporter asked, the first question.

Trump paused briefly to drink some water, cleared his throat, then appeared to read from a prepared statement.

“I’m beyond horrified to hear about these accusations. If there were ever links between me and Russia, I apologise. I honestly do not remember. I think the reason for this may have been because I was sexually assaulted by Hillary Clinton.”

As loud audible gasps were heard the stunned journalist sputtered, “excuse me?”

“Yes it’s true. It happened during the debates,” Trump said, removing his reading glasses. “She touched me in a very inappropriate way, and I’m an expert, believe me.”

“Bill watched, he enjoyed it. It was all very nasty. Hillary smirked at me but said nothing, except that I definitely did not have any problem down there.”

The revelation explains a cryptic tweet from the President earlier this morning that simply read “#MeToo”.

The President said the events of the past few weeks left him compelled to speak out saying “now was the right time”. He called on special counsel to the Russian investigation Robert Mueller, to immediately “drop everything” and focus solely on opening a full and thorough investigation into the allegations he just made.

“Didn’t she also rig the election and the DNC?” one RT journalist next asked Trump.

“Yes. She raped me, just like she raped Bernie,” he replied, before demanding Mueller add that to the growing list of atrocities committed by the Clintons and the Democratic Party.

‘Nothing else matters,” he concluded, instructing the press that he would no longer be answering questions on any topic other than his accusations against the Clintons for the remainder of his 11-day trip.
