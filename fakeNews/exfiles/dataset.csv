['Analysis John Harwood'],"But you don't need James Bond to recognize the fact that more than any other modern American president, Trump has delivered some of what the Kremlin values most.

The issue has returned to center stage over the last month as intelligence officials update Congress on Russia's stance toward this year's campaign. Different intelligence briefers have offered alternative assessments of whether Russia favors Trump for the presidency, as it did in his 2016 battle against Hillary Clinton.

Trump and his aides insist a 2020 bias toward him wouldn't make sense anyway. ""We've been very tough on Russia,"" national security adviser Robert O'Brien told a television interviewer last month.

In some specific ways, the administration has indeed been ""tough."" Trump has imposed new sanctions against Russian misbehavior, though reluctantly and under congressional pressure.

His Pentagon sent two aircraft carrier strike groups into the Mediterranean Sea last year to deter Russian aggression. Trump gave Ukraine lethal aid in its war with Russia.

""If you look at administration policy, it's not all that bad,"" said Steven Pifer, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine, of the Trump administration's Russia policy.

Yet those steps represent the smaller part of the story.

The larger part is how Trump has advanced what some experts say are Russian President Vladimir Putin's higher-level objectives: dividing the United States internally, eroding solidarity with European allies, reducing the projection of American power abroad and thereby enhancing the 21st century influence of a diminished Russian state.

Trump, who privately sought a Moscow real estate project as a 2016 candidate, frames his presidential strategy as ""America First."" It envisions friendlier relations with Russia as helpful in resolving thorny foreign policy problems while he secures more favorable economic terms from longtime allies.

But Russia policy specialists see important benefits for Moscow.

After winning in 2016, Trump disdained the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia intervened on his behalf. That buttressed Moscow's attempt to disavow culpability.

Trump has assailed not just Democratic adversaries but also nonpartisan institutions such as the judiciary and the Federal Reserve, eroding public confidence in the American system itself. He has attacked executive branch officials serving under him as a hostile ""deep state."" The lagging federal response to the coronavirus highlights the consequences of his governance.

Pressed by one interviewer in 2017 on his expression of respect for Russia's president, Trump defended Putin by yielding the moral high ground on which his predecessors staked the claim of American exceptionalism.

""You think our country's so innocent?"" he asked.

Steve Hall oversaw US intelligence in countries of the former Soviet Union before retiring from the CIA in 2015 and is a CNN national security analyst. He says Putin wants a weakened US and Trump ""is currently the person on the political horizon who does the best job of that for him.""

Trump sapped Western unity by slapping trade tariffs on allies in the name of ""national security."" He became the first US President in the 70-year history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to cast doubt on America's commitment to defend member states from outside attacks by Russia or other adversaries.

Trump discusses security commitments in commercial terms, suggesting they remain contingent on financial concessions from allies. Uncertainty about the protective US umbrella rattles allies to Moscow's benefit.

""Every time the President says, 'Gee, they haven't paid 2% and maybe we won't support them,' Putin thinks that's good,"" Pifer said. ""You measure power in relative terms. This is the advancement of Russian power.""

""If you give Putin the choice -- destroy NATO but live with Ukraine getting arms -- he'd take it,"" added Duke University scholar Peter Feaver, a National Security Council special adviser to President George W. Bush. Trump's equivocation leaves his subordinates to reassure NATO of American resolve.

Trump's abrupt announcement of troop withdrawals from Syria last year alarmed even staunch Republican supporters. The decision, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned, ""would only benefit Russia, Iran and the Assad regime"" in Damascus.

And the President undercut his own signature ""tough-on-Russia"" initiative in the episode that led to his impeachment. He delayed military aid while pressuring a newly elected Ukrainian leader to announce investigations of what he called ""corruption.""

One sought negative information about potential Democratic election rival Joe Biden. Another concerned whether Ukraine rather than Russia actually intervened in the 2016 election -- a notion Trump's former National Security Council official Fiona Hill calls a Russian propaganda fiction.

Lately the 2020 landscape Moscow confronts has changed significantly.

Just two weeks ago, the front-runner to oppose Trump was Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-styled ""democratic socialist"" who shares Trump's skepticism about projecting American military power abroad.

Now, Biden's emergence presents an option more like that in 2016, pitting Trump's record against a more traditionally adversarial approach to US-Russia relations.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/69JHJ-ccCVY/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE
['Paul Gittings'],"(CNN) Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe insisted Saturday that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer as planned despite growing fears about the viability of staging the Games amid the global coronavirus pandemic.

With a string of global sporting events being halted in a response to the crisis, Abe has moved to dampen speculation that the Games, due to take place from July 24 to August 9, could be postponed, or even canceled.

""We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned,"" Abe told the news conference in Tokyo, but added the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would have the final decision whether Tokyo 2020 takes place.

His comments came after Tokyo 2020 organizers announced that the Greek leg of the Olympic torch relay had been canceled, but also insisted the Games would go ahead on schedule.

['Luke Mcgee'],"London (CNN) The outbreak of the novel coronavirus is causing political misery for some of the most powerful people on earth. It has, however, left one world leader in a uniquely difficult position.

Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, is having to deal with this public health emergency at the same time a clock is ticking on the United Kingdom's next Brexit deadline: July 1. This pending deadline is far more significant than anything that has happened in the Brexit process to date.

The UK is currently in a transition period with the European Union, set to expire on December 31. The point of this transition was to maintain a standstill in relations between the EU and the UK after Brexit happened on January 31, so to avoid an economic cliff edge.

The two sides are currently negotiating their future relationship and hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before the end of the year. If they can't, then the UK leaves the transition period with no formal agreement on trade or any other strategic areas. The joint decision to scrap next week's round of talks will lead to fears that such an agreement cannot be done in time.Legally, the transition period can be extended, but it would have to be done before July 1 of this year. That's the point of no return.

Until the transition period ends, the UK is playing by EU rules and paying money for the privilege, but with no seat at the tables of power in Brussels. In other words, it is still essentially an EU member state, but with zero influence on EU policy.

JUST WATCHED Here's what you need to know about Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Here's what you need to know about Brexit 03:38

Naturally, this is an uncomfortable position for long-standing Brexiteers -- not least Johnson himself, who led the successful leave campaign in 2016. So, it's hardly surprising that the official position of the British government is that Johnson will not request an extension under any circumstances.

However, that stance was decided before the nation was gripped by coronavirus panic.

""However politically painful it might be for the government, the impact of the coronavirus will reach far beyond the public health implications and into the heart of our economy,"" says Wes Streeting, an opposition Labour lawmaker. ""In good times, leaving the EU on the timetable announced by the government would be a challenge. Trying to stick to that timetable purely for political reasons would be irresponsible.""

The UK is already living some of those implications. Panic-buying has led to shortages of many everyday household products, most notably toilet paper. And if you think empty shelves are a problem now, consider this: according to the Confederation of Paper Industries, the UK imports about 60% of the materials used to make tissue products from the EU. And up to 55% of that demand is for toilet paper.

Some in Brussels wonder if a time will come when experts advising Johnson tell him that, given the scale of the coronavirus problem, refusing to extend the transition period and throwing trade links and supply chains out the window is a bad idea. And if trade talks with the EU slow because of coronavirus, meaning that nothing has been agreed come June, can Johnson really risk food, medicine and other shortages for the sake of saving face?

""Now that future relationship talks are being interrupted, it is inevitable that both sides will have to start considering possible extensions,"" says Agata Gostyńska-Jakubowska at the Centre for European Reform, based in Brussels.

However, she adds: ""The request should come from the British government and, obviously, an extension wouldn't come without costs for the UK. Questions, including the financial contributions, will have to be taken. There is no such thing as a free lunch.""

While Brussels might already be thinking about this, the unknown is what Johnson would actually do if he were given the advice to request an extension. And European officials are increasingly convinced that Johnson is still in denial about how serious things could get.

An EU diplomatic source tells CNN: ""It doesn't seem to have sunk in entirely just how different supply chains will look after the transition. Right now, there are hangers full of food sat in ports across Europe. If someone calls at 7 a.m., they can be in British shops that afternoon. The UK imports the vast majority of its toilet paper, so if you kill supply chains you are literally in the s***.""

Two issues collide

Johnson has made a point during the coronavirus outbreak of stressing that the government is making decisions based on the advice it is getting from medical experts. It's certainly true that Johnson has placed his most senior public health officials front and center in recent weeks. Sources close to Downing Street claim that this approach is being driven by Dominic Cummings, Johnson's most senior adviser.

Cummings is known to be obsessed with scientists, data and evidence, so it stands to reason that he would ask government advisers not to brief and encourage the PM to take his cues from the experts. However, this is the same Dominic Cummings who is driving Johnson's Brexit agenda and is thought to have been behind the decision to say publicly that there would be no extension under any circumstances.

So, what will happen when these two distinct issues collide? There is no question that requesting an extension would be very difficult and embarrassing for Johnson. ""If he doesn't want an extension then it's fine, but if he wants one, they [The EU] will have him over a barrel on fishing and financial contributions,"" says Hugo Dixon, referring to two of the thorniest issues currently blighting negotiations. ""It's not just that he will have to go back on his word of no extension under no circumstances, he will have to bite those two bitter pills.""

Exactly how damaging requesting an extension could be for Johnson would have to be weighed against the fallout of no deal, or a very limited trade deal. ""It's entirely possible that the UK suffers a recession in the coming months because of coronavirus, only to then have another recession because of Brexit,"" says Dixon.

While back-to-back recessions would seem difficult for any leader to ride out, Brexit has done weird things to the UK's domestic politics. As the diplomatic source explains: ""Johnson has already laid the groundwork domestically to frame no deal as a fight against EU colonialism versus the UK being able to do what it wants.""

Dixon believes that this could be the easiest political option for Johnson. ""He could bite all the bullets at once and try to ride it out before 2024, when we are out the woods and he can fight an election.""

For the time being, no deal with Europe seems to be the logical endpoint. Dmitry Grozoubinski, founder of explaintrade.com, says that while the Covid-19 crisis could ""focus minds on the need to find a compromise,"" it could also ""rob the negotiations of all political attention, removing any pressure from politicians to back off their currently irreconcilable red lines and leading to a WTO-Brexit crashout largely on autopilot.""

It seems likely when you consider that the EU's patience for British politics wore thin ages ago. ""We are moving to the stage where we don't really care, whatever they do,"" says the diplomatic source.

And while the source believes that the coronavirus gives Johnson ""a way out if he does want to delay for a year,"" they point out that it ""has to come in June -- legally, that is the deadline.""

However, some hold onto the slim hope that the evidence becomes so compelling Johnson has to listen. Gostyńska-Jakubowska points out that when Johnson drew his red lines, ""we didn't have Covid-19. This might encourage the British government to listen to business more carefully."" And Dixon reminds us that Johnson has form for folding when the need for an agreement with Brussels is great: ""The EU won't have forgotten that he essentially gave them everything they wanted last October.""

Both Johnson and the EU are currently close to capacity dealing with the coronavirus crisis. And as the July 1 deadline races up on Johnson, he is likely going to face pressure to consider extending the Brexit transition to avoid economic catastrophe. ""Short-term political pain for Boris is a price worth paying when compared with the medium to long-term risks of getting something like this badly wrong,"" says Streeting.

The great unknown is whether Johnson -- and Cummings -- can be convinced that the risk of going beyond the point of return this summer is really bad enough to perform what would be a staggering U-turn. And though we might not know what they think now, we won't have to wait long to find out.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/iXILuoMKNZQ/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE

"['Julia Horowitz', 'Cnn Business']","London (CNN Business) Companies have spent the years since the global financial crisis binging on debt. Now, as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to push the world into recession , the bill could come due — exacerbating damage to the economy and feeding a meltdown in financial markets.

Looking to take advantage of low interest rates , companies have rushed in recent years to issue bonds whose proceeds could be used to grow their businesses. Corporate debt among non-banks exploded to $75 trillion at the end of 2019, up from $48 trillion at the end of 2009, according to the Institute of International Finance.

As the coronavirus spreads — touching off a plunge in oil prices and a collapse in travel, and shutting factories from Italy to China — there is increasing alarm that companies in the energy, hospitality and auto sectors won't be able tomake their bond payments. That could trigger a spree of ratings downgrades and defaults that would further destabilize financial markets and compound the economic shock.

""This certainly is another match being lit [near] the bonfire of corporate debt liabilities,"" said Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics. ""There's definitely potential for systemic risk.""

The coronavirus shock

Investors became increasingly anxious about corporate debt this week as stocks sold off and crude prices nosedived. The ability to buy or sell securities in corporate debt markets has become much more difficult. And the extra returns that investors are demanding to hold corporate debt over more stable government bonds have shot up, signaling that they're now viewed as much riskier holdings.

SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK Thedropped more than 6% this week, while the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF fell more than 8%. Bank of America told clients on Friday that volatility had skyrocketed and outflows from corporate bond funds were at record highs.

The anxiety is pegged to companies that rely on stable energy prices and tourism to generate cash. When business gets tougher for these firms, it could prevent them from servicing their debt, leading to defaults. Ratings agencies could also start downgrading many of these companies, forcing some bondholders to sell.

""Default and downgrade risks have increased to their highest levels since the start of the current business cycle,"" Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist at Goldman Sachs, told clients this week.

Much of the risk lies with energy companies, which have ramped up borrowing in recent years to build pipelines and fund other projects. Those companies now face acute pressure due to plummeting oil prices, which have dropped 50% since early January amid evaporating demand for fuel and the implosion of an alliance between major energy producers Saudi Arabia and Russia that had helped prevent oil from flooding onto global markets.

""Oil producers who were depending on the higher prices to pay back their loans so they could drill for oil are under a significant amount of stress,"" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a consultancy based in Houston.

Chesapeake Energy CHK Whiting Petroleum Corporation WLL Investors dumped shares this week in two US energy companies that Morgan Stanley said are at risk of default within the next year:and. Chesapeake's stock fell to 15 cents on Thursday, while Whiting shares closed at 75 cents.

Airlines, hotels and cruise lines are also in trouble as restrictions on movement grow and more people hunker down at home. A ban on travel from Europe to the United States, announced by the Trump administration on Wednesday, eviscerated airline shares. Budget carrier Norwegian Air, which is heavily indebted, said it would temporarily lay off up to half its workers after its stock dropped 22% on Thursday.

American Airlines AAL Alaska Air ALK ""Coronavirus' rapidly increasing effect on air travel is placing downward pressure on global airline credit profiles, especially as there are risks that demand takes materially longer than previous shocks to recover,"" Fitch Ratings said Thursday. It is monitoring, which has a significant amount of debt, as well as, which is based in Seattle, the site of a significant outbreak in the United States.

A flight arrival information board displays cancelled flights at an airport in Japan.

Automakers are under the microscope, too, as factories in Italy shut down, with more potential closures looming across Europe and in the United States as the number of infections rises in those areas. The industry was already in its third year of a sales recession because of falling demand for vehicles and the US-China trade war.

Who holds the debt?

With the risk of downgrades and defaults growing, the focus for investors then turns to who holds those liabilities, which could rapidly lose their value.

Banks are less exposed to risky corporate debt than they were to bad mortgages in 2008, according to Capital Economics' MacAdam. But that doesn't mean there isn't potential for a corporate debt crisis to reverberate through the financial system.

One issue is the growing number of corporate bonds that are rated BBB, at the very low end of the spectrum of what is considered ""investment grade"" debt. If those bonds get downgraded to high-yield or ""junk"" status, investment funds could be forced to dump them based on their mandates. That could further stress the market and cause liquidity to dry up.

In 2011, corporate bonds rated BBB made up about a third of the market, according to Capital Economics. Today, such bonds account for nearly half of it.

Lots of debt issued by energy companies fits that description. An estimated 67% of investment grade debt issued by energy companies is rated BBB, compared to 50% overall, according to Morgan Stanley. And $34 billion of BBB-rated energy debt is already on negative credit watch from one or more ratings agencies.

Plus, so-called ""shadow banks"" — or financial entities that face far less regulation than traditional lenders — have snapped up large amounts of corporate liabilities. A decade of persistently low interest rates has pushed down yields on safer government bonds, encouraging private equity firms, hedge funds and even pension funds to buy riskier assets with higher returns.

""As the economic cycle matures and investors have picked all the low-hanging fruit — the good, solid investments that give a solid return and aren't too risky — you're naturally going to be looking for riskier and riskier things that years ago you wouldn't have touched with a barge pole,"" MacAdam said.

Emre Tiftik, director of global policy initiatives at the Institute of International Finance, said it's difficult to determine just how vulnerable these players are.

""We really don't know that much about private equity and hedge fund exposure,"" he said.

Seeding systemic risk

In its most recent financial stability report, the International Monetary Fund raised the alarm about piles of risky corporate debt, which it said could amplify problems and deepen the next recession.

The group conducted a stress test based on a hypothetical economic shock that's half as severe as the 2008 global financial crisis. The results suggested that corporate debt worth $19 trillion from eight countries — China, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and Germany — is at risk of default in a future downturn of that magnitude because companies would struggle to generate enough cash to meet repayments. That would be 40% of all corporate debt.

A wave of defaults, or even a series of rating downgrades and repricing, would shake the financial system.

""The credit market is moving quickly towards the point of no return, where the turn in the credit cycle becomes inevitable and irreversible, as funding sources dry up, issuers face liquidity crunch, credit losses rise, investors rush for the exit, and face extremely thin liquidity on the way out,"" Oleg Melentyev, head of high-yield credit strategy at Bank of America, told clients Friday.

And while this is a standard end to a credit cycle, Melentyev said, it appears to be playing out at three to four times normal speed.

Should the situation deteriorate further, it will also have economic consequences as companies hurry to reduce their debt burdens, the IMF noted. There could be waves of layoffs, and business investment could fall off. Defaults would also hit banks and could lead to less lending. Companies could find it more difficult to borrow during the period when they need it the most.

This would exacerbate a global recession caused by the coronavirus, which a growing number of economists now warn is a real possibility.

The expectation is that if the world does tip into recession, it would be sharp but short, with the global economy bouncing back as soon as the threat of the virus recedes. But credit risk in the system incorporates a big question mark.

"['Kathryn Vasel', 'Cnn Business']","(CNN) Workers throughout the country are finding themselves working from a new office : their homes.

As coronavirus continues to spread throughout the country, companies are asking employees to work remotely to help control contagion.

At first, working from home might seem like a dream: no commute, no distracting co-workers and think of all those chores you'll be able to sneak in!

But after the novelty wears off, things get real. It can be lonely . Your home suddenly feels a lot smaller. And there's no real end to your work day.

""I think the biggest thing that is underestimated is the psychological impact of being alone,"" said David Hassell co-founder and CEO of 15Five, a performance management software provider, where 40% of the workers are remote.

Here are some tips to stay well-balanced:

Take a break

Let's be honest: You don't work eight hours straight in the office. There are coffee breaks, lunch walks and chats with co-workers that give some respite from work.

Just because you are working from home doesn't mean you aren't entitled to the same breathers.

""There is a tendency to work throughout the day to overcome some stigma that you aren't working when not in the office,"" said David Rabin, vice president of global commercial marketing at Lenovo.

Hitting the pause button throughout the work day can be a boon to productivity.

""It's not going to take anything from your effectiveness,"" said Julie Morgenstern, an organization and productivity consultant and author of ""Organizing from the Inside Out."" ""Stepping away for breaks are part of productivity; they actually make you smarter and give you perspective and answers.""

Get structured, but not too much

It will take a little time to get into your groove working from a different environment.

If you were the office worker who liked to bounce around from your desk to a conference room table to a private meeting room to get your work done, don't feel like you have to limit yourself to one spot in your house, advised Rabin.

But be thoughtful about where you choose to work and make sure to match the environment to the type of work you are doing, suggested Morgenstern. For instance, find a quiet area to work for some deep thinking, while sitting outside on your patio might work to respond to emails and other housekeeping-type tasks.

And make sure to designate some places as work-free zones.

""You should preserve some spaces in your home that you never do work in,"" she added. ""It is very hard to relax at night when you start to associate those spaces with work.""

Repurpose your commute

A major perk of working from home is ditching the commute. But that doesn't mean your work day can start earlier.

""Use your commute time in the morning for self-renewal or family time, not work,"" recommended Morgenstern.

Set very clear boundaries

""Working from home doesn't mean you are working more hours,"" warned Morgenstern. Be clear with your manager and coworkers of your schedule and stick to it.

And when your work day ends, put away your work equipment and change into your evening or lounge clothes to help signal the shift to personal time.

You also have to be clear with the other members of your household who might be wanting your attention during the workday. This could be particularly challenging if schools close.

""Create some structure to the day and designate play and work time while organizing space into work and play areas, recommended Morgenstern. ""You have to impose some order.""

Show your face

When possible, use video over the standard conference call to help create more interactions and avoid loneliness.

Three times a week all the employees at 15Five, whether they work from home or are in the office, get on a video call, for an all-hands meeting.

""We can see everyone's faces since everyone is on their own laptop with their own camera -- that is really important,"" said Hassell.

Force social collisions

Working from home means no popping into your colleague's office to chat or running into someone on your way to the bathroom and discussing weekend plans.

""When those drive-by connections are missing,"" said Morgenstern, ""If you are energized by being around other people, it can be despairing.""

But social interaction can still happen from home -- you just have to be more proactive. Set up regular check-ins with your team or manager that allows you to not only provide progress updates, but also sort through any problems or brainstorm ideas.

Use FaceTime, Zoom and other video tools during meetings or just to chat with coworkers to help avoid loneliness.

At 15Five, there are two Slack channels that provide a discussion space for workers.

One is more formal where people discuss what they are working on and other business-related subjects while the other one, called ""water-cooler,"" is more casual, where people post more personal messages and funny images.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/fHnZBEs2rZA/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE
"['John Defterios', 'Cnn Business']","London (CNN Business) Oil prices have suffered their biggest fall since the day in 1991 when American forces launched air strikes on Iraqi troops following their invasion of Kuwait.

Monday's crash spooked markets that were already freaking out about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy and demand for oil. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, were down 22%, last trading at $35.45 per barrel. US oil is trading at $33.15 per barrel, a decline of nearly 20%.

Here are five things you need to know:

Why are oil prices crashing?

Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, launched a price war over the weekend. The move followed the implosion of an alliance between the OPEC cartel, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia.

The kingdom and Russia came together to form the so-called OPEC+ alliance in 2016 after oil prices plunged to $30 a barrel. Since then, the two leading exporters have orchestrated supply cuts of 2.1 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia wanted to increase that number to 3.6 million barrels through 2020 to take account of weaker consumption.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin, worried about ceding too much ground to American oil producers, refused to go along with the plan and his energy minister, Alexander Novak on Friday signaled a fierce battle to come for market share when he said countries could produce as much as they please from April 1.

Why did Saudi launch a price war?

Simmering differences over how best to manage global oil markets spilled into the open at a meeting between OPEC and Russia in Vienna on Friday. After Russia said it was ditching the alliance, Saudi Arabia warned it would live to regret the decision, sources who attended the meeting told CNN Business.

The oil price war follows a rift between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, over how best to balance world energy markets.

Moscow had become tired of cutting production to stabilize prices and felt that the policy of supply restraint gave more room for US shale companies to grow. Mikhail Leontiev, a spokesperson for Russian state oil company Rosneft, described the OPEC+ deal as ""masochism.""

""By yielding our own markets, we remove cheap Arab and Russian oil to clear a place for expensive US shale oil and ensure the effectiveness of its production,"" he told Russian state media on Sunday.

America has become the number one oil producer in the world and is expected to pump about 13 million barrels a day in the first quarter of this year.

Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia decided to fight for greater market share by slashing the prices its preferred customers pay by between $4-$7 a barrel. The kingdom is also reportedly planning to lift production to over 10 million barrels a day.

What does coronavirus have to do with all of this?

The coronavirus has undermined energy demand worldwide, but especially in China, which is now the number one importer of crude oil, guzzling roughly 10 million barrels a day.

Factories have been idled and thousands of flights canceled around the world as the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, has become a global pandemic.

The International Energy Agency said Monday that it expects demand will contract this year for the first time since the recession in 2009 that followed the global financial crisis.

Which countries will be hurt the most?

A price war in the face of collapsing demand is not a recipe for oil stability.

It is difficult to see any winners: the major oil producing countries will lose money regardless of the market share they can claw back. Russia claims to be the most insulated to lower prices because its annual budget is based on an average price of roughly $40 a barrel. US sanctions have forced it to become more efficient.

The Gulf countries produce oil at the lowest cost — estimated at $2-$6 a barrel in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates — but due to high government spending and generous subsidies for citizens, they need a price in the range of $70 a barrel or higher to balance their budgets.

Oil dependent states that have suffered from years of conflict, uprisings or sanctions will pay the heaviest price. Iraq, Iran, Libya and Venezuela all belong in that category. But the United States won't escape either. The shale oil boom has brought with it an economic windfall for some states, and low prices will hurt oil companies.

Will it have an impact on consumers?

Big importing nations such as China, India and Germany could get some much needed relief from falling energy bills.

And consumers benefit in general from lower oil prices and the resulting decline in gas prices at the pump, especially in the United States where retail markets react more directly to supply and demand. Taxes and surcharges make up a higher share of pump prices in Europe, so the effect is less marked.

But any reduction in gas prices will likely be outweighed by the dislocation to the economy caused by the coronavirus led slowdown in global growth.

Then there's the impact this price war will have on US oil producers and energy jobs in states such as Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico and North Dakota, who have enjoyed a boom over the last decade.

"['Laura He', 'Cnn Business']","Hong Kong (CNN Business) China's automotive and aviation industries suffered historic drops in activity in February as the government locked down cities and restricted travel to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Car sales in China collapsed 79% compared to a year ago, according to data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers on Thursday. It was the biggest ever monthly decline, according to Reuters . Only 310,000 vehicles were sold.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include electric or plug-in hybrid cars, plummeted 75% to 12,908, even though the government has been pushing hard for the adoption of such cars.

The country's aviation regulator also released dire figures, saying that the industry recorded its worst financial performance ever in February. Passenger traffic plummeted 85% from a year earlier to 8.3 million people, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Cargo traffic decreased 21%.

Flights are still struggling. Only 40% of domestic flights had resumed by Sunday, according to the regulator.

"['Nell Lewis', 'Cnn Business']","London (CNN) Imagine being stuck in traffic for 243 hours , equivalent to just over 10 days. Rush hour commuters in Bangalore, a city in southern India, spent around that time in traffic last year.

The city has the worst congestion in the world, according to the 2019 TomTom Traffic Index , overtaking Mumbai, which held the title for the previous two years.

Bangalore's rapid expansion as India's tech capital is partly responsible. The number of cars on the roads has rocketed from 1.4 million in 2000 to more than 8 million in 2019.

But tech could also provide the solution, as startups have sprung up to break the gridlock.

Take Bounce , a Bangalore-based scooter-hire company with a fleet of more than 17,000 electric and gasoline vehicles in its home city. Customers can rent a scooter via its app for as little as 14 rupees (19 cents) an hour.

Founded in 2014, Bounce now operates in more than 30 cities in India with both a docked and dockless model, where you can pick up or drop off the bike anywhere in the city. It claims more than 120,000 rides are taken on its scooters in Bangalore every day.

In January, the startup received a fresh $105 million in funding, taking its overall capital to more than $200 million, Varun Agni, its CTO and co-founder, tells CNN Business. This led to its latest public valuation of $500 million, he adds.

While the initial motivation behind Bounce was ""democratizing the commute"" and providing affordable access to mobility for all, one major byproduct has been a reduction in traffic, says Agni.

Four in 10 users start or end at a subway station, he says. ""This has a massive impact on reducing traffic and congestion,"" as it encourages people to use public transport rather than using a car for the whole trip, he adds.

It also has an impact on the environment, especially as the company introduces more electric scooters to its fleet; by the end of the year, at least half of its vehicles will be electric, says Agni.

Cutting cars and carbon emissions

Quick Ride , a carpooling company also founded in Bangalore, aims to create a sustainable commuting option while cutting the number of vehicles on the roads, reducing fuel consumption and minimizing CO2 emissions, the company tells CNN Business.

It estimates it has saved 90,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions since its founding in 2015, equivalent to that emitted by 19,000 passenger vehicles in one year.

Using its app, drivers connect with passengers on the same route and fill their empty car seats. Quick Ride's system allows them to share the cost of the journey using fixed per-kilometer charges and it manages the payments through user accounts, removing the need for cash exchanges.

It operates in nine cities across India with a total of 3.5 million users, almost a third of which are based in Bangalore. The company says it has raised a total of $15.5 million in funding.

Heavy traffic in Bangalore.

Capgemini CAPMF Companies including consulting firmhave partnered with Quick Ride to encourage employees to carpool, as part of their corporate sustainability strategy.

More than 70% of employees signed up to Capgemini's #CAReToShare campaign in 2019, and since the start of the program in 2017 they have clocked up more than 33 million kilometers in carpool journeys, the company says.

""This program was launched with the dual objective of making the daily commute for our employees more convenient, while trying to ease the pollution plaguing our cities,"" Vijay Chandramohan, senior director of India's corporate real estate services for Capgemini, tells CNN Business.

""Cities in India are growing at an exponential rate,"" he says. ""There is tremendous pressure on the city roads, leading to increasing traffic snarls and commute time resulting in frustration and loss of productivity.""

['Amy Chillag'],"(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees.""

""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore.""

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

"['Bill Weir', 'Cnn Climate Correspondent']","Miami (CNN) In a city where ""sunny day floods"" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of ""location, location, location.""

In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.

And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.

While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.

Even now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.

""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now.""

The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.

In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are.

Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.

Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.

But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.

They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.

""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude.""

Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.

""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'""

Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.

After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.

Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.

A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.

They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide.""

She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.

""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.

""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.""

He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.

But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government.""

A woman uses an umbrella for shade as she walks on a hot day in Miami.

""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet.""

Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.

""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says.

But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a ""climate apartheid"" that the United Nations warns is ahead , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.

And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/pbQjkbD_bFk/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE
['Stephanie Bailey'],"(CNN) Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

Spend wisely

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.

""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying.""

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.

Divestment

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.

Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""

Wealth means power

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.

""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.

""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained.

Fund climate research

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.

In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.

""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

Role models

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.

""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like.""

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.

""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.

""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/Pa_SMoc1110/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE

Last season, Satoshi Kondo's first collection for Issey Miyake was a viral sensation. Replete with helicoptering dresses, skateboarders and floating models, it was hard not to see it as a joyful statement of his arrival as the label's new designer, replacing Yoshiyuki Miyamae after an eight-year stint.

""I was really surprised by the positive feedback and positive response on social media,"" said Satoshi Kondo during the dress rehearsal for his Autumn-Winter 2020/21 show, staged at the Lycée Carnot, a school in Paris. ""That was something I didn't expect at all. I was really thrilled because at the time the Issey Miyake brand didn't have an Instagram account.""

The question this February at Paris Fashion Week was, what would he do to follow that up?

""As a designer I feel like Issey Miyake has always been a brand that focuses on the joy of making, and I think I can bring, as I did last season, the joy that people feel when they really enjoy the clothes they wear,"" he said.

Since establishing the Miyake Design Studio in Tokyo, Issey Miyake has revolutionized what is considered luxury wear -- by pushing beyond Western silhouettes with the introducing of more drape, loose lines and pleating, and by showing that wearability and playfulness can be synonymous with innovation and glamour.

With a habit of promoting-up within the company -- Kondo-san had been at the label for 13 years already -- rather than introducing new leadership from outside, the house of Issey Miyake seems very much a tight-knit family -- albeit a highly creative, industrious one - working towards a common goal. And though he stepped back from daily design duties in 1999, Issey-san and Kondo-san speak regularly.

""There are times when I talk to Mr. Miyake every day, and there are times when I talk to him once or twice a week, but we have always been exchanging ideas""

""It is just casual conversation, but I get advice not only on clothes and design but more generally from Mr Miyake. This restaurant is really good, you should go see this movie, things like that.""

For his sophomore effort, Kondo-san reunited with choreographer Daniel Ezralow, his collaborator from last season, to create a stage show that was more subtle in execution, but still brimming with possibilities.

""It's a message as simple as that, but that's my attitude and my goal as a designer,"" Kondo-san said. ""Issey Miyake has always been a brand that's looking ahead, looking forward. There is something for the future which is also the idea of giving hope.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/pMGrPqtstW4/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE

Depending on the alleged offense or the patrol unit, the defectors said some offenders were made to stand in the middle of a town's square and endure harsh criticism from officers. Others were ordered to perform hard labor.

""Many women are instructed or advised by (their) house, school or organization to wear tidy clothes and (have a) clean appearance,"" explains Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University.

They may have been living in one of the world's most restrictive states, but Kang says she and other North Korean millennials still kept up with fashion trends outside the country.

It's easy, she says, if you know where to look.

Black market culture

Translated as ""marketplace,"" Jangmadang is the name given to the local North Korean markets that sell everything from fruit, clothing and household products. They started prospering during the great famine in the 1990s when people realized they couldn't depend on government rations.

Many North Koreans still shop at these markets for daily necessities, but they are also the source of illegal products smuggled into the country. Foreign content, including movies, music videos, and soap operas, is copied onto USB drives , CDs or SD Cards in South Korea or China and smuggled into North Korea, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry.

This is also a method that many human rights organizations use to send in information challenging the regime.

""North Korean young urbanites are getting culture from the outside world,"" says Sokeel Park, South Korea country director of research and strategy for human rights group Liberty in North Korea.

""This has an effect even in fashion trends, hair styles and beauty standards inside North Korea,"" adds Park. ""If young North Koreans watch South Korean TV programs, they may want to change their hair or clothes to what South Koreans look like.""

Before she fled North Korea in 2010, defector and now jewelry designer Joo Yang says she and her friends used to visit the Jangmadang markets to find USB sticks with films and popular music videos from South Korea.

At the market, Yang says female smugglers would talk in a distinct Seoul accent to attract the attention of young women who had already been exposed to South Korean culture. Sometimes merchants would take customers to their homes where there would be rooms full of clothes and cosmetics, according to Yang.

South Korean cosmetics were two to three times more expensive than North Korean or Chinese-made products, she says. She had to pay two weeks' worth of rice to purchase a single mascara or lipstick from South Korea.

The marketplace is so popular with millennials that they are referred as the ""Jangmadang generation,"" says Park, who produced a documentary by the same name examining the lives of young North Koreans and their impact on society.

The famine disrupted the schooling system, so many of the Jangmadang generation literally grew up shopping in the markets, and have a greater insight into capitalism than previous generations, he adds.

Yang says she has seen the style of women in North Korea evolve based on the looks of popular K-dramas.

""If young North Koreans watch South Korean TV programs, then they may want to change their hair or clothes to what South Koreans look like. So this has an effect on fashion trends, hairstyles and beauty standards in North Korea,"" says Park. He adds fashion and beauty trends extend beyond the surface, they signal an implicit change within the society.

North Korea's beauty industry

Despite the absence of internationally-recognized North Korean cosmetics brands, North Korea's state media KCNA claims its cosmetics industry is thriving. In November, Pyongyang hosted a national cosmetics show where ""more than 137,000 beauty products"" were presented, including ""new soaps to help remove waste matter from skin and functional cosmetics (to help) blood circulation, beauty goods and anti-aging cosmetics"" according to KCNA.

Kim Jong Un is building on the legacy of his grandfather, North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung who created the country's first cosmetics factory in 1949 . Kim Il Sung, who had previously used cosmetics to boost the morale of female soldiers in Manchuria during the battle with Japan, realized the power of beauty in changing people's minds early on. Following his footsteps, the younger Kim is investing in state-run brands Unhasu and Bomhyanggi to develop the ""world's best cosmetics,"" state news agency KCNA reported in 2017

The recent push to develop the domestic cosmetic industry comes amid deepening international sanctions, which have made it even more difficult for North Korea to import high-quality ingredients and products, according to Professor Nam.

Nam said Kim saw also an opportunity in the growing popularity of South Korean beauty products to produce his own version of Korean cosmetics for export, taking inspiration from the packaging of South Korean products as well as their popular ingredients like ginseng.

Earlier this year, KCNA reported that the domestic Sinuiju cosmetics factory had ""developed various functional cosmetics like eyelashes growth serums and beauty masks for acne treatment,"" and was exporting them to other countries like Russia and China.

'Beauty is freedom'

Locally-made cosmetics might be readily available in North Korea, but they don't have the same cache or variety as foreign brands.

People who wear smuggled foreign cosmetics are not only experimenting with their own looks, but trying to push the boundaries of what's acceptable in North Korea, Park said.

""You are wearing clothes that you are not really supposed to, which has been influenced by illegal foreign media,"" he said. ""Then you're signaling to your community and to your friends that you are kind of different and willing to break these rules that are at least low level.""

Pyongyang's attempts to control citizens' personal choices can only go so far, wrote North Korean culture expert at Dong-A University, Professor Dong-wan Kang, in a government-commissioned paper on the topic of South Korea's influence on the hermit kingdom.

""Although North Korean authorities crack down on fashion and hairstyles of the so-called decadent culture of capitalism, there is a limit to the total control of their citizens' desire and needs,"" writes Kang.

""Following South Korean influences on clothing, makeup and hair disrupts everyday expectations and can lead to dissatisfaction and skepticism about the North Korean regime. Mimicking South Korea, they are deviating from the society and it shows that a subculture has been formed as a factor of regime resistance.""

Both Yang and Nara Kang say in South Korea they are able to express themselves in a way they weren't allowed to before.

""When I first went to a cosmetics store in South Korea, I swear I thought I went to a toy store in North Korea because there was a huge variety of colors like toys,"" recalls Kang.

""For me, beauty is freedom,"" she says. ""Now I have more ownership over my beauty.""

Yang said a lot of her friends in North Korea were enraged by not being able to dress the way they wanted.

""We are brainwashed by the North Korean government, so we still like the Supreme Leader, but the desire to look pretty is another issue,"" says Yang. ""The anger starts building up inside you, questioning why shouldn't I do it?""

Park, who works with a lot of newly arrived defectors in South Korea, foresees a bigger change that beauty can bring in North Korean society.

The activist explains that the government has become aware of the younger generation rebelling against state-approved culture. This is pushing them to adapt and to allow some degree of flexibility in order to maintain power.

""It basically forces the government to answer the question: Are they going to go with this change or are they just going to try and repress (it)?""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/23Py9o6miqQ/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE
['Kim Sajet'],"Written by Kim Sajet

Kim Sajet is the director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery and a contributor to "" The Obama Portraits ,"" co-published by the National Portrait Gallery and Princeton University Press. An exhibition featuring Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald's portraits of Barack Obama and Michelle Obama is set to tour the US from June 2021. The opinions expressed in this article belong to the author.

Each year, we take more than a trillion digital photos, many of which will be shared on social media. But instead of people feeling more connected to the world, researchers are observing signs of growing social isolation

Portraits, like real people, are demanding. They require not just face-to-face interaction, but deep contemplation of how the artists have brought their sitters to life.

I recently contributed an essay to a new book ""The Obama Portraits,"" which explores the impact -- and unprecedented popularity -- of Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald's portraits of former US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. An estimated 4 million people have flocked to the National Portrait Gallery, where I serve as director, to see the two artworks, essentially doubling the museum's attendance since they were unveiled in 2018

The question is why? Visitors know who the Obamas are, and what they look like. They've seen digital images of the portraits on their phones and laptops.

One online review of Wiley's portrait of Barack Obama offers one theory: ""The colors are stunning and aren't done justice in the digital photography I've seen in the media."" As the review suggests, you can't truly experience a portrait until you lift your head away from the device in your hand and look at the real thing. No matter how many reproductions you may have seen online, the original art is always far more profound in person.

That may be why millions have traveled to see the real thing -- and why millions more may do the same when the portraits go on a US-wide tour from next year. It may also be because museums serve as liminal spaces, where people can pause for reflection in the company of strangers. (Liminality, according to the French ethnographer Arnold van Gennep, is a ""betwixt and between"" moment of social or individual change.)

The Portrait Gallery, specifically, has provided a place for people to take a break from their often-harried lives and connect with two people they admire, either alone or in the company of others, before returning to the relentless pace of the ""real world.""

Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald

However, there is also, I believe, another force turning the museum into a meaningful place of social interaction, and that is technology -- or rather, the lack of it.

Ironically, for perhaps two of the most recognized people on the planet, it is paint not pixels, and conversations not cameras that make ""visiting"" Barack and Michelle Obama feel authentic. People often take selfies in front of the portraits as souvenirs of their visit, but I've noticed with interest how many of them then put away their devices and talk to each other.

Moreover, it is the shared experience of seeing the Obama portraits that is encouraging people to buck the trend described by James McWilliams in his article ""Saving the Self in the Age of the Selfie"" of shortened attention spans and ""phubbing,"" when a person glances at their phone while talking to someone else.

""A genuine self can't be in two places at once,"" he observed, noting that true friendships have a better chance of success when they begin in defined social spaces where a certain behavior requires your full attention.

In the case of the Obama portraits, visitors have to use both their head and their heart to make personal connections while taking account of their surroundings. For example, there are similarities between the portrait of Barack Obama and the seated compositions of other former US Presidents Abraham Lincoln, John Fitzgerald Kennedy and George W. Bush.

Yet, there are vast differences, like Wiley's fresh take on official portraiture by incorporating floral symbols that relate to the former president's life: chrysanthemums for Chicago, jasmine for Hawaii, African lilies for Kenya and roses for love. Reading the labels, or taking a guided tour with other people, is part of an interactive experience that transcends technology.

So too is standing in line. As the dedicated security personnel can attest, there is a real sense of camaraderie between visitors as they queue up to take their turn in front of the pictures. Groups debate, teachers teach, strangers overhear the comments of others and often chime in. It's the phenomenon of being connected and unplugged, offering emotional authenticity in a world of relentless feedback loops and ""tech anxiety,"" that is part of the draw. As the Harvard historian and noted author, Jill Lepore mentioned in an interview on the museum's ""Portraits"" podcast , people-watching is a pleasure when it comes to seeing visitors approach the portraits for the first time.

There was once a time when I used to beat myself up that the National Portrait Gallery wasn't as technologically advanced as its peers. We didn't have audio guides and are just now introducing a free app to offer multiple languages and support for the visually impaired, rather than as an essential in-gallery tool.

But now I realize, as I walk around the museum, that its lack of technologies might, in fact, be adding to the liminal experience, helping us set aside our ""digital selves"" in order to connect with our ""inner selves"" and commune with those around us.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/ky86L2bANek/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE

Catherine Opie is one of America's foremost photographers. Her work often focuses on visual identity and subcultures, including gay communities and non-binary gender expression. Her work challenges prevailing notions in these realms as the images and the language that follows shows. All opinions expressed in this article belong to the author. Click here for more Beauty stories.

Beauty is often thought of in relation to fashion and femininity. Its construct in pop culture is something that I've always tried to work with in different ways in relation to my work as a photographer. Beauty is complicated; it's an individual response to how we live our lives -- but it can also encompass kindness and compassion.

I don't think that real beauty is easily defined, otherwise it's cliched. I'm a self-identified butch dyke, I'm a big woman, and even though I might struggle with my body, I still find it really beautiful in terms of what it can do. Artists who challenge the idea that only a certain type of person or body can be valued are showing that what's considered ""the other"" can be beautiful too.

I find an enormous amount of beauty in being political and intellectual. Beauty isn't necessarily surface-level; it can also be about one's personal life and contain conflicting ideologies. You can create a certain aesthetic around those ideas, draw someone in with an element of beauty, and then push those boundaries by posing questions.

It's also important to make photographs that inspire one to really look, to be drawn in, instead of just glancing at something quickly. For me, beauty is also about being held.

I've experienced that captivating feeling in a series of three portraits taken by Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra in 1994. They feature three different women in the hospital, just after giving birth. They stand, nude, holding their newborns, and at times you see a trail of blood running down a leg, or the marking of a caesarean scar. I find beauty in the honesty of these images, and I'm moved by how they show a mother's protective nature.

People in my community were shocked when I became pregnant. It didn't seem like butch women like me birthed children.

But, I knew I always wanted to be a mom. When I gave birth to Oliver in 2002 , I took a self-portrait while nursing, recalling the forms of Madonna and child.

""Self-Portrait/Cutting"" (1993) Credit: Catherine Opie

""Self-Portrait/Nursing"" became the third in what could be considered a trilogy of photographs, with my earlier photographs ""Self-Portrait/Cutting"" and ""Self-Portrait/Pervert"" from the 1990s. The photograph with ""pervert"" cut into my chest, when I participated in Los Angeles's queer BDSM community, is a little too extreme for me now. It was important for me to make it, but there's some work that you don't necessarily want to live with every single day. I was talking about beauty in it, though, and the formality of a photograph. It engages you; it's very well-designed. For a large queer body to both hold space, and to seduce you, was a radical concept.

For me, it was perfect to complete this trilogy with the nursing image, which fulfilled my own longing to be a mother. I love the photograph because he was such a beautiful baby -- and he still is. At my last opening, Oliver sat on my lap and told me how proud he was of me as an artist. The fact that my 18-year-old son will still come and cuddle in my lap, mirroring the moment I photographed him while nursing, is incredibly touching to me.

I try to show that kind of vulnerability when photographing male beauty. In the 2000s, I took tender photographs of high school football players that show both their vulnerability as well as their performance of masculinity. Some of those images are hung now for the ""Masculinities"" show at the Barbican in London.

The show also includes images from ""Being and Having,"" which I hung in 1991, of my queer friends and I acting out exaggerated masculinity in moustaches and beards. The show included portraits of my longtime friend Pig Pen. Pig Pen is beautiful to me -- it's in their butchness, the way they hold their body. I'm drawn to the slippage of identity. We met in Los Angeles, running in the same circles, hanging out in queer clubs and being a part of grassroots organizations like Act Up and Queer Nation. The presence of our friendship, which spans decades and multiple bodies of work, is also really important to me. Sentimentality and nostalgia can also shape our perceptions of beauty.

Today I think we're getting around to understanding that it's also important to show people who are aging. There's something beautiful to that. I think about portraits of John Baldessari, David Hockney or Edith Windsor, all taken in their 80s, and what it means to kind of sit with somebody and photograph them when they're of that age. It's another way of talking about the beauty of longevity. Youth culture isn't the only important area to explore in beauty and fashion. It's important to represent the transitions of a person's body throughout their life.

We have to question the norm. And if we question the norm, then we question ideas that surround beauty. For me, beauty has to encompass more about the human condition and the times we are living in. I see just an enormous amount of hatred these days. It's troubling; I didn't think that we would return to this level of bigotry. In response, we have to figure out how to really support one another -- to treat people with decency. It's important to realize that beauty is actually tied to ideas around happiness. How do we become fulfilled in that way? And can we fulfill it through acts of kindness?",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/e-l7qZ0glHQ/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE

Say ""doomsday bunker"" and most people would imagine a concrete room filled with cots and canned goods.

The threat of global annihilation may feel as present as it did during the Cold War, but today's high-security shelters could not be more different from their 20th-century counterparts.

A number of companies around the world are meeting a growing demand for structures that protect from any risk, whether it's a global pandemic, an asteroid, or World War III -- while also delivering luxurious amenities.

""Your father or grandfather's bunker was not very comfortable,"" says Robert Vicino , a real estate entrepreneur and CEO of Vivos , a company he founded that builds and manages high-end shelters around the world.

""They were gray. They were metal, like a ship or something military. And the truth is mankind cannot survive long-term in such a Spartan, bleak environment.""

Doomsday demand

Many of the world's elite, including hedge fund managers, sports stars and tech executives (Bill Gates is rumored to have bunkers at all his properties) have chosen to design their own secret shelters to house their families and staff.

Gary Lynch, general manager of Texas-based Rising S Company , says 2016 sales for their custom high-end underground bunkers grew 700% compared to 2015, while overall sales have grown 300% since the November US presidential election alone.

The company's plate steel bunkers, which are designed to last for generations, can hold a minimum of one year's worth of food per resident and withstand earthquakes.

But while some want to bunker down alone, others prefer to ride out the apocalypse in a community setting that offers an experience a bit closer to the real world.

Developers of community shelters like these often acquire decommissioned military bunkers and missile silos built by the United States or Soviet governments -- sites that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build today.

The fortified structures are designed to withstand a nuclear strike and come equipped with power systems, water purification systems, blast valves, and Nuclear-Biological-Chemical (NBC) air filtration.

Most include food supplies for a year or more, and many have hydroponic gardens to supplement the rations. The developers also work to create well-rounded communities with a range of skills necessary for long-term survival, from doctors to teachers.

Vicino says Vivos received a flurry of interest in its shelters around the 2016 election from both liberals and conservatives, and completely sold out of spaces in its community shelters in the past few weeks.

Designer ark

One of those shelters, Vivos xPoint , is near the Black Hills of South Dakota, and consists of 575 military bunkers that served as an Army Munitions Depot until 1967.

Presently being converted into a facility that will accommodate about 5,000 people, the interiors of each bunker are outfitted by the owners at a cost of between $25,000 to $200,000 each. The price depends on whether they want a minimalist space or a home with high-end finishes.

The compound itself will be equipped with all the comforts of a small town, including a community theater, classrooms, hydroponic gardens, a medical clinic, a spa and a gym.

For clients looking for something further afield and more luxurious, the company also offers Vivos Europa One , billed as a ""modern day Noah's Ark"" in a former Cold War-era munitions storage facility in Germany.

The structure, which was carved out of solid bedrock, offers 34 private residences, each starting at 2,500 square feet, with the option to add a second story for a total of 5,000 square feet.

Stunning mural appears in secret forest

The units will be delivered empty and each owner will have the space renovated to suit their own tastes and needs, choosing from options that include screening rooms, private pools and gyms.

Vicino compares the individual spaces to underground yachts, and even recommends that owners commission the same builders and designers that worked on their actual vessels.

""Most of these people have high-end yachts, so they already have the relationship and they know the taste, fit, and finish that they want,"" he explains.

The vast complex includes a tram system to transport residents throughout the shelter, where they can visit its restaurants, theater, coffee shops, pool and game areas.

""We have all the comforts of home, but also the comforts that you expect when you leave your home,"" Vicino adds.

Nuclear hardened homes

Super-rich building luxury doomsday bunkers

""Our clients are sold on the unique advantage of having a luxury second home that also happens to be a nuclear hardened bunker,"" says Hall, who is already starting work on a second Survival Condo in another silo on site.

""This aspect allows our clients to invest in an appreciating asset as opposed to an expense.""

The Survival Condo has several different layouts, from a 900-square-foot half-floor residence to a two-level, 3,600-square-foot penthouse that starts at $4.5 million.

Owners have access to their homes and the facilities at anytime, whether a disaster is imminent or they just want to get away from it all, and the complex features a pool, general store, theater, bar and library.

The condo association sets the rules for the community, and during an emergency, owners would be required to work four hours a day.

Long-term luxury

If you prefer to spend the end of days solo, or at least with hand-selected family and friends, you may prefer to consider The Oppidum in the Czech Republic, which is being billed as ""the largest billionaire bunker in the world.""

The top-secret facility, once a joint project between the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), was built over 10 years beginning in 1984.

The site now includes both an above-ground estate and a 77,000-square-foot underground component. While the final product will be built out to the owner's specifications, the initial renderings include an underground garden, swimming pool, spa, cinema and wine vault.

While many might see the luxury amenities at these facilities as unnecessary, the developers argue that these features are critical to survival.

The supermodel even posted a video of her intense pre-flight ritual , which involved wiping down everything close to her airplane seat with Dettol anti-bacterial wipes, last year.

While the supermodel's precautionary outfit was given the seal of approval by many of her followers, others accused her of making light of the deadly outbreak, which has infected over a 100,000 people and killed over 4,000 across the world.

Campbell spoke of her techniques for avoiding germs while flying during a five-minute video shared on her YouTube channel last summer.

""Clean anything that you could possibly touch,"" she advised, before wiping her seat, seat belt, tray table, TV screen, remote control and window with anti-bacterial wipes.

""This is what I do on every plane I get on. I do not care what people think of me. It's my health and it makes me feel better.""

After putting on a sanitary face mask before take-off, Campbell went on to stress the rigorous routine has helped her to stay healthy during her lengthy modeling career, which has spanned three decades.

""I mean as much as I travel, I should get sick so much more with colds and stuff,"" she said.

""I'm blessed that I don't. I really think that this helps me, my little routine.""

"['Francesca Street', 'Yann-Guillaume Jaccard', 'Ceo', 'Co-Founder Of Swiss Private Jet Company Simply Jet Sa']","(CNN) — So your flight's canceled, but you need to get home or to that important business meeting ASAP. Perhaps you're just nervous about transiting through a busy airport with other passengers.

Most of us are handling coronavirus-related disruption by staying put, but for those in a travel predicament with dollars to burn, there's an increasingly popular alternative: private jets.

While much of the travel industry has been suffering as the infection spreads globally, the private jet industry has apparently been on a roll.

Alain Leboursier, director of sales at Swiss private jet broker Luna Jets, tells CNN Travel that there's been an ""impressive increase"" in bookings and enquiries from passengers in recent weeks, correlating with heightened concerns surrounding COVID-19.

In February, about 15% of overall requests were related to coronavirus, Leboursier says. That's now doubled to 30%.

""We got around 200 requests [on Sunday] Out of the 200 requests, 60 requests were coming from 'Coronavirus regions',"" adds Leboursier. ""Either people want to escape, or [there is] urgent business that needs to be done today or tomorrow.""

Clients include companies that normally book employees in biz class seats and high net worth individuals concerned about the spread of the virus.

On-demand private jet charter provider PrivateFly have noted an even bigger surge in demand since President Donald Trump announced restrictions on travel from the US to 26 European nations.

According to CEO Adam Twidell, the company are receiving a ""significant number of requests"" from Americans currently in Europe who are seeking to return to the US, as well as those keen to fly from Europe to the UK, which is exempt from the ban at present.

""Overall the inquiries we're getting are from people very concerned to get their families back together as soon as possible, given how rapidly the situation is developing,"" Twidell tells CNN.

""One client is flying her daughter home to the US from University in France, and several of her fellow students (who are also US citizens) are sharing the flight back with her.""

Leboursier says Luna Jet flew out a passenger over the weekend who usually divides her time between Rome and London. When Northern Italy announced unprecedented restrictions on Sunday, she chartered a flight to London right away. The following day, the lockdown was extended to cover the whole country.

Yann-Guillaume Jaccard, CEO and co-founder of Swiss private jet company Simply Jet SA, says he's currently inundated with inquiries regarding routes that have reduced commercial flights.

""Provided we find an aircraft and crew that is willing to do it [...] we do can do flights in and out of China with private jets,"" he says.

And it's not just European operators noticing an uptake. Jerod Davis, chief and managing pilot at US-based Southern Jet, says his aircraft are getting booked up far in advance.

Davis puts this down to a mix of ""common sense reasons and fear"" -- a lot of his clients are older, at higher risk of suffering ill effects if they contract coronavirus.

""They'd rather be on the plane by themselves, rather than with a crowd of people on airlines, and in security lines and all that,"" Davis tells CNN Travel.

US-based Paramount Business Jets echoes Davis. ""We are seeing anywhere from 100% to 300% increases in charter requests depending on the region worldwide,"" says CEO Richard Zaher.

""The requests are coming from private jet clients, government officials, entertainers and sports teams, corporate executives as well as people who normally would not fly private.""

Those travelers turning towards the private jet market do so for a range of reasons, with one common denominator: they're all able to spend thousands of dollars on the trip.

Operators say they're now servicing customers who would usually take business or first-class options.

""We are seeing a lot of requests from people who normally would not fly private,"" says Paramount Business Jets CEO Zaher.

Zaher gives the example of an older woman who was traveling from the east coast of the US to the west coast and discarded her commercial flight ticket in favor of a private jet.

Yann-Guillaume Jaccard, CEO and co-founder of Swiss private jet company Simply Jet SA “People basically are happy to pay a premium using our service versus commercial aviation to decrease the risk of contracting the virus.”

Another domestic US passenger was on oxygen and opted to travel private due to health concerns.

Twidell, of PrivateFly, says his company has also had requests from passengers keen to avoid exposure to crowded airport terminals or scores of passengers in airline cabins.

""These include a family looking to return home to Chicago, from New York where they have been attending a wedding,"" he says.

""The group includes an older passenger in their late 70s and a young child.

""Another group includes an immuno-compromised passenger, and they are returning home to the US from the Caribbean. In Europe, one flight was for a couple returning to Jersey in the Channel Islands, from Spain. They were keen to avoid making the necessary airline connection in London.""

Luna Jets, meanwhile, assisted a European passenger who canceled all his commercial tickets for the month of March, and decided to fly private instead. The Swiss company also operated several emergency flights out of Italy when the lockdown on the country's northern regions was announced Sunday.

""We're working on a flight for a company working on moving its 50 top employees from northern Italy back to London where they also have an office,"" says Leboursier.

Meanwhile, British private jet company Victor tells CNN Travel that a LA-based studio recently got in touch about arranging an emergency charter flight to transport 50 employees from Tokyo to LA.

Jaccard says some wealthy families from coronavirus ""hotspots"" have opted to relocate to another continent altogether, chartering private jets to up sticks from Europe to South America with the intention on ""staying there until the situation stabilizes.""

""That's a flight profile we don't see on a regular basis,"" says Jaccard. ""We were quite surprised to discover that some people are actually willing to just relocate themselves for an unknown period of time until you have more info and you know how it evolves.""

Private jet users seek solace in the fact that the aircraft's exactly that -- private. There's no battling for arm rests or ending up in close proximity to others. Plus, these flights operate out of small, private aviation terminals, not mass transport hubs.

""It's quite likely that you will be alone when you board your aircraft, you will only have contact with the security agents and the crew, and some airport personnel,"" says Jaccard.

""People basically are happy to pay a premium using our service versus commercial aviation to decrease the risk of contracting the virus.""

Fears aside, medical experts assure CNN Travel that passengers are unlikely to catch coronavirus on board a commercial airplane.

""Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, told CNN Travel last week , reiterating that hand washing is the best prevention.

""You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth,""

Still, for travelers concerned about hygiene -- the idea that private jet companies likely spend longer cleaning their aircraft is comforting.

Private jet companies also say that, like their commercial counterparts, they've stepped up the sanitization process.

""We always clean the airplane, it's a private jet so we always have it looking nice, but did we sanitize every single surface on the airplane before? Let's be honest, no. But now we do,"" says Davis.

Jaccard says Simply Jet SA has evaluated the cleaning products used -- and opted for ""medical grade"" options.

While private jet companies might be more willing to fly in and out of lockdown zones, the aircraft still operate within the same framework, rules and regulations as commercial airplanes.

Flying into a lockdown zone involves a safety assessment and submitting a flight plan to airport authorities, who will send it to health authorities, who pass on a list of requirements.

Air crew are given a full briefing on the route they're flying, the level of risk and the government stance on the destination.

Leboursier says Luna Jets ensures crew maintain good health by adopting a ""no overnights"" policy in lockdown regions and ensuring crew stay on board throughout their time on the ground.

PrivateFly's Twidell says crew members are having their temperatures checked before every flight.

Long-term impact

While private jet companies might be reaping the benefits of an unexpected boom, Davis says he can't help but have a ""weird feeling"" about getting more business because of a global health crisis.

""Obviously we don't want this to continue,"" he says. ""What we hope is this minimizes and goes away pretty quickly.""

Still, Davis acknowledges a long-term benefit could be that individuals who've opted for private jet travel during the crisis will be hooked, and continue to charter jets in the future.

""Once you fly private, you don't really want to go back,"" he says.

British company Victor points out that while there have been ""new requests for evacuation"", there have also been ""cancellations from those avoiding all travel.""

""It's too soon to know to what extent business aviation will be affected,"" says a Victor spokesperson.

The other players express fears that this short-term boom might simply be shielding long-term implications -- after all, if commercial air travel grounds to a halt, so too will private jet travel.

Plus, there's the economic consequences of a potential market downturn

""If everything is down 25% in a couple of months, that means that our clients may have to get rid of some personnel, they might need to close some factories, or they're just going to experience a general decrease in demand for their products over a long period of time,"" says Jaccard.

Luna Jets' Leboursier expresses similar concerns.

""In the long term, to be honest we are petrified -- because as the leader in Europe, if the market goes down, then we will be the most affected,"" he says.

Jaccard, of Simply Jet SA, says his company is also concerned about the future.

""We are always optimistic short term -- of course we are here to try and help where we can to provide alternate travel solutions that can replace all these routes that are not doable anymore,"" he says.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/5nK0QBSgEos/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE
['Tamara Hardingham-Gill'],"(CNN) — While there's no doubt that having your vacation interrupted by a fast-spreading virus that's infected more than 108,000 globally and killed over 3,800 is a major inconvenience, there are surely worse places to be confined than a luxury Maldives resort.

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

Lavish confinement

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

['Silvia Marchetti'],"(CNN) — His ship may have been to hell and back, becoming a floating coronavirus-infected prison for passengers quarantined at port in Japan, but when the captain of the Diamond Princess cruise ship became the last person aboard to finally step onto dry land, he looked entirely unruffled by the experience.

If it weren't for the mask on his face, Gennaro Arma, striding purposefully along the dockside in full uniform with hat under arm, might easily have been stepping down from an uneventful trip shuttling passengers from one vacation destination to another.

But those who know him best say the steadfast calm Arma exhibited throughout the ordeal in which more than 700 people on board the ship tested positive for COVID-19 was typical.

It's why, they say, the experienced Italian sailor is now being hailed as a hero at home and abroad.

""He emerged to be exactly how people have renamed him -- 'Fearless',"" Arma's wife, Mariana Gargiulo, tells CNN Travel from her home in Sant'Agnello, a beautiful coastal town south of Naples, where the captain is due to return soon.

""He never had any problems, and I never worried because we were constantly in contact.""

The quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess has been widely criticized for intensifying the risk of infection for those stuck aboard. Many passengers were eventually airlifted out, but not before at least five people had contracted fatal infections.

Nevertheless, Arma apparently proved himself a tireless rock for his passengers and crew during their ordeal and he's been widely praised for helping lift spirits and for setting a noble example of how a captain should deal with adversity.

'My gladiators'

His support for his crew was on display right to the end when he disembarked on March 2, having overseen the final transfer of all passengers either to hospital or a quarantine facility.

He called them ""my gladiators.""

Throughout the quarantine, he also regularly thanked all passengers on board for their patience and perseverance, leaving them notes of encouragement.

Back in Sant'Agnello his friends, family, townsfolk and local authorities are waiting for Arma's return, preparing to throw him a huge homecoming party. The captain tested negative for the virus and is currently in quarantine in Japan.

His wife says the captain's calm and control during the emergency made it easier for passengers to endure being confined to their cabins. It also gave his family a sense of peace and reassurance.

""We talked each day, both by phone and video chat,"" she says. ""I could hear he was calm, that everything was fine, and I could see that he was fine. He never had any problems.

""I could see him on the ship, he was doing well, working. We had the chance to talk a bit about everything, even our family, and not just about the situation on board.""

Arma, according to Gargiulo, is a real sea dog with decades of expertise that led him to travel around the world after he graduated at a prestigious local maritime school.

""He is a man with great sea skills and know-how,"" she adds. ""His main worry has always been the well-being of his passengers. It was a good test.""

As the wife of a cruise liner captain, Gargiulo has come to share and support her husband's job. She says she's ""always been very serene"" even during the past critical weeks.

""After many years, I'm used by now to the fact that he can be away, and far away, for a long period of time.""

Gargiulo says she doesn't know what Arma's next plans will be -- whether he'll take a break or not before heading back to sea. For now, she says she's just focused on seeing him again.

'A true diamond'

His employer, Princess Cruises, has already expressed its gratitude for its captain's efforts.

""Throughout the response efforts on Diamond Princess, Captain Arma was an exceptionally calm, capable, and inspirational leader for everyone on board,"" Princess Cruises president Jan Swartz said in a statement to CNN.

""From his regular daily shipboard updates to his tireless coordination with public health authorities, Princess shoreside operations, and his on-board team, Captain Arma's contributions have been hailed worldwide as a case study in outstanding leadership best practices.

""As he said to his self-proclaimed 'gladiators' onboard -- a diamond is a piece of coal that did really well under pressure, and I believe Captain Arma himself is a true diamond.""

Passengers too have praised Arma's steady leadership and the comfort he showed them through regular messages, updates and even gifts.

""Thank you to [Captain] Gennaro for his announcements and ability to find humor in an unusual circumstance,"" wrote one guest , Au Na Tan, on Twitter.

She added that Arma was ""courageous, sympathetic and carried himself with dignity and optimism for what was an unprecedented and unique situation. Through the entire journey, he sought to bring light to our circumstances and strove to reassure us as much as he could,"" because it's true that only ""a frightened captain makes a frightened crew .""

Arma's wife says his warm and friendly approach to guests is one of his many winning traits and part of his character.

'Symbol of Italy'

""He always takes good care of passengers, he's always had a particular attention for them,"" she says. ""Each day at lunchtime, before they'd start to eat, he wishes them all 'buon appetito' in Italian.

""And then there was the gesture of handing out flowers and chocolates on St. Valentine's Day to passengers shut in their cabins,"" to make them feel better and let them know they've not been abandoned, she says. ""It must have been really hard for them.""

Passengers were thankful for the Valentine gifts and food, posting photos online of what Arma's crew provided them with.

At one point, Arma recited a quote from the Bible to guests on the power of love, taken from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians, to lift spirits and send out a message of faith and resilience.

It's not just those who endured the drama on board who have praised the captain.

His actions have resonated worldwide, especially in Italy where many people have seen him as embodying Italian endurance and the spirit of sacrifice. They've turned to social media to express gratitude and feelings in phrases such as "" proud to be Italian . Grazie!""

Another admirer says he should be ""a mandatory case history for talkative, braggart and cowardly politicians.""

""There are captains and captains,"" reads another post that says Arma's actions would be worthy of inclusion in writer Rudyard Kipling's novel ""Captains Courageous.""

'Anti-Schettino'

Now a symbol of Italian pride, Arma has been described as "" the anti-Schettino .""

He's the ""best weapon ('arma' in Italian) against all the Schettinos in the world,"" said one tweet

Local Sorrento and Amalfi coast newsrooms have also been flooded with messages from Arma's new fans.

One of them wrote how the captain's efforts make him worthy of ""the same sea waters roamed by Odysseus, Aeneas, Christopher Columbus"" and other great seafarers and mythological heroes.

Matching heroism with humility, Arma's final message to his crew stressed that it was teamwork that pulled them all through.

""We are all on the final leg of our journey,"" he wrote. ""Stay strong, look after yourselves. We will finish as we started: together.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/QwZYmjfEvH0/index.html,CNN,World,TRUE
"['Francesca Street', 'Andrew Zimbalist', 'Robert A. Woods Professor Of Economics At Smith College', 'Christophe Dubi', 'Executive Director', 'International Olympic Committee']","(CNN) — At the forefront of the photo, a diver leaps into azure Spanish skies, arching her body into a streamlined curve.

In the background, a panoramic Barcelona skyline stretches out, punctuated by La Sagrada Familia, Gaudi's half-finished masterpiece of a cathedral, and fringed by distant hills.

This incredible shot was first captured by British photographer Bob Martin in the lead up to the 1992 Summer Olympic Games, and matched later by photographer Simon Bruty, for Getty Images, in the lead gallery picture above.

Over the course of the Olympics' two-week stint in Barcelona, variations on this eye-catching scene were broadcast on television screens around the world, cementing a spectacular image of the Spanish city in the memories of millions.

The result? Barcelona arrived squarely on the tourism map, transforming from an undiscovered gem to a must-visit European destination: in 1990, there were just 1.7 million overnight visitors, by 2016, there were over 8 million.

Sure, during that time the Spanish city also benefited from the growth of budget flights, a booming cruise industry and increasing word of mouth reports of its many cultural highlights -- but many reckon the successful Olympic stint is what kickstarted the uptake.

But while tourists still flock to Barcelona's Montjuïc area to see the view that the Olympics made famous, across the Mediterranean in Greece, many of the venues that were once the glory of Athens 2004 lie seemingly semi-abandoned and forgotten.

They're not alone: In China, some of Beijing's 2008 Olympic venues have been absorbed by nature, weeds growing inside what was once the BMX track.

With a new Olympic city in the spotlight every couple of years, the short-term tourism opportunity and long-term tourism legacy promised by hosting the Games is alluring.

But the threat of populating your city with ""white elephant"" venues that serve no purpose post-Games is increasingly disconcerting. Early this year, concerns were raised about the safety of Rio's 2016 Olympics Park, with a judge even ordering its closure

So why do Olympic venues sometimes get abandoned? And how do cities ensure a positive Olympic legacy for both tourists and locals?

Building an Olympic city

The Summer Olympics are one of the world's biggest sporting events, and, unsurprisingly, building an Olympic city is no easy feat.

It all starts with a would-be host submitting a bid, outlining how they intend to get their Games off the ground, and how they'll transform their city into a sporting playground.

""These days you need somewhere between 35 and 40 athletic venues to just host the required games for the Olympics,"" explains Andrew Zimbalist, Robert A. Woods professor of economics at Smith College in Massachusetts, and the author of several studies on the economics of the Olympic Games.

Some of the Olympic venues from Athens 2004 have not fared well. Milos Bicanski/Getty Images

""On top of that, you need an Olympic village that will house somewhere in the neighborhood of 18,000 people, you need a media village that also requires beds for several thousand people.""

In short, it takes a lot of space and a lot of venues.

In that sense, says Zimbalist, a city getting saddled with white elephants post-Olympics is perhaps more likely than not.

""Ask yourself the question, if a city did not have a economically justifiable reason to have a facility the day before the Olympics began, why would they have an economically justifiable reason to have the facility 18 days later, after the Olympics ends, or after the Paralympics, a month and a half later, ends?"" the economist tells CNN Travel.

In recent years, bidding cities have tried to circumnavigate this issue by planning ahead, devising ways to successfully transform into an Olympic city, and successfully transform back again, whether via temporary venues, or converting pre-existing apparatus.

This isn't just cities being inventive -- nowadays it's pretty much mandated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), who oversee the Games and the bidding process.

In 2013, the IOC adopted its Olympic Agenda 2020 reform program, seeking to make the games more sustainable and to ""keep up with the changes in our current world."" The new program stipulates that the venues do not need to be permanent, or new, and costs do not need to be astronomical.

""Image building is extremely powerful,"" says Christophe Dubi, executive director of the IOC. ""But you need a plan. That's what we gauge now, in the dialogue [with host cities.]""

Making the bid

Why a destination bids to host an Olympics Games is dependent upon its individual economic, social, cultural and historical factors.

""Cities bid for the Olympics for geopolitics reasons, for media branding reasons, for sponsorship, to track foreign direct investment and talent and so on,"" says Tony Johnston, head of Tourism at Althone Institute of Technology in Ireland.

While tourism might not be the motivating factor for bidding, hosting a mega event puts your city on show, on a global scale. And such high stakes have, for a long while, come hand-in-hand with high prices.

Take the Canadian city of Montreal, which hosted the Summer Olympics in 1976, and reportedly only stopped paying off its Olympic debt three decades later . Or Sochi, in Russia, which took on the 2014 Winter Olympics amid plans to spend upwards of an eye-watering $50 billion.

Andrew Zimbalist, Robert A. Woods professor of economics at Smith College “If a city did not have a economically justifiable reason to have a facility the day before the Olympics began, why would they have an economically justifiable reason to have the facility 18 days later, after the Olympics ends?”

Some city populations have expressed concerns about the mounting costs. Boston, in the US, and Hamburg, in Germany, withdrew their respective bids for the 2024 games. Boston made the decision after polls indicated a lack of support, while Hamburg pulled out of its bid following a citywide referendum in which 51.6% of residents said they were against the idea.

""We are encouraging the organizing committees to find solutions that are cheaper if they do exist,"" Dubi tells CNN Travel. ""And we really embrace that spirit of creativity, innovation in order to contain the costs.""

Dubi says he's confident prices are becoming more restrained.

He also adds that the importance of planning for legacy is true of any major sporting event.

""We are permanently dialoguing with future hosts for 2030, 32, 34 etc,"" adds Dubi. ""What is your long term plan in terms of development for the city and the region? And how can the Games contribute? You have to have a strong plan and the Games as a contributor to make it a success.""

London as a case study

In 2012, right before the Olympic Agenda 2020 was adopted, London hosted the Summer Olympic Games. This Olympic stint didn't offer Barcelona levels of tourism transformation -- perhaps because, as economics and environmental studies expert Victor A. Matheson jokingly put it: ""The Olympics aren't going to put London on the map because if London isn't already on your map, you really need to get yourself a new map.""

But London's Games did try and prepare for a post-Olympics future. How successfully the city did so depends on who you ask.

The London Legacy Development Corporation was formed a couple months before the 2012 Olympics, with the aim of using ""the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of the London 2012 Games and the creation of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to develop a dynamic new heart for east London, creating opportunities for local people and driving innovation and growth in London and the UK.""

Peter Tudor, the corporation's director of visitor services, recently showed CNN Travel around the London Aquatics Centre, the swanky water palace purpose-built for the London Olympics' swimming, diving and synchronized swimming events.

It's been a public pool since 2014. On a rainy winter weekday, it was teeming with activity -- from school kids crowding the entryways to serious swimmers doing laps beneath the undulating roof.

""The London Olympics was probably one of the first times people were really thinking about what happens after the Games, lots of cities got to the end of their Games and then asked the question,"" says Tudor.

The Aquatics Centre cost £269 million to build, and underwent a lengthy, pricey, transformation process to become a public space.

It still hosts official events from time to time: the FINA Diving World Series is scheduled to take place here in March 2020, followed shortly after by the British Swimming Championships.

But for some east Londoners, it's just their local gym -- even if UK Olympian Tom Daley can occasionally be seen catapulting off the diving board.

London's Olympic Park is based in Stratford, in the east of the city, a historically poorer, industrial area. Part of the London Olympic bid was a promise to regenerate this part of the British capital.

The city's then-mayor, Ken Livingstone, said the Olympics was ""the only way to get the billions of pounds out of the government to develop the East End -- to clean the soil, put in the infrastructure and build the housing.""

There's certainly been a lot of housing built here, pre and post-2012. There's still more development to come as part of the still-in-the-works East Bank development , including planned east London offshoots of the Victoria and Albert Museum and Sadlers Wells Theatre.

Additionally, in the post-Olympic years, London's stadium has become a soccer hub for London football team West Ham United. The ArcelorMittal Orbit tower -- a piece of public art designed to symbolize the triumph of the Olympics -- doubles up as a slide and viewing platform.

Still, this transformation didn't come cheap. The London Stadium was originally pitched at £280 million ($358 million at today's exchange rates) -- its final construction cost was £486 million, and converting it into a venue suitable for West Ham cost an additional £272 million.

And naysayers question whether there was a need for a super fancy helter-skelter, or huge new stadium. Plus, they say, the East End area of the city had been pegged for regeneration whether or not the Olympics came to town.

""If the [British] government had simply provided incentives to encourage that development, then you would have would have gotten much more authentic and organic and deep economic development in that area then anything that you might have gotten from the Olympic construction,"" says economist Zimbalist.

Londoner Julian Cheyne used to live in a housing estate called Clays Lane, knocked down in 2007 to make way for the Olympic Park. Cheyne is the co-founder of a site called GamesMonitor, that views the Olympic project through a critical lens.

""If you are a part of the property industry, then you can make a lot of money out of projects associated with the Olympics,"" Cheyne tells CNN Travel. ""And it means that you get the opportunity to remove people from areas of land which you might have your eye on.""

Cheyne was rehoused and received monetary compensation, but he says he had ""no desire to move.""

He is, in fact, skeptical that the Olympics have any sort of positive impact on tourism.

""It's very difficult to think of any particular benefits that London has had as a result of the Olympics. It was a well known city. It didn't need this boost in order to get tourists to come to it.""

""I'm not really a fan of the Olympics at all, I don't think that these major events contribute anything to the cities, apart from a degree of destruction to largely poor neighborhoods,"" says Cheyne.

The London Legacy Corporation, however, argues the city's Olympics, and ongoing legacy has largely boosted the lives of locals and tourists.

Peter Tudor points to a series of recent high profile sporting events as one example: in 2019, the London Stadium played host to two Major League Baseball (MLB) games between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The matches were part of a two year arrangement for MLB to play season matches at the city's stadium -- this year will see the St. Louis Cardinals take on the Chicago Cubs.

The 2019 series added a reported nearly £37 million ($48.1 million) to the London economy . Fifteen percent of the fans who attended were from the United States, 10% were international tourists from elsewhere. Meanwhile, 65% of attendees traveled from other places in the UK.

The IOC, says Tudor, likes to recommend prospective bidders come and visit the London venues -- to see how legacy building is done.

""We show other nations delegations round on a fairly frequent basis,"" he explains.

Unexpected tourism

When it comes to an Olympic tourism uptake, almost three decades after divers were filmed catapulting through Barcelona's skyline, the Spanish city's still most often held up as an example of the Olympics' power to transform a city's tourism fortunes for the better.

It's not the only one, though. Turin, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006, also saw a boost: Visitor numbers in Piedmont increased from 3.3 million in 2006 to 4.3 million in 2012.

Another Winter Olympics success story is Salt Lake City, Utah, which hosted in 2002.

Utah, once second-fiddle to Colorado as a ski destination, had its profile raised thanks to the Olympics, explains economist Victor Matheson. The exposure led to an increase in the number of skier visits in Salt Lake City (and surrounding area), and more rapid growth than neighboring Colorado, Matheson says.

These success stories might have staying power in the public consciousness, but so too do the abandoned venues; stories on these spots make headlines, populate Instagram and Flickr and inspire think pieces.

While on paper abandoned Olympic infrastructure might seem like a waste, a failure to capitalize on Olympic legacy, oddly, such venues can become a tourist attraction of their own -- albeit a niche, and possibly even illegal-to-visit one.

The popularity of ""ruin porn"" -- artsy photographs of abandoned venues -- can send photographers flocking to the graffiti-strewn bobsled tracks of Sarajevo, or Athens' disused venues.

The IOC, meanwhile, is keen to stress that the venues which appear abandoned sometimes have more to them than meets the eye.

""We are conscious that some venues from past Games are not utilized as fully as they could be,"" says Bernardo Domingues, media relations manager at the IOC.

""However, too often we see outdated or out of context reports or images of venues from past Games that do not represent the current situation or account for the full picture.""

Christophe Dubi, executive director, International Olympic Committee “The one message that I really insist upon is that we have turned the page, Games bidding and Games organization has been really totally revamped”

The IOC points to Beijing's often-photographed BMX track, saying it was always intended as a temporary facility, and photos of the cities Canoeing and Rowing Park, which it says do not demonstrate the facility's full use.

In Rio, the issue, says Dubi, is that temporary venues haven't been dismantled.

Domingues says the IOC is currently conducting a research study looking at the post-Games use of all existing Olympic venues, with results due in early 2021.

Not everything's been perfect in the past, the organization admits, and it says it's learning from this -- pointing to the new Olympic Agenda 2020 reform program.

""The one message that I really insist upon is that we have turned the page. Games bidding and Games organization has been really totally revamped,"" says Dubi.

Olympic future

The mission of the modern Olympic Games is to build bridges between countries and celebrate connections -- and offer a stellar fortnight of sporting greatness.

This mission is predicated on the idea that the Olympics sets up shop in a different city every couple of years, opening the world's eyes to the wonders of that particular destination.

Still, some experts suggest that to eradicate fears of disused venues, and as a way of addressing the increasingly fervent question of sustainability, the IOC should abandon the bidding system altogether.

The proposed alternative? A few cities alternate hosting duties at purpose-built, permanent venues. Andrew Zimbalist calls this concept, ""the only sensible plan,"" while Matheson, while admitting that it's not 100% in the spirit of the Olympics, says he would ""vote in favor of that -- and in a heartbeat.""

The IOC, however, is more interested in an alternative idea that's already being put into practice: giving the Olympic Games a larger footprint -- that is, a region, or even entire country hosting, rather than one city.

The 2026 Winter Olympics, for example, is due to be hosted by Italian cities Milan and Cortina.

And while Tokyo's initial plan for 2020 was to construct new venues on the islands surrounding Tokyo Bay, this idea was rejigged to instead reuse venues from the Games in 1964, build temporary structures that will be dismantled post-Games, and utilize existing structures further afield.

There are 12 venues that are located over five miles from the Olympic village HQ.

This plan comes with an added tourism bonus, as more of the country will be spotlighted.

['Patrick Gillespie'],"Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn.

Mexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today. And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States.

It's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country.

""I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina,"" Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City.

He added: It's a ""good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes.""

American corn goes into a lot of the country's food. In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere.

Related: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us

America is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn. American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada.

American farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data. In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million.

Experts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers.

""If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy,"" says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm.

Rios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats. Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%.

Trump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA. He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true.

Still, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like.

All sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period.

But Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA.

Such tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter. He's not alone. Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond ""immediately"" to any tariffs from Trump.

""It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,"" Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show.

"['Rishi Iyengar', 'Kristie Lu Stout']","America is great because of its willingness to accept talented immigrants.

That's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity.

""If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent,"" Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.

Infosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas. The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs.

The Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform.

Curbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest.

India is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry. According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians.

Shares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown.

India's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized. The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India.

But Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's ""America First"" plan. If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India.

""This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season,"" he said. ""It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here.""

Nilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example.

As a result of the initiative, the vast majority of India's 1.3 billion citizens now have a biometric ID number that allows them to receive government services, execute bank transactions and even make biometric payments.

['Alanna Petroff'],"Voters in Switzerland have shocked the political establishment by rejecting a reform plan that would have brought the country's corporate tax system in line with international norms.

The tax reforms, which were widely supported by the business community, would have removed a set of special low-tax privileges that had encouraged many multinational companies to set up shop in Switzerland.

Experts say the future of Switzerland's tax system is now unclear. The vote result could create headaches for firms that had been banking on their implementation, and deter companies who had been considering a move to the country.

""They do not know what [tax] measures will be available... That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions,"" Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement.

Switzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system. The country runs the risk of being ""blacklisted"" by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019.

Many voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland. That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class.

The current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations. International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies.

Martin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms. The measures were rejected by 59% of voters.

['Paul R. La Monica'],"The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 each hit new all-time highs Monday.

Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will continue to thrive.

So is this the Donald Trump rally? Or the Janet Yellen rally?

Some strategists believe Trump's stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring.

Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead?

You could argue that POTUS 44 has dealt POTUS 45 a pretty good hand.

The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident.

But investors (and financial journalists) are often quick to give the president more credit -- and blame -- than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market.

RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday, one that was aptly titled ""Message to Market: It's Not All About Donald.""

Related: Trump isn't killing the bull market

Golub noted that the S&P 500 rose nearly 7% from late June through Election Day -- a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president.

But stocks have continued to rally since then, rising another 8% since Trump pulled off the upset (at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street) victory.

You can't have it both ways. It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didn't lose.

Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won, a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress.

Yet Golub points out that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was going up during the late summer as well.

Of course, many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too.

Yet once again, many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected, but was happening because many thought he would lose.

Related: Stocks have avoided a 1% dive for an unusually long period of time

So it's odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win.

What's really going on? The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve.

Yes. the markets are reacting to Washington. But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen, not the White House.

The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in 2017 regardless of who won the race for president.

The good news for investors is that the U.S. economy seems to be growing steadily, but does not appear to be at risk of overheating.

Related: Here's why the world's largest money manager is worried

The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of 2.5% annually. But that's not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates.

Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year, they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time. That would push the Fed's key short-term rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%.

That's still extremely low. At those levels, stocks would still be more attractive than bonds. Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip. And consumers would probably keep spending.

So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president,

With that in mind, Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. And what she says about the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes could wind up keeping the rally going full steam ahead -- or stopping it dead in its tracks.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/WuHmoPyNDKc/index.html,CNN,International Market,TRUE

The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL) to a $700 billion market cap, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone.

Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.

['Patrick Gillespie'],"America and Canada have one of the world's biggest trade relationships.

President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada,"" Trump said at the news conference.

But the U.S.-Canada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think. There have been trade wars, acts of retaliation, allegations of dumping and jobs lost.

""Our trading relationship obviously is strong...but the relationship has been rocky, despite the agreements we have in place,"" says Stuart Trew, an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa, Canada's capital.

Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA, the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. But Canada is rarely mentioned.

Yet, there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada -- almost all by U.S. companies -- than against Mexico. Even today, Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat.

Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive. But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way.

Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau.

1. Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico

Listening to Trump, you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA. But since NAFTA's inception in 1994, there have been 39 complaints brought against Canada, almost all by U.S. companies. Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements, it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico, Canada, or the U.S.

There's only been 23 complaints against Mexico. (By comparison, companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of 21 complaints against the U.S.)

And increasingly, Canada is the target of American complaints. Since 2005, Canada has been hit with 70% of the NAFTA dispute claims, according to CCPA, a Canadian research firm.

2. The U.S. - Canada lumber battle

NAFTA isn't the only sore area. In 2002, the U.S. slapped a roughly 30% tariff on Canadian lumber, alleging that Canada was ""dumping"" its wood on the U.S. market. Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies 30,000 jobs.

""It was a very sour point in Canadian - American relations for quite a while,"" says Tom Velk, an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The dispute had its origins in the 1980s, when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts weren't playing fair.

Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute.

Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada. American lumber companies still allege that it does, and a U.S. Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in 2004. It didn't say whether the subsidies were ongoing.

According to the allegations, Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from. That subsidy -- on top of Canada's huge lumber supply -- allowed Canada to price its lumber below what U.S. companies can charge.

The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada, denying America's claim and the two sides came to an agreement in 2006 to end the tariff.

However, that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October, and the two sides are back at it again. The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldn't reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with U.S. lumber companies calling once again for tariffs.

3. Smoot-Hawley triggers U.S. - Canada trade war

Things got even worse during the Great Depression. In 1930, Congress wanted to protect U.S. jobs from global trade. So the U.S. slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers.

It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act. Today, it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was.

Canada was furious, and retaliated more than any other country against the U.S., sparking a trade war.

""Canada was so incensed that...they raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new U.S. tariff,"" according to Doug Irwin, a Dartmouth Professor and author of ""Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.""

For example, the U.S. increased a tariff on eggs from 8 cents to 10 cents (these are 1930s prices, after all). Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from 3 cents to 10 cents -- a threefold increase.

Exports dwindled sharply: in 1929, the U.S. exported nearly 920,000 eggs to Canada. Three years later, it only shipped about 14,000 eggs, according to Irwin.

Related: Remember Smoot-Hawley: America's last major trade war

4. Canada's sky high tariffs on U.S. eggs, poultry, milk

Fast forward to today. Smoot-Hawley is long gone, but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on U.S. imports of eggs, chicken and milk.

For instance, some tariffs on eggs are as high as 238% per dozen, according to Canada's Agriculture Department. Some milk imports, depending on the fat content, are as high as 292%.

""They're so onerous that you can't bring it across. There's no American eggs in Quebec,"" says Velk.

According to Canada's Embassy in the U.S., reality is much different. Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs, Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk, poultry and eggs.

The U.S. does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries, but they are not nearly as high as Canada's.

Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some U.S. dairy and poultry farmers, some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market. But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now.

Related: Those Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about

5. COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA

Despite all these disputes, experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world.

In fact, the two countries are so interconnected now, when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against U.S. lawmakers.

For example, Canadian meat producers disputed a U.S. law that required them to label where the cattle was born, raised and slaughtered. Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the U.S. and took the case to the WTO.

The WTO sided with Canada, and last December, Congress repealed the country-of-origin-labeling law. American meat producers -- whose business is intertwined with Canada -- actually supported their counterparts in Canada, arguing the regulation was too burdensome.

As for Trump's proposal of tearing up NAFTA, many American and Canadian experts say that it's not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement. The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth.

AT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms. Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service.

Related: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans

And AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX). Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings.

But the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years.

Yahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year. It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter.

However, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it ""continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches"" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon.

Verizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous. In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications. And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX).

There also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR).

That may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now. But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days.

Anything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible.

Related: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover

Still, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%. And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends.

Companies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected. Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt.

That's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too. That could push bond yields even higher.

So Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year.

['Ivana Kottasova'],"It's a good day for OPEC.

Data published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production.

The confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016.

The price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions.

Since then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel.

Here's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher:

OPEC deal

OPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices.

The news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%.

Investors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply.

Crucially, the deal has stuck. The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production. The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%.

UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected.

The production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months.

Related: OPEC has pulled off one of its 'deepest' production cuts

Investors upbeat

The OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it. The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC.

The widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases.

Higher demand

The latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year.

Demand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016.

The IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017.

Saudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale

What's next?

Despite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher.

That's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market. The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes. That's 152 more than a year ago.

U.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report.

""This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output,"" said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index.

""They have a very cookie-cutter approach in terms of what the model is and how [to] force feed it into any geography,"" Pranay Jivrajka, a top executive at Ola Cabs, said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.

Jivrajka, who until recently served as Ola's COO, said that Uber should ditch its one-size-fits-all approach and instead try to understand ""local nuances"" that would help it to identify services that ""users and drivers actually want.""

Uber declined to comment on Jivrajka's remarks.

Uber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers. The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia.

The San Francisco-based company suspended its operations in Taiwan last week, six months after it sold its operations in China to local rival Didi Chuxing. Didi, which is taking the fight to Uber in key foreign markets, is one of Ola's investors.

In India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival. Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities.

Ola also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015.

""What has helped us is having an ear to the ground in terms of understanding what the users want,"" said Jivrajka.

India isn't always a straightforward market for either company -- tens of thousands of drivers representing both Uber and Ola went on strike in Delhi this week, demanding better pay and benefits. The Delhi government has offered to mediate the dispute.

Jivrajka did not comment on the protests, but said that Ola's main focus remains bringing more drivers onto its platform.

The term ""fake news"" was originally coined to describe online stories that are designed to deceive readers.

Sears Holdings, the company that owns retail stores Sears and Kmart, reportedly said this weekend that it would remove 31 Trump-branded items from its website.

The company pulled the products as part of a plan to focus on its ""most profitable items,"" Sears spokesman Brian Hanover told Reuters.

Hanover told the news organization that items in the Trump Home line of furnishings were removed from the company's website, although they could still be purchased through third-party vendors online. Neither store carried the items in their physical stores, he said.

Searches of the Sears and KMart websites did not turn up Trump Home products, except for those sold by third-party vendors.

In a statement Monday, spokesman Chris Brathwaite distanced Sears from any political controversy and reiterated that many Trump-branded products are still available through third-party sellers.

""In this case, certain products were removed from our websites that included a very small number of Trump products,"" he said. ""The headlines do not do justice to our business or this specific brand of products that we offer through our marketplace sellers.""

Brathwaite added that the company prefers to focus on its business and ""leave the politics to others.""

Online sales of Ivanka's brand had surged in late 2015, and last month's numbers appear to be more of a ""return to reality,"" according to Taylor Stanton, Slice's marketing and communications manager. The brand's dip in performance was abnormal in light of an uptick in 2016 online sales in the apparel and accessories category, said Jack Beckwythe, a Slice analyst.

After growing rapidly in recent decades, Thailand has become one of Asia's biggest economies. But like many other countries in the region, it's been slow to try to combat the millions of tons of trash produced each year.

['Charles Riley'],"How's this for déjà vu? Another debt crisis is brewing in Europe.

Greece needs European creditors to release cash from a bailout agreed in 2015 so it can make debt repayments, but officials are at loggerheads. Investors are starting to worry, demanding higher returns on Greek debt.

Adding to the confusion is a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Greece's debt is unsustainable and on an ""explosive"" path, an assessment that prevents the fund from participating in a rescue.

The timing could hardly be worse. European leaders have a lot on their plate. Elections are looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany. Brexit negotiations will begin within weeks.

Yet the threat of Greece tumbling out of the euro demands attention. Here's why the next few weeks will be key:

Hammer to fall

Greece is running out of cash, but it needs to make repayments to creditors including the European Central Bank. Major bills are coming due in July.

If Greece cannot make the payments, it will default on its debt and spiral out of the eurozone.

Meanwhile, its latest bailout -- the third since 2010 -- is effectively frozen. The negotiating positions of major players are further apart than at any point since the bailout was agreed in June, 2015.

There is even disagreement over the size of the problem facing Greece.

""The IMF's latest review of Greece's debt position was surprisingly pessimistic,"" said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs meetings of top eurozone finance officials. ""It's surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes.""

I want it all

The IMF, Greece and creditors led by Germany all have very different priorities. Here's what each wants:

The IMF has called on Greece to make more ambitious changes to its economy, including labor market reforms. The IMF didn't join the third bailout when first agreed in 2015 because it did not view Greece's debt as being sustainable. It still maintains that Greece cannot be self sustaining without major debt relief.

Greece's main creditors agree that Athens should implement the reforms proposed by the IMF. However, they have categorically ruled out any debt relief, a position reiterated by eurozone finance officials on Tuesday.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, meanwhile, shows no sign of yielding to demands for additional reforms. He insists that debt relief is needed before any new concessions are made.

It's a classic standoff and investors are watching to see which party blinks first.

Put out the fire

The next major milestone is a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Feb. 20 -- the last before elections start muddying Europe's political waters. Agreeing yet more financial aid for Greece will become even harder once voters start casting their ballots.

After that, bills will start coming due. Greece faces a payment to the ECB of roughly €1.4 billion in late April and another €4.1 billion in July.

The stake are high.

The unemployment rate in Greece is expected to run above 21% in 2017. Investment is down by more than 60% and output has contracted by more than 25% since the financial crisis. The country's social fabric is fraying.

If European creditors refuse further help, Greece's debt will spiral out of control no matter how quickly its economy grows, according to the IMF.

That will leave only one option -- abandoning the euro.

Ted Malloch, President Trump's expected choice for U.S. ambassador to the EU, told Greek television on Tuesday that the eurozone's future would be decided in the next 18 months.

""Certainly there will be a Europe, whether the eurozone survives, I think it's very much a question that is on the agenda,"" he said. ""I think this time I would have to say that the odds are higher that Greece itself will break out of the euro.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/ekWVwX2Av0k/index.html,CNN,International Market,TRUE

""They may no longer want to practice in the United States."" The action is currently in legal limbo after a federal appeals court temporarily halted the ban.

Over the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 visa waiver has funneled 15,000 foreign physicians into underserved communities.

Sanford Health has 75 physicians in total on these visa waivers and seven are from the countries listed in the executive order. ""If we lost Dr. Al Nofal and our other J-1 physicians, we would be unable to fill critical gaps in access to health care for rural families,"" said Sanford Health's Morrison.

And the ban could hurt the pipeline of new doctors, too. The Conrad 30 visa waiver program is fed by medical school graduates holding J-1 non-immigrant visas who have completed their residencies in the U.S.

More than 6,000 medical trainees from foreign countries enroll every year in U.S. residency programs through J-1 visas. About 1,000 of these trainees are from countries caught up in the ban, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges. J-1 visa holders who were out of the country when the ban went into effect were prohibited from entering the U.S. and unable to start or finish school as long as the ban is in place.

The State Department told CNNMoney that the government may issue J-1 visas to people who are from one of the blocked countries if it is of ""national interest,"" but would not confirm whether a doctor shortage would qualify for such consideration.

""The stress and concern generated by the short-term executive order could have long-term implications, with fewer physicians choosing training programs in the states and subsequently magnifying the deficit in providers willing to practice in underserved and rural areas,"" said Dr. Larry Dial, vice dean for clinical affairs at Marshall University's school of medicine in Huntington, West Virginia.

Al Nofal went to medical school in Damascus, Syria's capital, and completed his residency at the University of Texas on a J-1 visa. He proceeded to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic and then applied for a J-1 waiver, which placed him in Sioux Falls.

Nineteen months into his three-year commitment, Al Nofal is either directly treating or serving as a consulting physician to more than 400 pediatric patients a month on average.

He sees most of his patients at the Sanford Children's Specialty Clinic in Sioux Falls, where families often drive hours for an appointment. Once a month, he flies in a small plane to see patients in a clinic in Aberdeen, about 200 miles away.

""It's not easy being a doctor in this setting,"" said Al Nofal, citing the long hours and South Dakota's famously frigid winters. ""But as a physician, I'm trained to help people whatever the circumstances and I'm proud of it.""

It's one of the reasons why Al Nofal and his American wife Alyssa have struggled to come to terms with the visa ban.

""I have a 10-month old baby and I can't travel to Syria now. My family in Syria can't come here,"" he said. ""Now my family can't meet their first grandson.""

""I know if we leave I probably can never come back,"" he said. Neither does he want to travel anywhere in the country right now. ""I'm afraid of how I will be treated,"" he said. He's also afraid he will be stopped at the airport -- even if he's traveling to another state.

Almatmed Abdelsalam, who's from Benghazi, Libya, had planned to start practicing as a family physician in Macon, Georgia, through the visa waiver program after he completed his residency at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine in July.

Everything was going smoothly. Abdelsalam, who treats hospital patients and veterans, applied for the visa waiver and was accepted. He signed an employment contract with Magna Care, which provides physicians to three hospitals in the Macon area and he had started looking at houses to relocate himself, his wife and their two young kids over the summer.

But there was one last step. For his J-1 waiver application to be fully completed, it needs to get final approval from the State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

""The executive order came in the middle of that process, stalling my application at the State Department,"" he said.

Because he's a Libyan citizen (Libya is also subject to the visa ban), Abdelsalam is fearful of the outcome.

""The hospital in Macon urgently needs doctors. Even though they've hired me, I'm not sure how long they can wait for me,"" he said.

""No one can argue it's necessary to keep the country safe, but we should also keep the country healthy,"" he said. ""Doctors like me, trained in the U.S. at some of the best schools, are an asset not a liability.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/APmtKOVXWy8/index.html,CNN,International Market,TRUE
['Paul R. La Monica'],"More and more business leaders and Wall Street strategists are expressing their worries about what President Donald Trump's protectionist policies and unpredictable nature might do to the markets and economy.

But we all know that action speaks louder than words. What investors are actually doing is in stark contrast to what people are saying. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs again on Friday.

And the Russell 2000, an index of small company stocks that tend to do most of their business in the U.S., is now just a few points away from the all-time high it hit last December in the wake of Trump market euphoria.

What's more, the VIX (VIX), a measure of volatility known as Wall Street's fear gauge, is down nearly 25% this year as well. If investors were really scared of Trump, the VIX should be much higher.

And CNNMoney's own Fear & Greed Index, which looks at the VIX and six other measures of investor sentiment, is showing signs of Greed and is not far from Extreme Greed levels.

Of course, Trump still can't seem to help himself from tweeting about things that, let's be honest, won't do anything to help the economy -- although Nordstrom investors are richer despite Trump attacking them for dumping his daughter Ivanka's brand.

But to give credit where it's due, it looks like the main reason that stocks have taken off again lately is because Trump has promised to unveil a ""phenomenal"" tax plan soon.

Trump also pledged again to invest more on infrastructure when he met with airline CEOs on Thursday.

That's what the market wants to hear.

""We still expect fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and less regulation,"" said Matt Lockridge, manager of the Westwood Small Cap Value Fund. ""The timing is the big question, but it's coming.""

Lockridge thinks that many companies that generate a majority of their revenues from America should benefit if Trump stimulus winds up kicking the economy into a higher gear.

He likes stocks in a variety of industries, such as movie theater owner Masco (MAS), snack food firm J & J (JJSF) and aerospace equipment company Kaman (KAMN).

Another money manager said he's also still bullish on small U.S. stocks that could get a lift from Trump policies.

Related: Wall Street has powerful seat at Trump's table

Barry James, president and CEO of James Investment Research, said he bought the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) the day after the election because he's confident Trump's stimulus plan will boost growth for U.S small businesses.

""When Trump said America first, I really think that's what he means,"" James said, adding that he thinks Internet phone service Vonage (VG), rent-to-own retailer Aaron's (AAN) and discount chain Big Lots (BIG) could all thrive if Trump's proposals go through.

But there's another reason why the U.S. markets are near all-time highs. Despite all of the uncertainty in Washington, the U.S. is still viewed as a paragon of relative stability compared to other parts of the world.

Europe's economy is still a big wild card thanks to Brexit, the rise of populism in France leading to worries about a so-called Frexit and more worries about the problem that never seems to go away -- Greece's debt woes.

Japan's economy remains stagnant as well. We're talking about more than just a lost decade now. It's plural. And China's economy is slowing down too.

Bond fund manager Bill Gross has often joked that America is like what Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson sang about in ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" -- the ""cleanest dirty shirt.""

To that end, analysts at bond rating firm Fitch wrote in a report Friday that ""elements of President Trump's economic agenda would be positive for growth,"" but added that ""the present balance of risks points toward a less benign global outcome.""

Of course, there are two sides to that coin. Trump's bombast could come back to haunt him.

His continued penchant for reprimanding companies that he disagrees with on Twitter could dent investor confidence.

And while his proposed travel ban on immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries has been overturned by the U.S. court system for now, the president has vowed to fight for its reinstatement.

Even if he loses that battle, it's still clear that Trump is serious on turning more inward, with plans for tariffs and border-adjusted taxes that could ignite trade wars with Mexico, China and Japan. That could hurt big U.S. multinational firms and lead to job cuts.

But investors still seem to believe/hope that the merits of Trump's pro-growth stimulus plans and tax cuts will outweigh the impact of isolationism. Let's hope they're right.

Investors may be holding their noses, closing their eyes and stuffing cotton in their ears to drown out the president. But they are still buying stocks.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_news_international/~3/iEhrtpS7cwY/index.html,CNN,International Market,TRUE
['Aj Willingham'],"(CNN) Just because it's on the internet doesn't make it true . It seems so simple, but if everyone knew that, Facebook and Google wouldn't have to pull bogus news sites from their advertising algorithms and people wouldn't breathlessly share stories that claim Donald Trump is a secret lizard person or Hillary Clinton is an android in a pantsuit.

It doesn't have to be this way. Fake news is actually really easy to spot -- if you know how. Consider this your New Media Literacy Guide.

NOTE: As we put this together, we sought the input of two communications experts: Dr. Melissa Zimdars , an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts whose dynamic list of unreliable news sites has gone viral, and Alexios Mantzarlis , the head of theat the Poynter Institute.

This one is tough, because satire doesn't pretend to be real and serves a purpose as commentary or entertainment. But if people are not familiar with a satire site, they can share the news as if it is legitimate.

The shocking or teasing headlines of these stories trick you into clicking for more information -- which may or may not live up to what was promised.

A type of misleading news, this may be an interpretation of a real news event where the facts are manipulated to fit an agenda.

These are the hardest to debunk, because they often contain a kernel of truth: A fact, event or quote that has been taken out of context. Look for sensational headlines that aren't supported by the information in the article.

These are the easiest to debunk and often come from known sham sites that are designed to look like real news outlets. They may include misleading photographs and headlines that, at first read, sound like they could be real.

First, know the different types of misleading and false news

""People think this [thinking] applies only for older people,"" she told CNN. ""I think even early education should be teaching about communication, media and the internet. Growing up with the internet doesn't necessarily mean you're internet savvy.""

Melissa Zimdars points out that even those who spend a lot of time online aren't immune to fake content.

""If we were a little slower to share and re-tweet content purely based on the headline, we'd go a good way towards combating flasehoods,"" he told CNN.

Alexios Mantzarlis trains fact-checkers for a living. He says it's important to have a ""healthy amount of skepticism"" and to think, really think, before sharing a piece of news.

For starters, here are 10 questions you should ask if something looks fake:

1. Does the story come from a strange URL?

Zimdars says sites with strange suffixes like "".co"" or "".su,"" or that are hosted by third party platforms like WordPress should raise a red flag. Some fake sites, like National Report, have legitimate-sounding, if not overly general names that can easily trick people on social sites. For instance, several fake reports from abcnews.com.co have gone viral before being debunked, including a June article that claimed President Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales.

2. Does the headline match the information in the article?

Mantzarlis says one of the biggest reasons bogus news spreads on Facebook is because people get sucked in by a headline and don't bother to click through.

Just this week, several dubious organizations circulated a story about Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi. ""Pepsi STOCK Plummets After CEO Tells Trump Supporters to 'Take Their Business Elsewhere',"" trumpeted one such headline.

However, the articles themselves didn't contain that quote nor evidence that Pepsi's stock saw a significant drop (it didn't). Nooyi did make recorded comments about Trump's election, but was never quoted telling his supporters to ""take their business elsewhere.""

3. Is it a recent story, or an old one that has been re-purposed?

Sometimes legitimate news stories can be twisted and resurrected years after the fact to create a false conflation of events. Mantzarlis recalls an erroneous story that actually cited a legitimate piece of news from CNNMoney.

A blog called Viral Liberty recently reported that Ford had moved production of some of their trucks from Mexico to Ohio because of Donald Trump's election win. The story quickly caught fire online -- after all, it seemed like a great win for the domestic auto industry.

It turns out, Ford did move some manufacturing from Mexico to Ohio -- in 2015 . It had nothing to do with the election results at all.

4. Are the supporting videos or photos verifiable?

Photos and videos can also be taken out of context to support a false claim. In April, the liberal site Occupy Democrats posted a video that purportedly showed a young woman getting removed from a bathroom by police for not looking feminine enough. This was during the height of the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" controversy, and the article clearly linked the two. ""IT BEGINS,"" read the headline.

However, there was no date on the video or evidence that it was shot in North Carolina, where the ""bathroom bill"" was to be passed.

In fact, according to Snopes , the same video was published to a Facebook page in 2015, meaning it predated the HB2 controversy.

5. Does the article cite primary sources?

It's not just political news that can be bogus. Now8News is one of the most infamous fake-but-looks-real site, specializing in the kind of weird news stories that often go viral.

One such article claims Coca-Cola recalled Dasani water bottles after a ""clear parasite"" was found in the water. There was even an accompanying gross-out picture that allegedly showed the parasite, though some basic Googling reveals it is most likely a photo of a young eel

Regardless, the article had no statement or claim from any company. Clearly this would be a big story. Dasani or any number of consumer advocacy groups would publish statements or news releases about it, right? There are none to be found -- because the story is 100% fake.

6. Does the story feature quotes, and are they traceable?

A favorite meme of Liberal Facebook groups features a fake quote from Donald Trump that is allegedly from a People Magazine interview in 1998:

""If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific.""

quote is nowhere to be found in them. This one is easily debunked if you take even a moment to think about it : People.com has extensive archives, and thisin them.

7. Is it the only outlet reporting the story?

During this election season, Pope Francis was roped into three super viral, and completely false, stories. According to various (fake) websites, the Pope endorsed three US Presidential candidates: First, Bernie Sanders, as ""reported"" by National Report and USAToday.com.co. Then, Donald Trump, as ""reported"" by fake news site WTOE 5 News. Finally, another fake news site KYPO6.com reported he had endorsed Hillary Clinton!

In all of these instances, subsequent reports all circled back to the fake ones. It's always good to trace a story back to the original source, and if you find yourself in a loop -- or if they all lead back to the same dubious site -- you have reason to doubt.

8. Is your own bias getting in the way?

Both Zimdars and Mantzarlis say confirmation bias is a big reason fake news speads like it does. Some of that is built into Facebook's algorithm -- the more you like or interact with a certain interest, the more Facebook will show you related to that interest.

Similarly, if you hate Donald Trump, you are more likely to think negative stories about Donald Trump are true, even if there is no evidence.

""We seek out information that already fits with our established beliefs,"" says Zimdars. ""If we come into contact with information we don't agree with, it still may reaffirm us because we will attempt to find faults.""

So if you find an outrageous article that feels ""too good to be true,"" use caution: It just might be.

9. Has it been debunked by a reputable fact-checking organization?

you're getting the real deal. View the whole list here. Did you know there is actually an International Fact-Checking Network (which Mantzarlis leads)? And that it has a code of principles? The code includes the ideals of nonpartisanship and transparency, among others. Sites like FactCheck.org, Snopes and Politifact abide by this code, so if you see a debunking there, you know

10. Is the host on a list of unreliable news websites?

things can get tricky. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. This is where. There's obviously a big difference between ""misleading"" news, which is usually based in fact, and ""fake"" news, which is just fiction disguised as fact. Zimdars' now-famous list covers both kinds, as well as satire and sites that capitalize on clickbait-type headlines. Snopes also maintains a list

While Zimdars is glad her list has gotten so much attention, she also cautions that completely writng off some of the sites as ""fake"" is not accurate. ""I want to make sure this list doesn't do a great disservice to the ultimate goal,"" she says. ""It's interesting that some of the headlines [about my list] are just as hyperbolic as the ones I am analyzing.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/g8ESQjzCp_Y/index.html,CNN,Tech,TRUE

['Sarah Sekula'],"Tampa, Florida (CNN) — When it comes to piloting a plane, I have zero experience.

In fact, I've never even considered attempting it.

Nevertheless, as we swoop over Florida's Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.

At 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it's known as a sea light-sport aircraft.

Designed to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there's nothing else quite like it on the market.

Now that I'm in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I'm not entirely sure.

However, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car.

Plus, the fact that Icon's CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn't hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.

So far, so good.

We glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I'm comfortable enough to take in the sights. Lovely Fort De Soto Park doesn't disappoint.

l e v a r t

Squiggles of dreamy white dunes are surrounded by water that looks like it should be in the Caribbean.

The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, with its series of long-spanning cables, is equally impressive.

The adrenaline is still racing. And as most surreal experiences go, it just keeps getting better.

For starters, there's another ICON A5 to my left, which is thrilling in itself. We are flying in formation, and my job is to mimic its movements. You'd think this would be intimidating, but it's not.

It's just plain fun.

That's music to Hawkins' ears. He's the brains behind this newfangled plane, an idea 10 years in the making.

As a former Air Force F-16 pilot and a Stanford Business School grad, he has focused most of his adult life on making sport flying available to the masses.

""The idea for us was to create an airplane where the average human being can go out and experience the world without having the burden of becoming a professional pilot,"" he says.

So it makes sense that the dashboard looks like what you see in your car. There are only a few gauges that I don't recognize.

""It's the Apple approach to things,"" he says. ""You humanize it, and make it intuitive and easy and cool.""

He's so confident people will want to fly (and buy) his planes that he just opened a flight-training facility at Peter O. Knight Airport.

Located on Davis Island, five minutes from downtown Tampa, it's a place where both beauty and sailboats abound.

The company's other training center is in Vacaville, California, where ICON is headquartered.

Wide eyes and open windows

By 9 a.m., it's time for a brief water-landing pitstop.

Hawkins takes over the controls. I've been too busy learning to fly in formation (not something non-pilots get to try very often) and interviewing Hawkins to even think about learning to do a water landing myself. It's something Hawkins tells me most people can master in about 30 minutes.

A few negative-Gs and 360-degree turns later and it becomes a fun roller-coaster ride in the sky. Plus, it's an open-air flight, so I occasionally flop my arms out. Just because I can.

At a few hundred feet above the water, it's easy to spot a boater waving at us, a flock of pelicans and even stingrays.

""We're gonna pull over here and stop and get out for a second,"" he says.

Surely he's kidding, right? But after landing the plane on the water, he takes off his seatbelt, and I realize he's not.

Seconds later, he pops the roof and we climb onto the wings, which could easily double as diving boards. Suddenly, this feels less like a plane outing and more like I'm on a boat sunbathing.

Everything is drenched in a mesmerizing golden hue. I can imagine picnicking on the beach nearby. Or taking the plane somewhere for a remote weekend camping trip.

Because the plane has a range of about 430 miles on a full tank, it's made for short getaways.

""This entire thing is about inspiring people,"" he explains. ""Once you learn to fly, you will never be the same. You will look at the sky different, you will look at the planet different.""

Designed to make flying simple

""The primary motor skills for operating a plane are pretty easy,"" Hawkins tells me. ""We have people landing by themselves with an instructor on their very first day, within 30 minutes.""

That said, they've painstakingly taken the time to design it for safety. The goal of the spin-resistant airframe feature is that if the pilot makes mistakes, the airplane doesn't lose control.

As a backup, there's a complete airplane parachute.

""The spin resistance feature is a big deal as it's the first airplane that the FAA has deemed spin-resistant,"" says Chris Dupin, a flight instructor and US Air Force officer. ""A significant number of general aviation fatalities are from loss of control accidents that involve an unrecovered spin on the base to final turn.""

Plus, there's the angle of attack indicator, something you don't typically see in a light aircraft. It shows you where the wing is happy (in the green) or where it could stall (in the red).

The pilot's job is to keep the wing within the green or yellow section of the gauge. This is part of what makes water takeoffs and landings so easy to learn.

Becoming a barnstormer

""Kirk Hawkins has an extremely creative and innovative idea for pilot training that is more intuitive; teaching the feel of flight first and the principals and structure later, not unlike how people learn to drive,"" says Christine Negroni, veteran aviation journalist and author of ""The Crash Detectives.""

""The world is facing a pilot shortage, so the idea of teaching differently, so that different learning styles can be accommodated could very well expand the pool of pilot candidates.""

On that note, about 40% of the folks who've put down deposits for the ICON A5 are not pilots, which means this plane is drawing aviation newbies.

After an hour and a half of flying time, Hawkins lands us on the airport runway, a maneuver that you can tackle after you've mastered several water landings. It's a bit trickier since it requires more precision and knowledge about crosswinds.

At this point, if I owned this plane, I'd hook it up to a trailer, fold the wings up, drive it home, and park it in the garage.

Get some air time

If you want your own ICON A5, get in line. More than 1,800 customers have put deposits down.

For those who aren't ready to shell out $207,000 to buy one, there's the option of stopping by ICON's training facility in Tampa, or the facility in Vacaville, California, to fly for the day.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/TmUmdkaEi9k/index.html,CNN,Tech,TRUE

['Nosmot Gbadamosi'],"Story highlights Africa will launch its first private satellite into space

It's been built by schoolgirls

(CNN) They may be teenagers, but 17-year-old Brittany Bull and 16-year-old Sesam Mngqengqiswa have grand ambitions -- to launch Africa's first private satellite into space in 2019.

They are part of a team of high school girls from Cape Town, South Africa, who have designed and built payloads for a satellite that will orbit over the earth's poles scanning Africa's surface.

Once in space, the satellite will collect information on agriculture, and food security within the continent.

Using the data transmitted, ""we can try to determine and predict the problems Africa will be facing in the future"", explains Bull, a student at Pelican Park High School.

South Africa's program aims to encourage girls into STEM, particularly astronomy. Less than 10% of young women are interested in STEM subjects.

""Where our food is growing, where we can plant more trees and vegetation and also how we can monitor remote areas,"" she says. ""We have a lot of forest fires and floods but we don't always get out there in time.""

['Ashley Strickland'],"(CNN) A six-month stay on the International Space Station can be a pain in the back for astronauts. While they may gain up to 2 inches in height temporarily, that effect is accompanied by a weakening of the muscles supporting the spine, according to a new study .

Astronauts have been reporting back pain since the late 1980s, when space missions grew longer. Their flight medical data show that more than half of US astronauts have reported back pain, especially in their lower backs. Up to 28% indicated that it was moderate to severe pain, sometimes lasting the duration of their mission.

Things don't improve when they return to Earth's gravity. In the first year after their mission, astronauts have a 4.3 times higher risk of a herniated disc.

""It's sort of an ongoing problem that has been a significant one with cause for concern,"" said Dr. Douglas Chang, first author of the new study and associate professor of orthopedic surgery and chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation service at University of California San Diego Health. ""So this study is the first to take it from just an epidemiological description and look at the possible mechanisms for what is going on with the astronauts' backs.""

Like being in a body cast

Much attention has been focused on intervertebral discs, the spongy shock absorbers that sit between our vertebrae, as the culprit for the back issues that astronauts face. But the new study runs counter to that thinking. In this research, funded by NASA, Chang's team observed little to no changes in the discs, their height or swelling.

What they did observe in six astronauts who spent four to seven months on the ISS was a tremendous degeneration and atrophying of the supporting musculature in the lumbar (lower) spine, Chang said. These muscles are the ones that help us stay upright, walk and move our upper extremities in an environment like Earth, while protecting discs and ligaments from strain or injury.

In microgravity, the torso lengthens, most likely due to spinal unloading, in which the spinal curvature flattens. Astronauts also aren't using the muscle tone in their lower backs because they aren't bending over or using their lower backs to move, like on Earth, Chang said. This is where the pain and stiffening occurs, much like if the astronauts were in a body cast for six months.

MRI scans before and after the missions revealed that the astronauts experienced a 19% decrease in these muscles during their flight. ""Even after six weeks of training and reconditioning here one Earth, they are only getting about 68% of their losses restored,"" Chang explained.

Chang and his team consider this a serious issue for long-term manned missions, especially when considering a trip to Mars that could take eight or nine months just to reach the Red Planet. That trip, and the astronauts' potential time spent in Martian gravity -- 38% of the surface gravity on Earth -- creates the potential for muscle atrophy and deconditioning.

The team's future research will also look at reported neck issues, where there can be even more occurrences of muscle atrophy and a slower recovery period. They are also hoping to partner with another university on inflight ultrasounds of the spine, to look at what happens to astronauts while they are on the space station.

Yoga in space?

Because nobody likes back pain and muscle loss, Chang suggested countermeasures that should be added to the already two- to three-hour workout astronauts have on the space station each day. Though their exercise machines focus on a range of issues including cardiovascular and skeletal health, the team believes that space travelers also need to include a core-strenghtening program focused on the spine.

In addition to the ""fetal tuck"" position astronauts use in microgravity to stretch their lower back or alleviate back pain, Chang suggested yoga. But he knows that is easier said than done.

""A lot of yoga depends on the effects of gravity, like downward dog, where a stretch through the hamstring, calf muscles, back of the neck and shoulders are possible because of gravity. When you remove that, you may not have the same benefit.""

Any machines on the space station also have to be designed with regards to weight, size and even the reverberations they could produce on the station.

Scott Parazynski, who walked in space seven times, assisted with construction on the space station in 2007.

Chang and the other researchers brainstormed with a virtual reality team about different exercise programs that would enable astronauts to invite friends, family or even Twitter followers to join them in a virtual workout, making the daily repetition of their workouts more fun and competitive.

One of Chang's teammates has felt this pain personally. Dr. Scott Parazynski is the only astronaut to summit Mount Everest. He experienced a herniated disc after returning from the ISS to Earth. Less than a year later, when he attempted to climb Everest the first time, he had to be airlifted off. After a rehabilitation process, he eventually made the summit. Now, he speaks to current astronauts about the ways they can contribute to studies about their health in microgravity.

Keeping the astronauts healthy and fit is the least they can do, Chang said.

""When a crew comes back, they say on one side of the space station, they see this beautiful blue planet,"" he said. ""Everything they hold dear to them is on this fragile little planet. And they look out the other window and just see infinity stretching off into the blackness, and they come back with a different sense of themselves and their place in the universe.

['Matthew Chance'],"(CNN) ""Attention! Attention!"" blares the Russian voice from a loudspeaker. ""The nuclear bombs will be launched in one hour.""

Inside a room styled as a Soviet-era nuclear bunker, a couple of Russians race to prevent a catastrophic strike on the United States.

Their quest -- the latest craze in Moscow -- is to find the nuclear launch codes and deactivate a hidden red button, which has already been pressed by a mad Russian general.

It's complete fantasy; just an interactive game hosted in a building in a former industrial area of the city, harking back to the fears of the Cold War.

But amid the current tensions with Russia, in which potential nuclear confrontation with the West has again been raised, it feels a little unsettling.

A mad Russian general has pushed the nuclear button - and gamers must stop missiles launching

""I'm worried because there is very stupid information from both sides,"" said Maxim Motin, a Russian who has just completed the Red Button Quest game.

""I know that normal people all over the world don't want any war,"" he added.

A nation preparing for conflict

But Russian officials have been preparing the nation for the possibility of conflict, stoking deep-seated concerns about a standoff with the West, Russia's old Cold War rival.

Russian television has been broadcasting a mass training exercise, involving up to 40 million people across the country. It is designed to prepare responses, the government says, for a chemical or nuclear attack.

The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry issued this picture from a nationwide civil defense drill

The video shows emergency workers with protective suits and gas masks leading the civil defense rehearsal, the biggest of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It suggests the Kremlin wants Russians to take the threat of war very seriously.

Of course, all-out conflict between Russia and the West remains highly unlikely.

Analysts say the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction -- or MAD -- still holds as a deterrent, just as it did during the Cold War.

But with tensions growing over Syria, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, analysts say a small risk of contact, misunderstanding and escalation between the nuclear superpowers has become very real.

""I don't think nuclear war is likely,"" says Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russia in Global Affairs , a prominent foreign policy journal.

""But when two nuclear superpowers are operating with their military machines in the same area, very close to each other and they don't have proper coordination, any unintended thing can happen,"" he told CNN.

Kremlin playing up fears

It is a risk the Kremlin seems keen to play up, with state television upping its hardline rhetoric in recent weeks.

In its flagship current affairs show, Russia's top state news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyev -- dubbed the Kremlin's propagandist-in-chief by critics -- recently issued a stark warning of global war if Russian and US forces clash in Syria.

""Brutish behavior towards Russia could have nuclear dimensions,"" he declared.

The Russian defense ministry has also released details of the latest intercontinental ballistic missile being added to its nuclear arsenal.

The Satan 2 , as it's known, will be the world's most destructive weapon, guaranteeing Russia's place as a top nuclear power.

It is an apocalyptic vision that adds a further sense of realism to the fantasy quest being acted out by gamers in Moscow.

""I know that now in schools in Russia they tell the children that our main enemy is the US,"" said Alisa Sokoleva, another Moscow gamer.

""But it sounds ridiculous to me and I'm totally sure that war is impossible,"" she adds.

The quest game players - pretending to be a special ops team - are the only ones who can avert war

Back in the fake Cold War bunker, the Russian gamers have cracked the launch codes and deactivated the missile launch. The United States, it seems, has again been saved from this virtual Russian nuclear attack.

They're all landmark Japanese inventions from the 80s and 90s, symbols of an era when the Asian nation was a world leader in tech innovation.

But with the rise of Silicon Valley, and American tech giants such as Google and Apple, has seen Japan produce less era-defining tech over the past two decades.

That, says Professor Masahiko Tsukamoto, of Kobe University's Graduate School of Engineering , is about to change thanks to a new generation of young entrepreneurs, an uptick in international collaborations, and new partnerships with university scientists.

Japan's focus this time around is not on smart phones or gaming, but wearable chairs, smart glasses and dog communication devices.

The dog whisperer

Inupathy is a dog harness slated to launch at the end of this year that will allow pet owners to communicate with their dogs.

As well as a heart monitor, the harness features noise-canceling technology which can isolate the animal's heartbeat and track its reactions to stimulus, such as food, games, people and toys.

With this data, the harness assesses a dog's mood and changes color to inform the owners.

Equipped with six LED lights, the collar glows blue to show calm, red for excitement, and displays a rainbow theme for happiness.

Joji Yamaguchi, CEO of Inupathy, was inspired by his Corgi, Akane, who was a nervous puppy. To better understand the dog's anxiety, the biologist developed Inupathy to monitor his heart rate.

The chair enables its wearer to effectively sit down and stand up at the same time.

The Archelis chair.

""The Archelis concept is very simple, like the simplicity of Columbus' egg,"" says Dr Hiroshi Kawahira, the surgeon behind the concept. ""Long surgeries can result in back pain, neck pain, and knee pain -- especially for surgeons who are older.""

Made of 3D-printed panels, Archelis does not require any electrical components or batteries.

The innovation is in the effective design: flexible carbon panels wrap around the buttocks, legs and feet to provide support and minimize pressure on joints.

The system stabilizes the ankles and knees, so the pressure from being upright is spread evenly across the shins and thighs.

Though the wearer appears to be standing, in fact, they are resting their back and legs while working on their feet.

['Susan Scutti'],"For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers at night is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality, new research finds. Even children who don't use their phones or the other technologies littering their bedrooms at night are losing shut-eye and becoming prone to daylight sleepiness, the analysis published today in JAMA Pediatrics finds.

The analysis found ""a consistent pattern of effect across a wide range of countries and settings,"" said Dr. Ben Carter, lead author and a senior lecturer in biostatistics at King's College London.

Carter and his colleagues weeded through the medical literature to identify hundreds of applicable studies conducted between January 1, 2011, and June 15, 2015. They chose 20 research reports involving a total of 125,198 children, evenly divided by gender, with an average age of 14½ years. After extracting pertinent data, Carter and his co-authors performed their own meta-analysis.

Few parents will be surprised by the results: The team found a ""strong and consistent association"" between bedtime media device use and inadequate sleep quantity, poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Surprisingly, though, Carter and his team discovered that children who did not use their devices in their bedrooms still had their sleep interrupted and were likely to suffer the same problems. The lights and sounds emitted by the technology, as well as the content itself, may be too stimulating.

Though Carter admits that a weakness of the analysis was ""how the data was collected in the primary studies: self-reported by parents and children,"" many of us will probably recognize our own families' habits reflected in the statistics.

Electronic bedroom

A large-scale poll conducted in the United States by the National Sleep Foundation (PDF) reported in 2013 that 72% of all children and 89% of teens have at least one device in their sleep environment. Most of this technology is used near bedtime, that same report found.

According to Carter and his co-authors, this omnipresent technology negatively influences children's sleep by delaying their sleep time, as they finish watching a movie or play one more game.

Light emitted from these devices may also affect the circadian rhythm, the internal clock timing biological processes, including body temperature and hormone release, the researchers explain. One specific hormone, melatonin, induces tiredness and contributes to the timing of our sleep-wake cycles. Electronic lights can delay the release of melatonin, disrupting this cycle and making it harder to fall asleep.

Carter and his co-authors also suggest that online content may be psychologically stimulating and keep children and teens awake far past the hour when they turn off their devices and try to sleep.

""Sleep is vital for children,"" said Dr. Sujay Kansagra, director of the pediatric neurology sleep medicine program at Duke University Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. ""We know that sleep plays a crucial role in brain development, memory, self-regulation, attention, immune function, cardiovascular health and much more.""

Kansagra, author of "" My Child Won't Sleep ,"" noted that the period of greatest brain development is in our first three years of life, which corresponds to when we need and get the most sleep. ""It's hard to believe that this would be a coincidence.""

Kansagra said it's possible that parents underreported kids using devices at night, but more likely, the technology is simply interfering with sleep hygiene. ""For example, children who are allowed to keep devices in their room may be more likely to avoid a good sleep routine, which we know is helpful for sleep,"" he said.

Practicing good sleep hygiene

Dr. Neil Kline, a representative of the American Sleep Association, agrees that sleep plays an integral role in a child's healthy development, even though ""we don't know all of the science behind it. There is even some research which demonstrates an association between ADHD and some sleep disorders.""

In many respects, the findings of the new study are no surprise. ""Sleep hygiene is being significantly impacted by technology, especially in the teen years,"" said Kline, who bases his opinion not only on research but on his own ""personal experience and also the anecdotes of many other sleep experts.""

Sleep hygiene -- tips that help facilitate good, continuous and adequate sleep -- include having a room that is quiet. ""And that would mean removing items that interfere with sleep, including electronics, TV and even pets if they interfere with sleep,"" Kline said.

One more important tip comes from the National Sleep Foundation , which recommends at least 30 minutes of ""gadget-free transition time"" before bedtime. Power down for better sleep.

Other recommendations for good sleep hygiene include not exercising (physically or mentally) too close to bedtime; establishing a regular sleep schedule; limiting exposure to light prior to sleep; avoiding stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bedtime; and creating a dark, comfortable and peaceful sleep environment.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/grZ2k7Zm__0/index.html,CNN,Tech,TRUE

With a string of global sporting events being halted in a response to the crisis, Abe has moved to dampen speculation that the Games, due to take place from July 24 to August 9, could be postponed, or even canceled.

""We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned,"" Abe told the news conference in Tokyo, but added the International Olympic Committee (IOC) would have the final decision whether Tokyo 2020 takes place.

His comments came after Tokyo 2020 organizers announced that the Greek leg of the Olympic torch relay had been canceled, but also insisted the Games would go ahead on schedule.

The 29-year-old South African is unable to defend the 800m title she won for a second time at the 2016 Rio Olympics because she is refusing to comply with new World Athletics regulations that require her to take testosterone-limiting medication.

Those rules apply to all events between the 400m and the 1500m, with Semenya switching to the 200m after failing to impress in longer distance events.

""My dream has always been, and will continue to be, to compete at the highest level of sport,"" Semenya announced in a statement on her Instagram account.

""So in order pursue my goals and dreams, I have decided to change events and compete in the 200m.

['Aimee Lewis'],"(CNN) As Covid-19 spreads with alacrity around the world, billion-dollar sports leagues have been brought to a halt.

Thursday in the US was one of the most extraordinary in the country's sports history as the NBA, the WNBA and the much-anticipated NCAA's men's and women's basketball tournaments were among the major events suspended or postponed.

Competitions once regarded as shatterproof have been affected. The English Premier League, often described as the world's richest soccer league, on Friday announced a suspension.

But the Olympic Games , the biggest sporting spectacle of all, is still set to go ahead, which begs the question: with society shutting down as a result of a worldwide pandemic, will the Olympics really be held in Tokyo this summer?

What has been said?

On Friday, Japan's Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto dismissed suggestions that Tokyo 2020 should be postponed.

Responding to comments made by US President Donald Trump, who had suggested the Games should be rescheduled, Hashimoto said neither the local organizing committee or the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had considered postponing or canceling the Games.

""We continue to proceed preparations to hold a safe and secure Games that will open on July 24,"" said Hashimoto.

On March 12, the day the Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia without spectators because of ongoing concerns over COVID-19, the IOC said it was ""fully committed"" to holding the Games, set to run from July 24 to August 9, in Tokyo.

""Nineteen weeks before the opening ceremony of the Games we are strengthened in our commitment by many organizations around the world taking significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus,"" Thomas Bach, the IOC president, said.

Much is still unknown

The coronavirus has infected more than 132,500 people and killed nearly 5,000 globally, according to the World Health Organization.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients, compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza, but much remains unknown about it.

Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared with neighboring South Korea and China. However, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.

The country experienced an uptick in numbers on Tuesday, with 54 more cases reported -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.

And Japan has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak, specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay.

A woman wearing a face mask walks past the Olympic rings in front of the new National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020.

Health experts have also previously raised concerns over the country's approach to testing, which has seen only small numbers screened for the virus.

Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the ""tip of the iceberg.""

This week the country canceled the annual public service in Tokyo which marks the Fukushima disaster.

The start of the baseball, football and rugby sevens seasons have already been delayed, while a major sumo tournament that opened in Osaka last weekend was held without spectators for the first time in its history.

With the Games still scheduled to go ahead, the outbreak in Japan and the government's handling of it will continue to be under heightened scrutiny.

What are the options for Tokyo 2020?

If the Games were being held now, it would be difficult to imagine how organizers could go ahead as planned. Thousands of people converging in Tokyo during a pandemic would surely not be countenanced.

But Tokyo 2020 has time. Experts hope warmer weather will help fight the virus, though it is yet unclear whether that theory is true.

The Olympic movement essentially has two opportunities to make money, at the Summer Games and the Winter Olympics, so with billions of dollars at stake, in ticket sales, hospitality and sponsorship especially, organizers are as yet unwilling to contemplate a delay or cancellation.

With the authority to cancel the Games, it is the IOC which is in control. Earlier this month, IOC member Dick Pound admitted a decision to cancel could be made as late as May.

The situation remains fluid and talk of holding the Games elsewhere has been widely quashed. As Professor Victor Matheson, a sports economist who has written on the economics of the Olympics, told CNN Sport: ""Any world where Japan is too unsafe to hold the Olympics, London is also too unsafe to hold the Olympics.""

It is widely regarded that the options available are: to hope the outbreak eases and go ahead as planned, to hold the Games without spectators, to postpone or cancel completely.

The economic costs of Tokyo 2020

Canceling the Games would be unprecedented in peacetime.

The cost of hosting, organizers said in December, was some 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion) but, according to Reuters, that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat.

According to Reuters, Japan's Board of Audit put government spending on the Games between 2013 and 2018 at 1.06 trillion yen ($9.81billion). Sponsors, insurers and broadcasters have also committed billions to the Games.

Professor Matheson believes the truer sum is likely to be $25 billion, a vast majority of which has already been spent on large-scale infrastructure projects such as transportation networks, hotels and new venues.

""Whether the Games go on or not, most of this investment is a sunk cost at this point,"" Professor Matheson said.

""If you were to cancel the Olympics, you would be able to avoid some of the costs, such as billion dollars of security, if Tokyo's security costs were similar to London, but the biggest cost is all of the infrastructure and most of that spending has already taken place.""

A general view of the Olympic rings as they are illuminated for the first time to mark 6 months to go to the Olympic games at Odaiba Marine Park on January 24, 2020.

If the Tokyo 2020 was canceled, who'd be the losers?

Professor Matheson points to the IOC and the local organizing committee as being among the biggest losers in the event of cancellation, though both organizations will be insured.

""This isn't Delta Airlines, where we cancel a bunch of flights but once we solve the problem things are back to normal,"" he said, describing the Olympics as ""totally non-diversified.""

Another big loser would be Tokyo's hospitality industry.

""If we look at other host cities, the total number of international tourists was likely to increase by 100,000 visitors and those visitors were paying much higher room rental rates than the people they would have been replacing,"" said Matheson.

""That's potentially at least hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in lost revenue for the hospitality industry and that's probably not insurable.""

And then there are the sponsors, Matheson adds: ""If the Games don't go on at all, there are $3 billion worth of sponsorships that have been purchased and it's hard to know where that money goes if the Games don't all go on.

""That is a loss to someone, that's either a loss to broadcasters or it's a loss to the IOC, because they don't get the revenue from the contract, or it's a loss to an insurer.

""Somewhere along the line you have this valuable product that was going to produce all this TV entertainment and someone's going to lose that revenue somewhere.""

Japan's GDP, however, would not take a significant hit, said Matheson.

""In any scenario where the Olympic Games are canceled, the other costs associated with coronavirus are going to make the Olympic costs seem like a drop in the bucket.""

What is the least costly alternative for the IOC?

Postponing the Games by a few months has been mentioned as an option for the IOC should it be deemed unsafe for the Games to go ahead as scheduled.

But TV rights holders would be unhappy with having to schedule the Olympics during the NFL season in the US and the European soccer season.

After all, the Games are being held in August, despite the potential dangers the scorching weather could pose to athletes, because the wants of rights holders far outweighs that of the athletes.

If the show was unable to go on as planned, holding the Games this summer without spectators would be the least costly, according to Matheson.

Sponsors, athletes, and TV rightsholders would still have an Olympics, he said, with Japan's tourism sector being the biggest loser.

""You still need the athletes and production officials, which may still be too many people in one place during a severe outbreak. It would cost you all your tourism money and about a billion dollars in ticket revenue,"" said Matheson.

""But you still get to keep your $3-4 billion of TV rights. The athletes are still on the world stage and you get to keep the majority of your sponsorship money.

""It keeps a lot of your revenue intact and there's no scheduling issues. Postponing it by a year would be massively costly, this would be multibillions of dollars, but at least you would have all your revenue streams intact that year later.""

The National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (C-R).

What about the athletes?

Competing at the Olympics is the pinnacle for the majority of athletes taking part. Sacrifices have been made, lives put on hold, training sessions meticulously planned for a career-defining moment.

If the Games were to be canceled, so too would an athlete's shot at glory. Gone would be the opportunity to become an Olympic champion and the sponsorship opportunities that come with that. Then, there are the older athletes, those who have one final chance at greatness. There is an economic cost, and a human one too.

There are also the athletes who have yet to secure qualification. Athletes needing to improve their rankings may miss out completely because qualification events have been rescheduled. Baseball's final qualifying event, for example, has been moved from April to June.

Simone Biles is expected to be one of the star athletes at Tokyo 2020

Dave Hembrough, Sheffield Hallam University's lead for strength and conditioning, told CNN Sport said that while athletes were resilient the uncertainty would be disruptive, especially to those attempting to qualify and attending training camps.

""Those who are the best in the world will be so driven for the purpose of being the best, it won't disturb them much,"" he said.

""But if athletes don't qualify, they don't compete and it might lead to organizations not having the best athletes qualifying and, therefore, reducing the chance of winning medals.

""I'm involved with British weightlifting ... one of the things people are concerned with is the financial commitment of signing up for camps for competition, travel for hotels that are then going to be subsequently canceled. A lot of organizations cannot afford that.""

Utah Jazz all-star center Rudy Gobert tested positive, according to ESPN and other media outlets, shortly before his team's game Wednesday night against the host Oklahoma City Thunder.

The NBA postponed that game right before tip-off after it learned the diagnosis, surprising thousands of fans already in their seats at Chesapeake Energy Arena. Not long afterward, the league announced it would suspend the season ""until further notice"" after the night's slate of games around the country.

Four other NBA games were played Wednesday night -- but one other, a tilt between the New Orleans Pelicans and the Sacramento Kings in California, was called off because a referee assigned to work the game had previously worked a Jazz game, the NBA said.

The NBA's suspension is an outlier for professional sports in the United States, a country more used to seeing leagues stop or shrink seasons because of labor issues or, more rarely, war

Making sacrifices

In Europe, Italy has been hardest hit, with the entire country put on lockdown, as the government tries to gain control of the spread.

All domestic sport in Italy has been suspended until April 3 although Italian clubs in UEFA competitions -- such as Juventus' Champions League tie against Lyon -- are still eligible to play matches behind closed doors.

In response, 18-time top-flight champion AC Milan announced it would donate $284,000 (€250,000) to relief efforts tackling the virus, as well as reimbursing fans who were not able to attend games that took place behind closed doors.

The donation goes to the Azienda Regionale Emergenza Urgenza, the emergency response arm of the Lombardy region's government.

""There are things in life more important than football,"" Milan CEO Ivan Gazidis said in a statement. ""At a time when all of us need to take care of the most vulnerable amongst us, we must all act with the utmost responsibility and listen to the advice of the relevant authorities.

""We are all worried about those nearest and dearest to us and about the implications for the future. Milan is more than a football club.""

Inter Milan and its owner Suning International will also donate 300,000 medical masks to Italian Civil Protection in support of the crisis.

Elsewhere in Italy, on what should have been one of the most historic nights in the club's history, fans of Atalanta announced that they would be making a donation of $45,000 (€40,000) to a northern Italian hospital.

The team was playing the second leg of its first Champions League last 16 tie in its history in Valencia -- with a 4-1 lead -- but because of the virus, the game was played behind closed doors, meaning fans had to stay in Italy.

['George Ramsay'],"(CNN) Once he had overcome the aching, agonizing cold of the water -- and while he continued to negotiate a tunnel cluttered with enormous stalactites -- Lewis Pugh was struck by the colors.

This was like nothing he had seen before, a kaleidoscope that twisted between turquoise, electric blue, royal blue, indigo and violet, before darkness took over.

Pugh had risked his life by plunging into Antarctic water in just a pair of skin-tight swimming trunks; the rewards were as mesmerizing as they were unsettling.

""I don't think I've ever seen anything as beautiful as that, just the sheer colors,"" Pugh, who has swum in some of the world's most remote waters as UN Patron of the Oceans, tells CNN Sport.

""But it was also incredibly terrifying ... The colors were magnificent, but they hid a dark secret. And I say it's a secret because people seem to be ignoring it.""

Pugh swam down a sub-glacial river underneath the Antarctic ice sheet in January, and in doing so experienced firsthand the level of melting that is taking place in East Antarctica.

Over the course of the 10-minute swim, he braved water temperatures of 0.1 degrees centigrade and air temperatures of minus 15.

The feat is part of a foolhardy initiative dubbed ""Speedo diplomacy,"" in which Pugh takes himself and his swimming trunks to the frontline line of climate change.

He has swum at the North Pole, Everest, and the Ross Sea, but the circumstances surrounding the most recent expedition in Antarctica proved unique.

""I could barely breathe, I was gasping for air,"" says Pugh, recalling the moment he first entered the water.

""The cold initially, it's burning all over my skin. My hands and my feet were in absolute agony. My body is saying get out, get out, get out. My mind is saying focus, focus, focus.

""It's not about bravado, it's about sending the right message. I don't think swimming in a wetsuit or a drysuit sends the right message.""

When Pugh reached the end of his swim, he was hauled out of the water by Russian ice hockey great and close friend Slava Fetisov.

""His skin felt so fragile, like (it could have) broken up into little pieces in a second,"" Fetisov, an Olympic gold medalist in 1984 and 1988, tells CNN Sport.

""I've never seen a man be cold like that ... But in his eyes there was so much life and so much hope.""

Pugh is helped out of the water by close friend and ice hockey great Slava Fetisov.

The temperature of the water was just one hurdle Pugh had to overcome.

He was forced to take slow, deliberate strokes as the tunnel he was swimming down started to narrow. Huge stalactites hung from the tunnel roof; knocking one could have been catastrophic.

Then there was the threat of falling ice and of being sucked down a moulin -- a giant sinkhole in the ice sheet that plummets hundreds of meters to the bedrock.

It became so dark at one point on his swim that Pugh was forced to remove his goggles and swim careful breaststroke to find his way.

""I had to be 100% focused,"" he says.

""I focused on every single stroke, trying to make it as powerful and as forward-moving as possible. It's important when you're swimming in those environments to be psyched up, but not psyched out.""

Pugh examines a glacial tunnel where stalactites hang from the roof.

The aim of the expedition was to convince policy makers to introduce a marine protected area in East Antarctica.

Similar to national parks, these protect certain parts of the world from extractive and destructive activities -- in the case of Antarctica, industrial overfishing -- and make them more resilient to climate change.

Having already negotiated a marine protection area in the Ross Sea in 2016, this year Pugh hopes to agree to three more, one in East Antarctica, one in the Weddell Sea and one on the Antarctic Peninsula.

Collectively, this would cover four million square kilometers -- roughly double the size of Western Europe, according to Pugh -- with China and Russia still needed to agree to the proposal.

Upon returning from Antarctica, Pugh traveled to the Kremlin to meet with Vladimir Putin's team, where he says he had ""very warm and constructive discussions."" He hopes to travel to Beijing later this year.

Pugh (right) met with President Putin's team alongside Fetisov (second right) earlier this year.

""It all just reaffirms my view that we now need to join the dots,"" says Pugh.

""Because I've seen the Arctic sea ice melt, we've all seen these horrific fires in California and in Australia , and I've seen glaciers retreat all over the world -- in the Himalayas, in the Arctic and in the Antarctic.

""But now to see an enormous ice sheet and just to see so much water flowing off an enormous ice sheet. It is very, very, very concerning.""

Pugh has witnessed accelerated melting of ice in Antarctica.

Earlier this year, scientists at the University of Durham revealed that there were 65,000 supraglacial lakes -- that is, lakes on top of a glacier -- in East Antarctica.

In November, world leaders will meet in Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26 , the main United Nations climate change negotiations for the year.

""We need world leaders now to step up, to be courageous, or to step aside,"" says Pugh.

""They need to come prepared, they must come with ambition, they must come with focus, they must come with concrete measures which can turn this crisis around ... Time has now run out.""

Fetisov, who supported Pugh throughout the Antarctica expedition, introduced the Briton to the Russian ministers needed to sign the Ross Sea agreement in 2016.

Fetisov (left) and Pugh speak in Moscow following their Antarctica expedition.

The pair are long-time friends, bound by the shared belief that, in Fetisov's words, we are ""a step away from a huge ecological catastrophe.""

It's what has motivated the former ice hockey star, who won his seven world championship and two Olympic titles in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, to raise awareness of the climate crisis. In 2018, he was appointed UN Environment Patron for Polar Regions.

""I played defense all my life and I feel it,"" says Fetisov. ""It's time to defend.

""I can't look in the eyes of children and young people and say no, it's probably not going to happen -- it is going to happen.""

His latest project, ""The Last Game,"" involves traveling the world -- they've been to Israel, the UAE, Finland, Singapore, Moscow and New York -- to raise awareness of climate change.

The next stop, weather permitting, is to take the initiative to the North Pole.

Fetisov, a fearsome defenseman in his playing days, believes sport can be a powerful player when it comes to the environment.

""Athletes are the most popular people on the planet,"" he says.

""They can gain trust from citizens because they work hard, they know about results and know how to get everybody in a team on the same page.

""Every day around the world we've got big sport competitions. We can use sport more and more to promote ecological problems, that's my belief.""

Fetisov participates in a ""Last Game"" event in New York.

Growing up in Moscow, Fetisov used to skate outside from October until April. By February this year, he says, there was no snow on the ground in the Russian capital.

"['Ben Church', 'Cnn Video Produced Noura Abou Zeinab']","(CNN) Inspirational, but tough as nails, Monica Aldama is a coach you don't want to mess about with or disappoint.

Aldama is very much the star of Netflix's latest mega-hit Cheer -- the six-part series which reveals the world of cheerleading at its mesmerizing, bone-crunching and jaw-dropping best.

Mapping the season of Navarro College's dominant cheer squad, the viral sensation has changed the way thousands of people view the sport.

Dedication, sacrifice and hours of practice are laid bare as young athletes from across the US find sanctuary in the most unlikely of places.

""I'm very competitive and I want to be successful but I also want to be that person that leads by example. I really set a high standard for myself,"" Aldama, who has become known as the ""Queen of Cheer,"" told CNN Sport.

""If I expect something from my kids, I should expect it from myself too. I shouldn't even have to say anything but my actions will lead the kids and they'll do the things I'm doing.""

Cheer coach Monica Aldama spoke to CNN Sport about life after the Netflix show.

Ellen and Oprah

Aldama had already established herself as one of the best cheer coaches in the sport, but not even she could have prepared herself for what happened next.

Appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Oprah's live tour catapulted the entire team to stardom and shone a bright light on Aldama's unrivaled success and methods.

Her glittering career has included 14 National Championships as a coach and her style has been compared to some of sports' most revered leaders.

""It's very strange, because I've had so many people view me in different ways after watching this show,"" Aldama said. ""Some people love me, some people don't.

""I know where my heart is and I know what happened the other four months that were not in those six hours. I would not change anything.""

The kids Aldama continually refers to throughout the show are the young adults who manage to secure a place on her acclaimed team.

It's an elite squad made up of students from a variety of backgrounds from all over the US, uniting together in a remote corner of Texas as they are rigorously drilled to compete at the very top of their game.

For many of the teenagers, a place in Aldama's team is a ticket out of trouble and a chance to make a better life for themselves.

The series, directed by Greg Whiteley, highlights the often harrowing back stories of some of the cheerleaders and Aldama is acutely aware that her role stretches way beyond coaching complex acrobatic moves.

She is as much a mother figure to her students as she is a coach, soaking up their anxieties and pushing them to succeed in both their personal and professional lives.

The docuseries follows the Navarro College cheer team in their pursuit of success.

Aldama helps create mind-blowing routines.

'I don't have to prove myself'

One of the young people to flourish under Aldama's wing is Morgan Simianer

The talented gymnast has become one of the breakout stars from the show, with her complicated history providing the series with one of its most emotional moments.

We learn how Simianer was forced to raise herself in a trailer after her biological parents abandoned her at an early age, but how that turbulent childhood gave her an unwavering drive to succeed.

It's an attitude that comes across crystal clear in a series where her loyalty to Aldama, who seems to provide a pillar of stability in Simianer's life, is resolute.

""I've really tried to work over the years on being better at that and just learning what I could do to fill those roles for those kids,"" added Aldama as she reflected on the complexity of coaching the team.

""I think that's really why I'm still here, it's not cheerleading. I've won plenty of titles, I don't have to prove myself there. It's the relationship with the kids and the feeling of watching them succeed.

""I feel like it's God's purpose for me and that's why I haven't left the job yet.""

Make no mistake, as much as Navarro College is a sanctuary for many, corners are never cut in the constant search for success.

Aldama demands nothing but 100% dedication to the cause with eyes firmly set on the annual National Championship in Daytona, scene of the thrilling finale to the series.

Her mantra is to ""keep going until you get it right, and then you keep going until you can't get it wrong,"" though that level of expectation pushes her charges to the very edge of their physical and emotional capabilities.

Morgan Simianer is one of the young cheerleaders who features in the show.

Injury heavy

Aldama's trademark moves -- breathtaking somersaults, tumbles, and stunning pyramids -- combine to deliver an explosive two minutes and 15 seconds routine which can occasionally go wrong.

""They showed every time we fell but they didn't show the one thousand times that we did it right or the progressions that we did to build up to the harder skills,"" said Aldama when asked whether the series gave an accurate depiction of the program she runs.

""We definitely are very safe, but it is cheerleading. It's a risky sport that we're doing but we do take precautions and I think that it was just a little heavy on the injuries.""

What's not in doubt is that the special culture forged at the college seems to encourage its stars to push through blood, sweat, and tears for the sake of the team ethic.

Notably former squad members return to help mentor the latest crop, a feature of the program that Monica takes immense pride in.

However, her coaching style is not just with competition in mind. Preparing these young adults for life in the real world is equally important to her.

""Self-accountability is just such a big thing for me, because so many people in this day and age, want to shift the blame to others and just not take responsibility for their own actions,"" Aldama said.

""If you've made a commitment to be somewhere, then you should show up. If it's class, then you should show up. If it's practice, you should show up. If it's a job, you should show up.""

Aldama said the training is very safe despite the show focusing on injuries.

True athletes

As well as enhancing the Navarro College cheer team's reputation, Aldama hopes the hit show can also help the sport establish itself in the mainstream.

So often viewed through the lens of tired stereotypes, the show has given the sport a platform to show just how athletic it can be when done properly.

""These kids are honestly some of the toughest kids I know. The work ethic that these kids have is top notch, they will come in and work, work, work. Work through the pain,"" Aldama added.

""The commitment is unreal. I just didn't feel like people who aren't a part of this world really knew that these kids are that athletic and that they have that grit and that determination.

""I was hoping that the world would see them as the true athletes that they are.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/WRJHX_wI8qU/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE

['Matias Grez'],"(CNN) Atletico Madrid stunned Liverpool with three goals in extra time to knock the holders out of the Champions League.

With the tie level at the end of the 90 minutes thanks to Georginio Wijnaldum's header, Roberto Firmino looked to have scored the tie-winning goal just four minutes into extra time.

But two goals from substitute Marcos Llorente in the space of eight minutes, the first courtesy of a howler from stand-in keeper Adrian, drew the sides level on the night and gave Atletico the lead on aggregate.

Anfield was stunned into total silence as coach Jurgen Klopp looked bemused on the touchline, arms held out disbelievingly.

Alvaro Morata scored the third in the final few seconds to secure a memorable 4-2 aggregate win for Atletico.

This stadium had been the site of one of the greatest ever Champions League comebacks last season, as Liverpool overturned a 3-0 first-leg deficit against Barcelona to reach the final.

Tonight, it's the site of one of Liverpool's most painful European defeats.

Atletico Madrid celebrate Marcos Llorente's second goal.

Pantomime villain

There would have been more than a few hearts in mouths inside the opening 20 seconds at Anfield, as Joao Felix's slick turn and pass set Diego Costa through on goal.

The Spanish striker, a familiar foe for Liverpool from his time at Chelsea, could only skew his shot into the side netting but it was an early reminder for Liverpool of the quality that Atletico Madrid possesses going forward.

Costa was soon slipping into his preferred role of pantomime villain, petulantly throwing the ball away as Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian attempted to take a quick free-kick.

It was a tactic Atletico had been expected to employ in an attempt to frustrate both the Liverpool fans and players into submission and reduce the game to a scrappy affair.

They succeeded in doing exactly that but Liverpool was giving as good as it was getting, ferociously snapping into tackles with

From the outset, Anfield wasn't quite at its famous levels of noise -- perhaps the torrential rain had dampened the atmosphere somewhat -- but Wijnaldum's stinging strike, palmed away brilliantly by Jan Oblak, was enough to spark the crowd into life.

Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates his opening goal.

As had been expected, Liverpool dominated possession inside the opening 30 minutes but, Wijnaldum's effort aside, hadn't troubled Atletico's back line.

Diego Simeone's side is widely considered the best defensive unit in European football and as Liverpool's attacks were repelled again and again, it sometimes felt as though it was crossing balls into a brick wall.

But Liverpool's pressure eventually started to tell and a few of those bricks started coming loose; Wijnaldum once again tested Oblak before he eventually found a way through.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found the Dutchman totally unmarked in the middle of the penalty area and he directed his header down into the wet turf and into the top corner.

Wijnaldum is making a habit of scoring big goals for Liverpool in the Champions League; last season, he scored a brace to haul Liverpool level in that famous semifinal comeback win against Barcelona.

Anfield roared into life and Atletico's players spent the remaining two minutes of the first half desperately waiting for the half-time whistle to blow.

Backs to the wall

Those 15 minutes respite changed very little and Atleti's players were back out in the second half and immediately had their backs to the wall.

Again they had Oblak to thank for keeping them level in the tie, as the Slovenian stopper did brilliantly to save efforts from Oxlande-Chamberlain and Roberto Firmino.

But midway through the second half, Liverpool was given a sharp warning of how quickly this tie could change.

Felix, Atletico's $142 million star signing, managed to wriggle free on the edge of the area and his deflected effort brought an awkward save out of Adrian.

Liverpool's stand-in keeper should have dealt with the effort comfortably but presented Angel Correa with an opportunity from his weak parry, though he did eventually manage to smother the ball.

With little more than 20 minutes remaining, the whole of Anfield thought Liverpool had found the tie-winning goal.

Marcos Llorente celebrates his second goal in extra time.

After ricocheting around in the box, the ball found its way to Andy Robertson at the far post but Kieran Trippier did brilliantly to get a slight touch on the header and deflect it onto the crossbar.

In the dying seconds, totally against the run of play, Atleti thought it had found the winner.

Renan Lodi's free-kick into the box was met by Saul Niguez's thumping header into the top corner. The 3,000 Atletico fans behind that goal went wild, as did the entire Atleti bench, but their celebrations were cut short by the linesman's flag for an obvious offside.

30 minutes of madness

Extra time started at a blistering pace and Firmino, with his first Anfield goal all season, looked to have secured passage through to the quarterfinals, reacting fastest after his header had hit the post to stab the rebound home.

But then it was the turn of Adrian to take center stage, the player called upon the least throughout the 90 minutes and as much of a spectator as the 60,000 fans inside Anfield.

The Spaniard's scuffed clearance gifted the ball to substitute Llorente, who did brilliantly to bend the ball into the vacant far corner of the goal.

Then, just like that, it was two.

Some lazy defending from both Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk gifted Llorente with space on the edge of the area and he curled another unerring strike into the bottom corner.

Anfield was silent, save for the small pocket of delirious Atletico fans at the opposite end of the stadium.

With seconds remaining, Alvaro Morata popped up to score Atelti's third and emphatically seal passage through to the quarterfinals.

['Matias Grez'],"(CNN) The Spanish league that Marta Corredera made her debut in more than a decade ago is almost unrecognizable to the one she plays in today.

In the 12 years since she first appeared for Espanyol, attendances have increased, a television deal has been agreed and a major title sponsor has been signed.

However, last month saw the biggest and most important change of them all as the female players in Spain's top division secured an historic league-wide agreement that will guarantee every footballer an annual salary.

The minimum full-time player wage agreed for a 40-hour week is €16,000 ($18,000) and for a part-time 30-hour week is €12,000 ($13,600), with both including maternity leave, injury pay and paid holiday.

""It's the reward for all the hard work we've been putting in for years,"" Corredera, who now plays for Levante, tells CNN.

""In the end, not only as female footballers but any female workers we have the rights to have laws and rules that shelter us and protect us -- until now we were totally unprotected.

Marta Corredera playing for Spain's history making team at the 2019 Women's World Cup.

""In any situation of unemployment, injury, including maternity, Spanish female footballers didn't have that law that protected them. Now with this new agreement we've taken a step forward in that regard, that players feel secure and, above all, valued for what they are doing as their job.""

The association of clubs (ACFF) and several players' unions had been locked in negotiations over the league's collective bargaining agreement for almost 18 months, until an agreement was finally reached at the end of February.

Much of the delay was down to the ACFF refusing to meet the wage demands for part-time players, which it proposed should have been €8,000 ($9,000) instead of the €12,000 ($13,600) that was eventually agreed on.

The stall in negotiations forced the players to take drastic action.

In November, the footballers boycotted all eight first division matches during one gameweek, after 189 representatives from the league's 16 clubs voted 93% in favor of taking strike action.

""We all know well that when the population mobilizes is when people realize that things need to change,"" Corredera says. ""We had been asking for this agreement for some time, for them to confirm it and come to an agreement.

""I think clubs as well as the association didn't think that the players would come together and strike. We showed that strength of everyone together and being united was what helped open people's eyes and show that we were serious, that really wanted this agreement and would do everything we possibly could to achieve it.""

The strike convinced the clubs to reopen negotiations as they successfully sought funding from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) -- which pays clubs €350,000 ($397,000) per season -- and through a television rights deal to meet the players' demands.

Closing the gap

For Corredera, the new deal caps off a startling rise for Spanish women's football, both domestically and internationally.

The versatile winger left Spain in 2015 to play for Arsenal in the Women's Super League and won both the FA Cup and WSL Cup during her time in England.

France's top tier is widely considered the best in Europe, though arguably the talent is far more concentrated at the top of the division compared to larger spread in England's WSL.

Lyon has dominated the Champions League in recent seasons, winning the last four editions, while French clubs have made up five of the last eight finalists.

However, Spain had its breakthrough year in the competition last season as Barcelona became the first Spanish club in Champions League history to reach either the semifinals or the final.

Barcelona became the first Spanish team to reach either the semifinal or final or the Champions League.

Though Barcelona eventually lost 4-1 to Lyon, Correrdera believes it's evidence that the gap is closing between Spain and its rival European leagues; indeed, the country is guaranteed another semifinalist with Barca and Atletico Madrid facing off in this season's quarterfinals.

""It's completely different now than it was before,"" she says of the league's quality. ""Above all, the level of the players, the level of the matches have increased a lot.

""The matches are a lot more difficult to win because the level of the players has grown. This is down to the fact they are training a lot better, there are trainers, fitness coaches that are more prepared, that understand and work with the female body because we are different (to men).

""Thanks to the clubs, the federation, our whole environment, we're improving. Television is supporting us a lot more and people see us more in their homes, people go to games more. We're more visible and started to have more significance in society.

""We all know that those leagues have been working for many years on a good trajectory and that gives them an advantage over us, but I think we're getting closer to those countries and leagues because here in Spain we're working really well.

""That's cut the distance, we need to carry on like this and the generations that are coming up are also making their mark and I think that will help us achieve success in the present or near future.""

Corredera has lofty ambitions this season both at club and international level.

Her Levante side, which she says has the perfect blend of youth and experience, sits in third place in the league -- just five points behind Atletico Madrid in second -- and is dreaming of qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2009.

Marta Corredera goes past the USWNT's Megan Rapinoe during the She Believes Cup clash.

Corredera was part of the Spain squad at last summer's Women's World Cup that made history with the country's first ever appearance in the knockout stages.

The national team has since gone from strength to strength and earned an invitation to this year's She Believes Cup, the annual four-team tournament held in the United States.

Spain secured an impressive 3-1 against Japan in the opening match, totally dominating the 2011 World Cup winner, before narrowly losing 1-0 to reigning world champion the USWNT.

Corredera and her teammates go into Wednesday's deciding matches with an outside chance of winning the title; they'll need to secure victory against a strong England team and hope that Japan can upset the US.

""The She Believes Cup is a tournament we've always watched from a distance and now we have the luck to be able to enjoy it ourselves,"" she says.

""We need to try to learn and above all enjoy the experience, compete at our maximum and achieve good results because I think this team is capable of doing that.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_football/~3/biZ9RdrZr8U/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE
['George Ramsay'],"(CNN) The Premier League has entered new territory as the game between Manchester City and Arsenal was postponed to become the first-top flight English fixture to be affected by the novel coronavirus outbreak.

The match was due to be played Wednesday, but the league said that the postponement was a ""precautionary measure"" after Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis tested positive for the virus.

It said the risk of them developing the virus was ""extremely low"" but that individuals who met Marinakis were self-isolating at home for 14 days in line with government guidance. The 14-day period ends on Friday.

['Matias Grez'],"(CNN) Outplayed, outgunned and outcoached, Jose Mourinho was powerless to stop his Totttenham side suffering a Champions League exit at the hands of RB Leipzig.

Mourinho lamented his injury crisis after the first leg , describing the defeat as going into ""a gunfight without bullets.""

On Tuesday, Mourinho didn't even have the luxury of turning up to the second leg with an empty gun.

Leipzig was again totally dominant for 90 minutes, only this time it took advantage with two early goals to seal a 3-0 win courtesy of captain Marcel Sabitzer's brace and Emil Forsberg late strike.

With just two draws and four defeats from his last six matches, Mourinho is currently suffering the longest winless streak of his 935-match managerial career and is without a win in the Champions League knockout stages for six years.

""I was very positive yesterday and that's the way I have to be all the time, if I'm not positive it's better not to come to the game,"" a philosophical Mourinho told BT Sport after the match. ""Yes I'm positive, I motivate the players and yes we all believed but we know that in this moment (with injuries) it's all very difficult.

Jose Mourinho was powerless to prevent his Tottenham side crashing out of Europe.

""They are a very, very strong side ... and after our first couple of mistakes they score and the game of course is very, very difficult. They deserved to go through, they were the best team. If I can be critical, I keep it for us. Sometimes difficult moments are moments that can prepare the future in a better way.

""Of course there is nobody to blame when it looks like we have a traumatic injury and every traumatic injury ends with months and months (out). It's very hard and the players they gave everything. People can say 'excuses' but I'm pretty sure it's bad for anyone and I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation.""

Tottenham was lucky to come away from that first leg just one goal behind after RB Leipzig dominated for the vast majority of the match.

Aside from a late flurry of attacks in the closing stages, Spurs spent most of the game on the back foot -- but the opening 10 minutes of the second leg very much reflected the closing 10 minutes of the first.

Mourinho appeared to set out his side in far more attacking fashion; the forward trio of Erik Lamelo, Dele Alli and Lucas Moura were snapping at the heels of Leipzig's defenders and looked lively every time they streamed forward.

However, Julian Nagelsmann's Leipzig is a sight to behold when attacking at full tilt, and in the blink of an eye had turned defense into attack to double its advantage on aggregate.

On a trademark blistering counterattack, Leipzig's first of the match, star striker Timo Werner reacted quickest to his blocked shot and laid the loose ball off to Sabitzer on the edge of the area.

The captain hit a low first time shot that Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris got a hand to but couldn't keep out.

Marcel Sabitzer celebrates after scoring his opening goal.

And if there were question marks over Lloris failed attempt at a save for the first goal, alarm bells were ringing for the second.

It was Sabitzer again with the goal, turning Angelino's cross in at the near post with his head. Lloris was once again well positioned and got a strong hand to the ball, but once again failed to prevent the goal.

Deja vu?

Given the Spurs now needed three away goals to progress to the next round, it would seem remiss to not talk about last season's comeback from the same position against Ajax in the semifinals.

On that famous night in Amsterdam, Tottenham did indeed find the three second-half goals it needed to progress to the final, though any lingering hopes of deja vu in Leipzig were quickly dispelled in the second half.

The host was utterly dominant, sucking the life out of what were now weary Tottenham legs and tired heads.

Leipzig did eventually put the Spurs out of its misery with just three minutes remaining, as Forsberg reacted first to a loose ball and poked home with his first touch since coming on as a substitute just seconds earlier.

For a club playing in the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in its history, Leipzig already looks well and truly at home.

Seven goals, no fans

In the night's other match, Valencia and Atalanta shared seven goals between them -- and 12 overall on aggregate -- but sadly there were no fans to witness it.

Last week, it was announced that the match would be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak, as Spain's health ministry said it wanted to avoid ""large gatherings of fans.""

Valencia and Atalanta played their match in front of empty stands.

Leading 4-1 from the first leg, Atalanta -- appearing in the Champions League for the first time in its history -- scored an early opening goal through Josip Ilicic's penalty to end the game as a contest, but it certainly didn't end it as a spectacle.

When Kevin Gameiro equalized on the night for the host, there was an audible roar from the Valencia fans that were gathered outside the stadium to watch the match.

In fairness to the stadium announcer, he lacked no enthusiasm when announcing Gameiro as the goalscorer over the speaker system.

Another five goals were scored, including a hat-trick for Ilicic, as Atalanta ran out 4-3 winner on the night and 8-4 on aggregate.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_football/~3/caMEBTiVUZg/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE
['Matias Grez'],"(CNN) The Juventus players gathered in the center of the pitch and jokingly applauded the empty stands.

Juve's 2-0 win over Inter Milan was one of the biggest matches in Serie A this season and a potentially defining result in the race for the Scudetto, but nobody was at the Allianz Stadium in Turin to witness it.

Italy is the European country hardest hit by the novel coronavirus and is still struggling to get the outbreak under control; there are now more than 7,300 cases in the country and 366 deaths.

Authorities took extraordinary measures this weekend by locking down much of the north of the country in an attempt to stop the virus spreading, restricting travel for more than 15 million people.

Inter Milan and Juventus players compete in an empty stadium due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

While the large-scale quarantine only affects the north, other restrictions have been placed on the rest of the country -- schools, university classes, theaters and cinemas, bars, nightclubs and sports events have all been suspended.

As defending champion Woods gets to host and choose the menu for the exclusive pre-tournament gathering of past winners and the Augusta National chairman on the Tuesday of Masters week. The food is usually revealed just days before the tournament's start as the world's best golfers gather at Augusta, with this year's Masters' starting on April 9.

The 44-year-old won his fifth Masters green jacket and first major since 2008 in a remarkable comeback last year and has echoed the menu from his fourth Augusta win in 2006.

Some might think there was a higher power at work when Tiger Woods strode down the first hole at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles Thursday.

Close to where basketball great Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash last month, Woods fizzed his second shot into the green to leave an eagle putt of 24 feet eight inches.

Remarkably, those are the two jersey numbers worn by Bryant during his glittering 20-year career with the LA Lakers.

Of course, Woods made the putt.

""It's ironic, isn't it?"" Woods told the Golf Channel afterwards. ""I didn't know about the putt being that long.""

Justin Thomas wore bespoke shoes in honor of NBA star Kobe Bryant.

In a scorching start, the former world No.1 also birdied the fifth and the par-four eighth hole, where the flag and signage were in the yellow and purple livery of the Lakers.

It's also where Woods mimicked a basketball shot as he tossed his ball back to caddie Joe LaCava.

Several other players also paid tribute to Bryant during the first round of the Genesis Invitational.

World No.1 Rory McIlroy sported a set of Lakers headcovers on his woods with the numbers 24 and 8 and the words ""Mamba mentality"" in a nod to Bryant's nickname ""Black Mamba.""

Brooks Koepka, who McIlroy overtook at the top of the standings, also had Lakers headcovers, while Justin Thomas wore a pair of custom-made golf shoes in Lakers colors bearing Bryant's image.

""No matter what we do, I think for a while we're going to always remember Kobe and what he meant, especially here in SoCal and the entire sports world,"" Woods added.

"['Calum Trenaman', 'For Cnn']","(CNN) The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) is the latest sports organization to take action against the spread of coronavirus after it canceled two upcoming tournaments in Thailand and Singapore.

The LPGA had already canceled the prestigious Blue Bay event that was scheduled to take place March 5 to 8, on Hainan Island in southern China.

The 2020 Honda LPGA Thailand, which was scheduled to take place between February 20-23 in Pattaya, Thailand, has now been canceled alongside the 2020 HSBC Women's World Championship, which was scheduled to take place between February 27 to March 1 in Singapore.

Due to the continued health concerns and recent advisories surrounding the coronavirus in some Asian countries, the LPGA and its partners have made the decision to cancel the 2020 Honda LPGA Thailand and the 2020 HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore. RELEASE ⬇️

'Difficult decision'

In an official statement, the LGPA said: ""It is always a difficult decision to cancel events and the LPGA greatly appreciates the understanding and all the efforts made by our title sponsors (Honda and HSBC) as well as IMG to host incredible events for our players.

""The health and safety of our players, fans and everyone working on the event is always our highest priority.

""While we are disappointed that these tournaments will not take place this season, we look forward to returning to Asia soon.""

The coronavirus has infected 40,000 people and killed 910 people globally since its outbreak in Wuhan, China.

Sporting events canceled or under threat

A number of sporting events in China have been canceled, postponed or moved to other countries since the outbreak began and many like the Formula One Shanghai Grand Prix remain under threat.

However, the cancellation of these golf tournaments mark the latest examples of sports events outside of China being affected by the coronavirus:",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/Wvss6BuQw2M/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE
['John Sinnott'],"(CNN) Golf has it's fair share of conservative traditions, but the Vic Open in Australia shows that the sport is also capable of innovating.

Both male and female professionals played in alternate groups over two courses at the 13th Beach Golf Links in Geelong, with equal prize money of $1,100,000 on offer for both men and women. It's the one event on the LPGA and European Tour schedule where this happens.

Min Woo Lee won the men's tournament, while South Korea's Park Hee-young claimed the women's title following a playoff.

""The Vic Open should open people's eyes to the fact that our game is full of amazing golf talent,"" former US Open winner Geoff Ogilvy, who was competing in Geelong, wrote on the LPGA website.

""It also proves that women and men playing together can work. Tennis has been doing it for years and has clearly benefited from it. There are certain major tennis championships where the women's final draw more eyes than the men.

['Analysis Rob Hodgetts'],"(CNN) The genie is out of the bottle. Tiger Woods' son Charlie plays golf and his swing looks sweet.

The 10-year-old was filmed hitting balls on a practice range ahead of a junior tournament in Florida, with his dad standing behind him. Woods Sr. was later pictured caddying for his son.

The video, taken from a distance, set social media abuzz. Firstly, because Charlie is clearly a chip off the old block when it comes to golf.

But perhaps more importantly it sparked a debate on the ethics of circulating a video of a child, seemingly without permission. And it highlights the tricky world of Woods.

Tiger Woods celebrates with son Charlie after winning the Masters in 2019.

'I don't like fame'

On the one hand, Woods wants his kids -- Charlie has an older sister Sam -- to have as close as possible to a normal life, such as competing in junior golf tournaments, or going to soccer practice with friends, which the 44-year-old often references in news conferences.

But as one of the most famous sports stars on the planet, with a blockbuster back story, Woods knows he is the focus of intense scrutiny.

He hates that consequence of success, telling CNN in November of his attitude to fame, ""I don't like it. I never have liked it."" Which probably explains why his superyacht is named ""Privacy.""

So when one of Woods' children shows talent at golf, perhaps unsurprisingly given their dad's 15 majors and status as arguably the best of all time, the spotlight is likely to swing in their direction.

For all the controversy that surrounded Woods following the sex scandal that led to divorce, he has always remained devoted to his children and worked hard to keep them out of the limelight.

During their early childhood it was relatively easy, and for a number of years recently, Woods was out of the scene himself given his catalogue of back injuries.

But during Woods' comeback year in 2018 following spine fusion surgery, he admitted he wanted to show his growing kids that golf was more than just the ""pain"" it appeared to inflict on their dad and that he wasn't just an old golfer on YouTube

Sam and Charlie were present at Carnoustie in Scotland to see their father close to emulating his glory days as he briefly led the Open Championship. And they were at the center of the flashbulbs again at Augusta last April as Woods clinched that remarkable 15th major and first since 2008.

""It means the world to me just to have them there, and then now to have them see their Pops win, just like my Pops saw me win here, it's pretty special,"" he said afterwards, referring to his father Earl who died in 2006, the year after Woods won his fourth Masters.

On those occasions, Woods would have been well aware the children would have featured on TV and been snapped by photographers.

But unlike child prodigies, such as himself, publicly promoted from an early age by Earl and first on TV at the age of two, or Rory McIlroy, who featured on a Northern Ireland talk show chipping golf balls into a washing machine when he was nine years old, Charlie Woods' recent appearance was no PR set up.

Tiger would have known his presence with his son on a packed driving range was likely to attract attention. But the reaction to the video will arguably give him pause for thought as he weighs up the best way to allow his kids to enjoy a normal life.

Some will also argue there was no harm in the video. It was, after all, a genuine ""wow"" moment as the world saw for the first time Charlie's prowess with his dad watching on.

Woods is likely to be asked about it when he makes his first start of the season at Torrey Pines in California next week. The answer, or lack thereof, could be illuminating.

As for Charlie, it's great he's got some of his dad's skills. But at 10, that's largely irrelevant for now. Golf may only ever be a hobby for him.

Perhaps Tiger's greatest influence will come in managing the exposure and helping his son come to terms with the price of a famous dad.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/SI8MiGrHYY0/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE
['Rob Hodgetts'],"(CNN) It began as a battle of the bodies, but now golf's alpha male Brooks Koepka has gone for the jugular.

The world No. 1 slapped down fellow American Bryson DeChambeau's attempts at body banter with a well-aimed blow at a European Tour event in Abu Dhabi this week.

DeChambeau mused to his followers during a Fortnite Twitch stream Wednesday that Koepka's gym-sculpted physique was less than perfect.

""I don't know if his genetics even make him look good, to be honest with you,"" said DeChambeau, who has embarked on a intensive program to beef up since last season.

Referring to Koepka's naked spread in ESPN's Body Issue last year, he added: ""In the Body Issue he didn't have any abs. I got some abs.""

The pair, who both played on the 2018 United States Ryder Cup team, appeared together in a promotional photo shoot ahead of the Abu Dhabi tournament.

They both wore white lab coats, with Koepka holding a dumbbell and DeChambeau sporting safety specs and clutching a chemistry-type beaker in a nod to his ""scientist"" persona.

However, after the first round Thursday, Koepka fired his barb.

['Rob Hodgetts'],"(CNN) The reports trickled in, vague and confused at first. There had been some sort of car crash. Tiger Woods was involved. He might be injured.

Fears at first for the health of one of sport's biggest stars, maybe the biggest. Then news of a collision with a fire hydrant and a tree yards from Woods' Florida home, a golf club, a smashed car window, rumors of a row with wife Elin. The trickle became a torrent, as intrigue, gossip and speculation spread like wildfire around the world.

That infamous night 10 years ago this week changed everything. For golf, for sport, for Woods' legend and most of all for Woods' family.

He was, after all, the man who had taken golf into a new realm. His skill, his power, his dedication to fitness, his work ethic and strong values, his mental strength, and his fortitude in blazing a trail as a black man in a white sport, had turned him into a global superstar.

He'd won 14 major golf titles in 11 years and was just four behind the record of the great Jack Nicklaus . And though slowed by knee surgery after his remarkable 2008 US Open title win, Woods seemed destined to roar right past his countryman. Corporate America couldn't get enough.

But there would be price for that success and Woods was about to pay big time.

Tiger Woods crashed his SUV into a fire hydrant and a tree near his Florida home on November 27 2009.

Sadness

Ironically, it was the fire hydrant which ignited the smouldering tabloid tales into an full-blown inferno. Before, Woods' narrative had looked clear. After, nothing was clear any more.

First, there was the statement admitting his ""transgressions"" and saying he had ""let my family down.""

A number of sponsors such as Gillette, Accenture and AT&T cut ties with Woods and he announced an ""indefinite"" break from golf.

Then there was the stay at a Mississippi addiction clinic, and the embarrassment of a mea culpa press conference at the PGA Tour headquarters in Florida.

""I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated,"" he told a select group of friends and family -- his mother Kultida was sitting in the front row -- as well as the world's media.

Woods admitted his actions were ""not acceptable,"" and that he had ""stopped living by the core values"" he was taught by his parents.""I knew my actions were wrong, but I convinced myself that normal rules didn't apply,"" he said.

There was the return to golf at the Masters, where he earned a stern rebuke from Augusta National chairman Billy Payne, who used a press conference to say Woods ""disappointed all of us.""

Despite attempts to patch up his marriage, divorce from Elin followed later that year. There was the plummeting form, the swing tinkering, coach and caddie changes, a climb back to world No.1 in 2013, before serious short game yips.

There was also a growing list of injuries, leading to four back operations including spinal fusion surgery, the ""dark times"" where the pain was so bad he couldn't even get out of bed, or play with his kids, and fears for his future quality of life let alone his top-level golf career.

There were the aborted comebacks, the line leaked from a Masters Champions Dinner where Woods admitted his career was ""done,"" the world ranking plunging outside the top 1,100, the arrest on a DUI charge and an addiction to painkillers used to treat his back.

A police mugshot showing a haggard and puffy-looking Woods provided graphic evidence of just how bad things had got. This wasn't how the story was supposed to end.

Tiger Woods' police mugshot after he was arrested in May 2017.

Gripped

But as Woods' rehabilitation from surgery continued, the reports trickled in. And on social media this time. Talk of Woods practising again, videos of him chipping, then hitting full shots.

Early into his comeback in 2018 the signs were promising. This one looked more sustainable. There was a groundswell, too, that the new Woods was a more open, more approachable figure than the aloof iceman at the height of his powers. The water under the bridge seemed to have eased the tension. A burgeoning friendship with long-time fierce rival Phil Mickelson was testament.

When Woods briefly took the lead in the British Open at Carnoustie, the crowd's excitement made the Scottish air fizz with electricity.

Woods was greeted on the final green by his kids Sam and Charlie, who were finally getting a taste of their doting dad near the height of his powers, rather than just as a ""YouTube golfer,"" as he put it.

The following month Woods was the main challenger to Brooks Koepka, finishing second in the US PGA Championship. The scenes of a stampeding mass following Woods as he strode to victory in the season-ending Tour Championship in Atlanta were like a movie clip from his heyday.

It was his first win in five years and a remarkable achievement given his medical history. Questions quickly followed as to whether Woods could win another major. Even so, catching Nicklaus still seemed a stretch.

And then came the Masters this year. Augusta has always brought the best out of Woods, ever since he announced himself on the world stage with a first major title there in 1997. With Woods in contention, the roars reverberating around the Georgia pines on Sunday afternoon were loaded with extra expectation.

The world of sport was gripped. He couldn't, could he?

"['Nick Friend', 'For Cnn']","(CNN) It was never meant to happen. And yet, it did. It was the major victory many had long since accepted would never happen again -- 3,955 days after his last major triumph.

Since Tiger Woods won the 2008 US Open at Torrey Pines, 31 different players have claimed golf's big four. And as he holed the putt that brought to an unlikely end a drought that few had foreseen and even fewer foresaw being broken, the 15-time major winner crept one step closer to Jack Nicklaus' unrivaled 18 titles. Fourteen years after his last Masters win, it represented the longest ever gap between victories at Augusta. At 43, Woods became the oldest champion since Nicklaus himself.

It has been a most curious battle for golf's ultimate statistical supremacy; when Woods won his 14th major as a 32-year-old -- all of which had been collected within a 11-year golden streak -- there seemed little doubt that Woods would not just surpass Nicklaus -- The Golden Bear -- but fly past his personal record in such a way that there would be no possible debate around the sport's greatest player.

As it is, though, Nicklaus remains the man in possession. Nobody has claimed more major wins and, until Francesco Molinari located the treacherous water on Augusta's famed Golden Bell 12th hole, it seemed that his tally would remain unchallenged.

"['Don Riddell', 'Ben Church']","(CNN) PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka has set his sights on a period of domination after securing his fourth major title at Bethpage Sunday .

The 29-year-old retained the Wanamaker Trophy to become the first player to win his first four majors inside two years and he is confident he has more to offer.

""Double digits, easy! I don't see why I can't get to double digits,"" he told CNN Sport's Don Riddell when asked how many majors he can win during his career.

""I got four now, I'm 29, and they say you don't peak until you're in your thirties. So, hopefully, I peak then.""

'I wasn't afraid'

The Floridan was in a league of his own for most of this year's PGA Championship , going into the final day with a healthy lead of seven shots.

Despite a late surge from close friend Dustin Johnson, Koepka managed to hold his nerve to win with two shots to spare.

""I was up against the ropes, it wasn't easy. It wasn't fun,"" he said, describing his mini-meltdown when he dropped four straight shots on the last day.

In @BKoepka, I see a positive, determined young man who knows where he wants to go in his career. He wants to win big tournaments, win majors; prepares well for them; obviously has his way of doing things & it's been successful. No reason why we won't see more of this from Brooks — Jack Nicklaus (@jacknicklaus) May 20, 2019

""I wasn't afraid. I mean I always had a lead, so what's there to be afraid of.""

If anything, the pressure made the win that bit sweeter.

Despite two US Open titles and a PGA Championship already to his name, Koepka struggled to contain a rare show of emotion on the 18th green.

""It was special. To see that putt drop it was absolutely incredible,"" he said after clinching the win.

""The emotion I had was something I've never experienced as a golfer, something you don't see very often, even with me.

""I'm emotionless, I can be stoic at times but that one meant more to me than I think people will ever know.""

The new Tiger?

Following his impressive display, Koepka's name is now being mentioned in the same breath as greats such as Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.

It's a comparison that Koepka can scarcely believe, having watched his heroes dominate the sport while he was busy working his way through the ranks.

He now looks a fitting heir to Woods' long-term throne having beaten the Masters champion by 17 shots after two rounds.

However, any chance of Koepka beating Woods' record of 10 major trophies before the age of 30 has long past.

""If somebody had said that I'd be mentioned with any of those names, I'd have just laughed at you,"" said Koepka.

""It's very humbling. You see the appreciation that everybody has for those guys and what they've accomplished in their careers and how great their careers have been.

""To even put my name with theirs is incredible.""

Koepka has been compared to fellow American Tiger Woods after his fourth major win.

Getting credit he deserves

Despite setting numerous records, the American's rise has gone somewhat under the radar with his domineering style perhaps not getting the credit it deserves.

Unlike the short bursts of success enjoyed by the likes of Rory McIlroy -- whose four titles came in just over three years -- Koepka's previous three major wins have blended into the background, much like Koepka himself.

Often deadpan in interviews and steely faced out on the course, the American publicly admits to having a chip on his shoulder

A muscle-bound Koepka only took up golf after a car accident ended his dreams of making it in baseball, basketball and other more athletic sports.

However, he is now keen to show the world who he really is.

""I'm still finding me. I'm trying to be who I truly am, I'm not trying to please anybody else anymore,"" he said.

""I'm not trying to bite my tongue or sit back and just go about my business. I want to be me, I want to be who I truly am and I think you see a lot of who I am on the golf course.

""I viewed the media as an enemy and now I'm viewing it differently. Trying to use it as an outlet has been quite humbling, to say the least.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/tzQ4mUsZ6kg/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE
['Rob Hodgetts'],"Portrush, Northern Ireland (CNN) It was his to lose, but Ireland's Shane Lowry had no intention of letting the Claret Jug slip from his grasp as he romped to victory in the Open at Royal Portrush for his first major title.

The 32-year-old weathered difficult conditions and the pressure of holding onto a sizeable overnight lead to beat England's Tommy Fleetwood by six strokes, with American Tony Finau third.

Lowry had become the crowd favorite since Northern Ireland's stars fell out of contention , and he rode their raucous support to surge clear with that course-record 63 Saturday before a battling 72 Sunday to end 15 under.

He becomes only the second player from Ireland to win a major after Padraig Harrington won three between 2007 and 2008, kickstarting a remarkable period of success for golfers from both sides of the border.

Shane Lowry celebrates after holing the winning putt at Royal Portrush.

Feverish fans

The world No.33's previous best major finish was second in the US Open in 2016 after he blew a four-shot lead going into the final day.

But not this time.

Despite having missed the cut in his last four Opens, Lowry seemed impervious to the periods of lashing rain, fierce gusts and expectation, both from within and from the feverish fans, who roared him onto and off every green and tee.

In tandem with caddie Brian ""Bo"" Martin he plotted his way around Portrush's celebrated Dunluce links, offering no opportunities for the chasing pack and keeping his head when he made mistakes.

Or so it seemed.

""I kept telling Bo how nervous I was, how scared I was, how I didn't want to mess it up,"" said Lowry, who revealed a key talk with his coach Neil Manchip at Bushmills on the eve of the tournament convinced him he was good enough to contend.

Despite a bogey at the first he edged clear to lead by six after seven holes and again after 10 and 15.

It had become a two-horse race with Fleetwood, who also had plenty of support given his European Ryder Cup heroics, but one in which the second runner was lagging from the off.

Fleetwood was also chasing his first major title after a runner-up spot in the 2018 US Open, but he just couldn't get close enough to rattle Lowry.

""He's everyone's son in Ireland today,"" said former European Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance on TV commentary.

Smiling and with his hands thrust in his body-warmer pockets, Lowry junior walked up to the lofty 18th tee with a six-shot lead and the European Ryder Cup chant ""ole, ole, ole"" ringing all around him.

His drive bisected the fairway and he blew out his cheeks and looked up into the sky.

If the reception for Rory McIlroy after his valiant attempt to make the cut Friday had been emotional, the wall of noise that greeted Lowry was thunderous and jubilant.

When his second shot found the green he raised both arms and hugged Martin, finally unlocking a full beaming grin that lit up the otherwise gloomy Portrush afternoon.

""I couldn't believe it was happening to me, I tried to soak it in but it was surreal,"" he told reporters later in his press conference.

Shane Lowry cradles the Claret Jug for winning the Open.

'Amazing'

When Lowry stroked in the winning putt he he was greeted by wife Wendy and his young daughter Iris on the 18th green, before hugs for the rest of his family and friends.

""Wow,"" said Lowry after accepting the Claret Jug. ""To have an Open at Royal Portrush on the island of Ireland is just amazing.""

His eyes filled and his voice cracked as he added: ""My mum and dad sacrificed so much for me and I'm just glad I can hand them this trophy tonight.""

He was also hugged by Harrington and Portrush local Graeme McDowell, whose success as the 2010 US Open winner played its part in the Open returning to Northern Ireland for the first time in 68 years. Portrush resident Darren Clarke's 2011 Open win and McIlroy's four majors from 2011-2014 were also instrumental, once the specter of Northern Ireland's Troubles receded.

Lowry won his first European Tour event when still an amateur at the Irish Open in 2009 and clinched the last of his four titles in Abu Dhabi in January.

On his way to missing the cut at the Open last year, he sat in the car park at Carnoustie and cried.

"['Don Riddell', 'For Cnn']","(CNN) Tony Jacklin is a hero. I think every golf fan in Europe would agree with that.

He's a two-time major winner, the first man ever to hold both the Open Championship and the US Open at the same time and before Tony came along, the Ryder Cup was a biennial reminder of America's golfing supremacy.

Everything changed, though, when he helped expand the Britain and Ireland team to become European, first captaining them in 1983. He inspired them to challenge the USA, establishing a winning mentality that has continued -- almost uninterrupted -- ever since.

Before his captaincy, the Americans had won it on 20 occasions out of 24; since then, Europe has won or tied it a dozen times out of 18.

As a result, the Ryder Cup is one of my favorite sports events, but I am just a little conflicted.

Here's why: Tony Jacklin is also the man who tarnished my Mum's wedding!

Boyhood hero

Growing up as a young boy in Edinburgh, I often heard about the exploits of Scottish sports stars like the footballer Kenny Dalglish and the Olympic sprint champion Alan Wells, but the Englishman Jacklin was the first one I can truly remember.

The stories around the family dinner table specifically revolved around his victory at The Open Championship in 1969.

Fifty years ago, on July 12, Jacklin won the Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes and it was a really big deal for British golf.

That same day was also a big deal for my family; some 200 miles further north, Norman Riddell and Leila White said ""I do"" at the Murrayfield Parish Church in Edinburgh. Since it was a day that would change all of their lives, I can only imagine the excitement they would have been feeling that morning.

Jacklin told me, ""in our business, major championships are it. I knew as a young man that if I won a major championship then I'd never be forgotten.""

Ryder Cup European team captain Tony Jacklin (right) celebrates with Seve Ballesteros (left) and Sam Torrance (centre).

These days, major championships are settled on Sunday afternoons, but in 1969 the Open still finished on Saturday. Jacklin teed off in his final round with a two-stroke lead. ""I was pretty tough mentally,"" he recalled.

""I'd won in Jacksonville the previous year, playing on the last day with Arnold Palmer. His fans were known as 'Arnie's Army' and they didn't care much about anybody except him.""

Jacklin says that experience stood him in good stead. ""There was a real sense of expectation in the UK that summer.""

The 1968 Open champion concurred. Gary Player told me that ""Britain was starving for a major championship winner, the last one had been Max Faulkner in 1951, a gap of 18 years. Tony's win gave British golf such a spurt.""

By the 18th hole, Jacklin says all that anticipation had turned into celebration. ""What a corker!"" cried the television commentator Henry Longhurst, describing Jacklin's final tee shot. As he marched up the fairway, Jacklin even lost his shoe in the rush of fans surging forward to congratulate him.

Happy couple

By then, my young parents had already walked up and back down the aisle and were enjoying their reception at the Ellersly House Hotel.

Norman and Leila Riddell on their wedding day.

I should point out that this was all happening at one of the most momentous periods in human history; just four days later, Apollo 11 would blast off from The Kennedy Space Center and the following Sunday, Neil Armstrong was taking one small, but historic, step.

Despite that extraordinary feat of technological innovation, watching a sports event on television was very difficult. Cabling golf courses for broadcast was so expensive that Jacklin would often play events where only the last three holes were televised -- in fact, that's how he became the first golfer ever to score a televised hole-in-one. He aced the 16th at the 1967 Dunlop Masters.

My Uncle Jim White, one of the biggest sports fans in the family, reminded me that in 1969 there were no smart phones, no Internet and no video recorders to record pictures that were only just being televised in color. As my uncle put it, ""the color was so badly represented that I thought for a number of years big Jack Nicklaus had an orange face!""

So, he hadn't seen any of the golf in the first three rounds; the best he could do was follow the action via the ""stop press"" margin of the Edinburgh Evening News on the bus home from work.

For all the sports fans at the reception that afternoon, it must have been irresistible; the magnetic pull of an historic sports moment, even if it was only being shown on a small, grainy, black and white screen. By all accounts, the male guests packed into the room while the bride and her friends were left to chat among themselves in an adjacent room. It was, apparently, like the parting of the Red Sea.

My mum isn't much of a sports fan, and she has no recollection of Jacklin's big moment -- her only view was a gallery of male backs and people leaping about, trying to get a better sight of the tiny screen. That is a vivid memory however, I've heard about it often!

British golfer Tony Jacklin on 14th April 1968.

Overshadowing the big day

Half a century later, my parents still disagree about Jacklin's '69 achievement. To my father, his triumph was ""a feature of the wedding."" When I told my Mum that I'd spoken to Jacklin about this article, she texted ""Has he apologized?""

I don't think she was joking either, lamenting later ""It was disappointing. That's not quite how I imagined my wedding day would have turned out.""

I'm sure that her story is not unique and in fact, the advent of technology has almost certainly made sport and wedding conflicts even more problematic in the intervening years. And whilst many people might have sympathy with her, professional golfers do not.

Player laughed when I mentioned it, ""I think golf does ruin a lot of days, whether it's a funeral or the birth of a child."" Player still regrets that he missed the birth of his first daughter.

Norman and Leila Riddell with the rest of their family on their wedding day.

I suppose it was a less than auspicious start to their married life and unfortunately things didn't improve much on their honeymoon. The Scottish weather was unseasonable for July (it was scorching) and the newlyweds got so badly sunburnt on Loch Faskally that they couldn't bear to be touched for a week.

Jacklin also had a stressful 'honeymoon."" He told me that he wanted to take a break in order to ""contemplate the changes in my life. I wasn't just 'a golfer' anymore.""

But his agent had other plans, instructing him that the next tournament was the biggest prize in golf, the Westchester Classic and he ""couldn't miss it.""

What should have been a joyous time for Jacklin was anything but; he missed the next four cuts and was brought crashing down to earth. ""He ran me ragged, I was a pioneer in many respects; I was flying by the seat of my pants.""

His agent was Mark McCormack and these were the early days of IMG. ""I came to realize it wasn't about me, it was all about him.""

Tony Jacklin made just £4,250 pounds ($5,386) for winning the Open in 1969; he scoffs as he accurately recalls the exact amount.

These days, the winner is handed a cheque for almost $2 million. In 1969, my parents' wedding reception cost 149 pounds, 14 shillings and 8 pence; The Scotsman newspaper reported this year that the average cost of a wedding in Scotland is more than $45,000. How times have changed.

Happy memories

This month, all are reflecting fondly on a day they will never forget, from half a century ago.

The following summer, Jacklin went on to win the US Open at Hazeltine and for a span of 84 years, he was the only European player to have won it. He was arguably defined by his glory years in the Ryder Cup and his legacy is a golf course that he built with Nicklaus in Florida.

""The Concession"" memorializes a crucial putt that Nicklaus conceded to Jacklin in the 1969 Ryder Cup. It was a sporting gesture that halved not only the hole, but their match and the cup itself. As they shook hands, Nicklaus famously said ""I knew you wouldn't have missed, but I didn't want to give you the chance.""

I mentioned my parents' story to Nicklaus recently; ""I hope they have a nice 50th and celebrate right along and have a glass of champagne with Tony,"" he said, warmly.

Norman and Leila Riddell were successful in their own way, raising three sons with five grandchildren. Whilst I wasn't there to see it, I'll never think of their wedding day as tarnished or spoiled or ruined, or anything remotely negative -- although it has been a fun story and my privilege to tell. How could it have been bad when so much good has come from it?

Norman and Leila Riddell cut the cake on their wedding day.

Marriage isn't easy and until now I've only ever personally known two couples which have successfully made it to fifty years. I'm very proud of them.

Jacklin says that whilst he has one or two regrets, he's very content with his life's work; but he isn't quite as excited by my story as I am. ""I've had lots of people tell me over the years that it was a memorable day to them because of a wedding or the birth of a child. It's kind of nice to be remembered for that.""

So this particular wedding wasn't special to Tony Jacklin, but my Uncle -- who gave my mum away that day, disagrees: ""Leila and Norman have had their golden years, but, like Tony, they've had to work hard. That day spun magic for all of us.""",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/LRF6j-2Wa44/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE
['Rob Hodgetts'],"(CNN) The back pain was excruciating at times, but nothing like the shame.

Tiger Woods had built his own legacy and then knocked it down himself. The awkward public confession of serial infidelity. The police mugshot and videos of a bloated, dazed and confused Woods after his arrest for driving under the influence

He knew, deep down, he was one of the greats, but his kids could only guess.

Woods was desperate to show them what the old man could do -- had done -- but his ailing body wouldn't let him. Even that may have been partly his fault after his punishing weights and fitness regime and fixation on US Navy Seal training, as revealed by former coach Hank Haney in his book ""The Big Miss.""

Woods had plenty of injuries before, including multiple knee rebuilds, but he returned from those. But the back was threatening to take him down. At times, he says, he couldn't walk, couldn't sit, couldn't lie down. He missed golf, but most of all he missed playing and fooling around with his children, Sam and Charlie. Of his career, they knew him only as a star on YouTube.

But after an epic Sunday at Augusta, Woods fulfilled two dreams. To get back to the top of a game he had dominated for so long, and to make his kids proud.

""It means the world to me just to have them there, and then now to have them see their Pops win, just like my Pops saw me win here, it's pretty special,"" he said.

'Inspired a generation'

Woods' fifth Green Jacket and 15th major title has given the game of golf a serious jolt of electricity. Many of the game's top stars grew up inspired by Woods. Rory McIlroy even wrote him a letter as a golf-obsessed nine-year-old.

The young guns never got to witness Woods in his early 2000s pomp. Then, he trounced fields, intimidated rivals with his sheer presence and prowess and pulled off feats most deemed superhuman. Some of the game's younger stars have opined they would have loved to have competed against Woods in full flow. ""The hell they would,"" said former world No.1 David Duval, who tasted defeat at the hands of Woods too often.

Now they have, and golf's richer for it.

American pro Brandt Snedeker, a nine-time winner on the PGA Tour, summed up Woods' effect on the game.

""I don't know what else to say other than thank you Tiger Woods,"" he tweeted. ""You inspired my generation...You had a bunch of dads reliving their youths with their kids. You inspired another...The Masters brings out the best in golf and the best in the greats of the game.""

Three-time major champion Brooks Koepka, 28, who finished tied second Sunday, added: ""The atmosphere around Tiger is mind blowing and to be inside the ropes and just kind of see it as another player is pretty cool and unique. ""

Woods had his own inspiration in Jack Nicklaus, and it's been his life's goal to beat his fellow American's mark of 18 major titles. During the dark days, and the sad images of a washed-up, fading star, many scoffed at the notion of Woods ever winning another event, let alone a major.

He even confided to Nicklaus at the pre-Masters Champions Dinner a couple of years ago he was ""done.""

But the competitor in Woods wouldn't -- couldn't -- let it go.

""You never give up. You always fight. Just giving up's never in the equation,"" he said.

""We wake up every morning, and there's always challenges in front of us, and [we have to] keep fighting and keep getting through.""

And how he fought.

""Very few people really know what Tiger Woods has been through to get back to this point,"" McIlroy, who has become close to Woods in recent years, tweeted Sunday

'Shaking in my boots'

Now he's just three behind Nicklaus and with his ship pointed squarely at the next major. May's US PGA just happens to be at the infamous Bethpage Black on Long Island, New York, scene of Woods' 2002 US Open triumph. He won the Masters that year, too. And in June, the US Open returns to Pebble Beach in California, where Woods won his first US Open by an astonishing 15 shots, sparking a remarkable run where he held all four majors at the same time.

Nicklaus' record is on the line.

""I felt for a long time he was going to win again. He's got me shaking in my boots, guys,"" said the 79-year-old Sunday.

JUST WATCHED Tiger Woods speaks to CNN after 1997 Masters win Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tiger Woods speaks to CNN after 1997 Masters win 01:20

Nicklaus won his final major at the age of 46 at the 1986 Masters after a gap of six years, so Woods has time on his side. The oldest major winner in the modern era, 1968 US PGA champion Julius Boros, was 48. There's 19 majors until Woods turns 48.

Woods' long-time rival Phil Mickelson is still contending -- he was tied 18th at Augusta -- and he turns 49 in June.

""I think 18 [majors] is a lot closer than people think,"" added Koepka, who held off the charging Woods to win the US PGA last August.

While majors are the generalist barometer to measure success in golf, another goal driving Woods is to beat Sam Snead's record of 82 PGA Tour wins. He's now just one away from tying his countryman.

Woods pointed to other sports stars still excelling despite advancing years such as 37-year-old tennis great Roger Federer and six-time Super bowl winner Tom Brady, 41.

""The understanding of the general science of sports performance has allowed athletes to push their primes into much later stages,"" said Woods.

""As we get older, it sucks hopping in those ice baths, but it's just part of the deal.""

JUST WATCHED The Masters and the coveted 'green jacket' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The Masters and the coveted 'green jacket' 01:20

This new era of Woods' career also seems to have brought about a new era in the man.

Where once he was the supreme being, his failings have taught him humility. The teachings of his late father and mentor Earl, once lost in a fog of waywardness, have resurfaced. Woods has long given back to the game and to society through his Tiger Woods Foundation , but he is widely reported to be more open, more engaging with his fans, more willing to show a different side to the cold-hearted competitor. Up to a point, anyway.

""He wanted to be different. He was aloof,"" said Europe's Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington, a three-time major champion, talking to BBC Sport.

""Since he's come back to the sport he hangs out more, he wants to enjoy the life.""

Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos The Masters, Augusta – The opening major of the golf season is the Masters from Augusta, Georgia every April. It's a spring rite, steeped in tradition and layered in rich sporting history and drama. It's an event that attracts even non-golfers because of the sublime beauty of the course. Click through the gallery for an A-Z of the Masters. Hide Caption 1 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos A is for Augusta National – The revered course has hosted the year's opening major -- and the only one of the big four events to be played at the same course every year -- since 1934. A is also for the azaleas which traditionally blossom during Masters week and for Amen Corner, the infamous stretch of holes incorporating the 11th, the treacherous short 12th and the tee shot on the par-five 13th. Hide Caption 2 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos B is for Beauty – The Georgian greensward is an oasis among the urban landscape of Augusta, Georgia's second city on the banks of the Savannah River. The bars, burger joints and shopping malls of neighboring Washington Road are in stark contrast to the golfing dreamscape over the fence. B is also for Seve Ballesteros, the Spaniard who opened the European floodgates with wins in 1980 and 1983. Hide Caption 3 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos C is for Caddies – Augusta's caddies are instantly recognizable by their white jump suits. Before 1983, players had to use a club caddie, all of whom were local black men. Since then players have used their usual tour caddies, but they must still don the white suit and green cap. Hide Caption 4 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos D is for Dos and Don'ts – The hallowed property is governed by its own strict rules such as no running or cell phones, but on the flip side traditions exist such as the practice of placing your green Masters chair at your preferred spot and being able to return to your vacant seat hours later. Hide Caption 5 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos E is for Eisenhower – Former US President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a member of Augusta National and several landmarks of his era remain, including Ike's Pond, the fishing lake he championed that is the focal point of the Par-3 Contest. Eisenhower's white cabin also sits near the clubhouse. Hide Caption 6 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos F is for Fans (make that Patrons) – Visitors to Augusta National are known as patrons -- not fans or spectators or the crowd. Tickets are like gold dust, but a limited number of practice round tickets and tournament days are available through a yearly ballot. The waiting list for weekly tournament badges closed years ago. Hide Caption 7 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos G is for Grand Slam – Rory McIlroy just needs the Masters to complete the Grand Slam of all four of golf's major titles. The Northern Irishman blew a four-shot lead at Augusta in 2011, but having won four majors in the meantime returns for his fifth shot at the Grand Slam this week. Only five others have achieved the feat -- Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. G is also for greens -- the slick, sloping putting surfaces are infamous. Hide Caption 8 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos H is for History – Augusta National was created by Scottish golf course architect Dr. Alister Mackenzie and co-founder Bobby Jones and opened in 1933 on land that was once the site of Fruitlands Nursery. During World War II the land was briefly given over to turkey and cattle farming. Hide Caption 9 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos I is for Internationals – South African Gary Player -- pictured here in 2014 with Jack Nicklaus (left) and the late Arnold Palmer -- was the first international champion in 1961.

Hide Caption 10 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos J is for Jacket, as in green – The tropical-weight emerald blazer is worn by only Augusta National members and Masters champions. It was first introduced for members in 1937 and ordered from Brooks Uniform Company in New York. Sam Snead was the first winner to receive a jacket and honorary membership in 1949. The reigning Masters champion can take it home for a year, then it must be kept at the club. Hide Caption 11 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos K is for Key holes – The saying goes the Masters doesn't begin until the back nine on Sunday. It starts with one of the hardest holes on the course in the 10th and then enters Amen Corner with the equally tough 11th and then the booby trap of the short 12th. But the long 15th (pictured) is key -- big moves can be made with eagles here. Anything less than a birdie and you will likely go backwards. Hide Caption 12 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos L is for Lane, as in Magnolia Lane – The exclusive driveway to Augusta's historic clubhouse is framed by dozens of magnolia trees. Only members and Masters competitors are allowed to access this revered entrance which gives on to the Founder's Circle and then the whitewashed concrete clubhouse, built in 1854. Hide Caption 13 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos M is for Mickelson – Popular left-hander Phil Mickelson is one of 17 players to have won multiple Masters titles. The three-time champion won the first of his five major titles at Augusta in 2004 after three straight third places. Even at 48, Mickelson remains a Masters threat. Hide Caption 14 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos N is for Nicklaus, as in Jack – The most successful player at the Masters is Jack Nicklaus, whose six Green Jackets remains the record. The 79-year-old is now an honorary starter along with Gary Player, following the death of four-time champion Arnold Palmer in 2016. Hide Caption 15 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos O is for Oak tree – The famous old oak tree on the course side of the clubhouse is an iconic landmark and the traditional meeting place for the game's movers and shakers and media types with the correct credential. A familiar refrain of Masters week is: ""Meet you under the tree."" Hide Caption 16 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos P is for Par 3s, notably the 12th – Perhaps the most famous short hole in golf, the par-3 12th sits at the heart of Amen Corner. Like a wolf in sheep's clothing, it is just 155 yards long, but Rae's Creek looms large in front and a devilish wind always swirling around the trees makes club selection tricky. Hide Caption 17 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos Q is for Quonset Hut – Modern media are housed in a recently built state-of-the-art facility at the far end of the practice range, but in days gone by the stories from Augusta were crafted in a corrugated metal Quonset Hut. Hide Caption 18 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos R is for Roars – When the excitement rises on a Sunday afternoon and the patrons reach fever pitch, the roars reverberate around the towering pines which act like a giant organ reflecting the noise all over the course. A Phil Mickelson roar stands out, but a roar for Tiger Woods is like no other. Hide Caption 19 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos S is for Spieth – Jordan Spieth was on a fast track to being crowned the new king of Augusta following his wire-to-wire victory in 2015 and dominance for three rounds in 2016. He was still clear with nine holes to play before famously self destructing with two balls in the water on 12. The American has struggled of late and is down to 33rd in the world, but in five Masters appearances he has won, finished second twice, come third and 11th. Hide Caption 20 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos T is for Tradition – The Masters is forward looking but rooted in tradition, such as the pre-tournament Par-3 Contest, in which friends and family members caddie for the players and hit the occasional shot.

Other traditions include the Champions Dinner, in which the holder chooses the menu and hosts the evening on the Tuesday of Masters week Hide Caption 21 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos U is for Under par – When Jordan Spieth won in 2015 he equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record for the lowest winning score at 18 under par.

He went on to win three further Green Jackets, the last of which came in 2005 after a famous chip-in on the 16th. The 43-year-old is fit again after multiple back surgeries, and among the widely tipped contenders. Hide Caption 24 of 27 Photos: The Masters: A-Z in photos X is for X-factor – Winning the Masters requires a game in mint condition and a bit of something special. Think Tiger Woods' chip-in on the 16th in 2005, or Phil Mickelson's shot threaded through trees on the 13th in 2010. Or what about Bubba Watson's banana ball from the woods on the 10th to clinch a play off in 2012 (pictured)?

Emotional win

His burgeoning friendship with Mickelson, a long-time adversary, is clear evidence -- the bonding coming through shared life struggles and time spent on Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup teams as both careers ""should"" have been winding down. Cynics might say the recent $9M made-for-TV match with Mickelson was a vulgar money-making operation -- it's true both were thinking with their post-playing business heads on -- but the practice rounds at various events, and the back-and-forth showed genuine affection.

""What a great moment for the game of golf. I'm so impressed by Tiger Woods' incredible performance and I'm so happy for him to capture another Green Jacket, Truly a special day that will go down in history. Congratulations, Tiger! #Rematch,"" Mickelson tweeted

Tiger Woods' father Earl was his guiding light before his death in 2006.

The only time Woods has previously showed emotion after a win was when he sobbed on the shoulder of his then caddie Steve Williams after clinching the British Open at Hoylake in 2006, two months after Earl passed away.

At Augusta Sunday, Woods beamed, hugged his family, high-fived anyone within touching distance and whooped and hollered along with everyone else. Tears welled at times.

""I've never seen him show emotion like that. At any time, anywhere, any time in his life,"" another former coach Butch Harmon told Sky Sports.

""He was humbled by his own mistakes, the things he went through he created, nobody else created them, and he came out the other side.

""He got himself help, he got his body right, he got his head right and he went to work on his game. I couldn't be happier for him and his family.""

For plenty of golf's major champions over the years reaching the summit once has been their life's work, but for Woods, just proving to everyone he could win another major is not enough.

As long as he is healthy -- and the back appears to be holding up well with careful management of his schedule -- Woods will feel he is entering another period of pomp, albeit with less hair than the first.

It's been oft said of Woods that there is another twist in the tale somewhere. This tiger's tail is wagging furiously.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/9bTlOCpletA/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE
['Rob Hodgetts'],"He loved to draw as a child, and took up sketching again to escape the harsh realities of prison after being handed 39 years to life for the fatal shooting of a man in downtown Buffalo in 1991.

Art became Dixon's salvation, and he drew for up to 10 hours a day, wearing his colored pencils to the nib.

His reputation as an artist led the warden at the tough Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York to ask him to draw Augusta National's famous 12th hole from a picture in Golf Digest

Dixon was no golfer, and was reluctant at first, but the images of vivid green grass, clear blue skies, water, flowers and trees fired his imagination.

'Not my reality'

Fast forward to April 2019, and Dixon -- exonerated in September 2018 after 27 years in prison -- was invited to the Masters at Augusta to sketch for Golf Digest and to walk in the pictures previously only in his mind.

""I don't have no words to describe how beautiful it is,"" Dixon told CNN Sport. ""It was 10 times better than I expected.

""It was emotional. At one point I wanted to slap myself because I didn't think I was really standing there. I thought it was a dream or something like that. Not in a million years would I have thought this would be my reality.

""For a kid from the inner city, a very tough environment, it just means everything in the world.""

Valentino Dixon met Brooks Koepka (left) and Tiger Woods (right).

Beating the odds

At a dinner on the eve of the tournament Dixon met with Tiger Woods, who went on to clinch a remarkable 15th major title

""He was asking me about my drawing, asking me to talk him through how I put together a piece. He said he was going to try his best at the tournament. I said, 'No man, you're going to win this tournament.'"" Four days later Woods clinched his fifth Green Jacket, 14 years after his last following a tale of scandal, loss of form, injury and arrest.

Dixon's love of drawing golf scenes had given him only a passing interest in the game, but he was glued to Woods.

""The fact is that where I come from it's a struggle to make it, to be something in life,"" said Dixon. ""There's a lot of obstacles in the way. I think black people identify with Tiger as one of us, being a struggler in a world that at times can be extremely prejudicial towards you.

""We look at Tiger as a person that beat the odds. Like Rocky, who didn't have the skill to beat Apollo Creed but for some reason pulled it off through pure determination, pure willpower. Tiger had his fall with his personal problems. I became his biggest fan. I wanted to see him prove to the world he could do it again.

""These are the things that kept me strong all those years in the penitentiary, seeing stories like Rocky and identifying with the underdog and the person who wasn't supposed to make it. I walked out of prison at 49 but I was determined to hang in there and make something of myself. That was why I walked out of there with thousands of drawings because I pushed myself every day.""

'Eats at your soul'

Dixon was 21 when he was arrested for the shooting of Torriano Jackson during a disturbance outside a bar in Buffalo on the night of August 10, 1991. He admits he was at the scene, and acknowledges his record wasn't exactly squeaky clean, but he always maintained his innocence

""It's the worse feeling in the world. It eats at your soul and it kills you slowly,"" he said of being wrongfully imprisoned.

For the first seven years in prison he struggled badly.

In honor of the conclusion of #themasters . Here is one of my favorite Augusta drawings I did while in prison circa 2013. Finally got to see Amen Corner in person. 🙏 I can't thank everyone enough for making this possible. #golfdigest @maxadler @jimmyrobertsnbc pic.twitter.com/dP7xOscoQU — Valentino Dixon (@ValentinoDixon) April 15, 2019

""I was in such a depressed state,"" he said. ""I didn't have the spirit to draw. I didn't do anything but hang out and waste away.""

His uncle encouraged him to pick up the drawing again and sent him some art supplies. ""I started doodling a little bit and I haven't stopped since,"" he added.

Golf was not a subject he chose deliberately. But when the warden knocked on his cell door clutching a picture of his favourite hole at Augusta, it changed his life.

""I didn't really want to draw it, to be honest with you, because I didn't know if the other inmates would turn on me,"" he said.

""The warden was a good guy, but where I come from the inmates don't golf. Maybe one out of every 100 golfs. So I took a chance and said, 'Alright, bring it in, I'll draw it.'

""The inmates pay attention to everything, but they fell in love with the 12th hole too. Another inmate said I should do some more golf courses. He planted a seed and a couple of weeks later I started drawing every day. The rest is history.""

Dixon developed his style over two decades, drawing up to 10 hours a day in prison.

Nelson Mandela

In 2012, he sent some of his art work to Golf Digest's editorial director Max Adler for his ""Golf Saved My Life"" column. Along with the pictures, he included details of his case. Adler was intrigued and dug deeper. Golf Channel got involved, too. Meanwhile, several appeals against his conviction had failed. But then in January 2018 three undergraduate students and their professors from Georgetown University thoroughly researched Dixon's case as part of their studies.

Valentino presented me drawings of Augusta's 12th & 13th that he had done in prison, and shared his story & heart. How did Valentino meet Max? It was a letter to Max from Valentino—inmate #91-B-1615—in 2011, as a submission to a monthly piece called ""How Golf Saved My Life."" 🙏 pic.twitter.com/WpYfR0deQz — Jack Nicklaus (@jacknicklaus) April 14, 2019

The students re-interviewed witnesses and officials and unearthed new evidence. Another man, LaMarr Scott -- already serving a life sentence for his part in an armed robbery in 1993 -- confessed again to shooting Jackson, just as he had on the night it happened.

""The guy that committed the crime turned himself in,"" said Dixon. ""He felt bad about me being arrested. They told him they didn't believe him and told him to leave the police station. Then eight witnesses told them I didn't commit the crime.""

Through the work of Adler, the students, his daughter Valentina (who was four months old when he was arrested) and attorney Donald Thompson, paid for by Dixon's wife Louise -- whom he married while in prison -- the fresh evidence was presented to the new district attorney of Erie County, John Flynn.

Dixon was exonerated on September 19, 2018.

At Augusta, Dixon showcased his work and handed Nicklaus a signed drawing of the 13th hole he had done while in prison.

Nicklaus, whose record of 18 major titles Woods is chasing, said meeting Dixon was ""one of the most memorable moments"" of the Masters. Nicklaus said Dixon's attitude reminded him of Nelson Mandela.

""I spent a fair amount of time with Mandela,"" Nicklaus told Dixon . ""He came out, he didn't have any malice, he loved his fellow man, he was such a great leader for South Africa. I have great respect for Nelson Mandela, as I have for you.""

Dixon presented Jack Nicklaus with one of his drawings at the Masters. Max Adler center.

'Count your blessings'

Dixon says he ""never felt any malice or hate towards anybody"" because of his situation. ""I was upset but I'm just not that type of person. Over the years I tried to change the way I felt and be angry and bitter but that's not who I am. God wouldn't ever allow me to change the way I am as a person. I kept my spirit strong, just kept being a loving person and just dealt with the situation.

""I look at other people suffering in the world and thought there's people doing worse than me and I'm in a prison cell. You have to count your blessings. I was healthy, I had my sanity -- I had friends that lost their minds or committed suicide in prison -- I had family support.""

Despite his new-found celebrity in the world of golf, Dixon has still only played the game twice.

""I'm no good at it but I enjoy it,"" he said. ""I'll stick with the drawing and let the golfers golf.""

He is still rekindling relationships and helping out family members after so long incarcerated and plans to release a line of greetings cards alongside his work as an artist.

Dixon longs to be reunited with his Australian wife -- they talk every day on the phone -- but she was deported for overstaying her visa and isn't allowed into the US. Dixon can't leave.

Given his experiences, he is also fighting for prison reform and a reduction of prison sentencing, which he claims is ""ridiculous and excessive"" and a ""violation of human rights.""

Mainly, though he wants to improve himself, as a man and an artist, if not necessarily a golfer.

""I'm just going to be the best I can be and push myself to the limit. As far as I can go,"" he said.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/AJipoa3fN-0/index.html,CNN,Sports,TRUE

Yet that film is only one example of a recurring theme in movies associated with such an outbreak, a longtime staple of science fiction that has always been informed by science fact.

['Review Brian Lowry'],"(CNN) Vin Diesel doesn't drive that fast, but he's plenty furious in ""Bloodshot,"" and with good reason. Adapted from a comic book, the movie casts the heavily muscled star as a zombie killing machine, in what amounts to a superhero origin story with more twists than expected, but ultimately a simple-minded excuse for lots and lots of action.

Diesel plays Ray Garrison, a soldier introduced on a perilous mission before getting kidnapped and killed -- and that's all before the opening titles.

Ray's resurrection comes courtesy of RST corporation, just your average shadowy research facility that turns wounded warriors into super-soldiers with Robocop-like enhancements.

Ray, however, is its masterpiece, with the company having borrowed bodies from the military before perfecting nanotechnology that not only brought him back but turns him into a a near-unstoppable force, capable of almost instantly regenerating when damaged. Think Wolverine, minus the claws.

He's described as a multi-billion-dollar prototype (take that, ""Six Million Dollar Man""), under the stewardship of tech visionary Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce, kind of slumming it). Ray is also united with a team of upgraded soldiers, among them KT (Eiza Gonzalez), who seems especially sensitive to Ray's plight, which includes lost memories.

['Review Brian Lowry'],"(CNN) Pete Davidson doesn't exactly stretch much as a performer playing a 20-something slacker in ""Big Time Adolescence,"" a Hulu-bound movie that's most surprising for what it isn't. Somewhat ironically, the main flaw with this earnest film built around a directionless character is its lack of a clear objective.

Buying into the premise requires a bit of leeway to get started: During high school, Davidson's Zeke dated the older sister of Mo (Griffin Gluck), and remained his pal after they broke up. Now Mo's a 16-year-old high school student -- with all the attendant insecurities -- and Zeke, at 23, mostly enjoys getting high and playing video games.

That the two remain near-inseparable seems odd to, well, pretty much everyone, perhaps especially Mo's dad (Jon Cryer). Yet the family tolerates the situation, which will gradually have pretty significant consequences (foreshadowed in a pre-credit sequence) as Mo's budding adolescence runs into Zeke's Peter Pan-like case of arrested development.

For Davidson, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star whose off-screen life is generally more interesting than his on-screen contributions, Zeke certainly offers an easy transition to movies, though the central focus is actually Gluck, whose struggles with all the usual teen troubles are complicated by Zeke's been-there advice and generally bad influence.

Mo insists Zeke is ""a nice guy once you get to know him,"" but his cavalier attitude -- toward everything from his retail job to relationships -- doesn't always make him the most sterling counselor. That includes his suggestion that Mo become the source of booze and pot for a circle of ""friends"" that not surprisingly mushrooms after learning that he can supply them.

['Sandra Gonzalez'],"(CNN) This weekend, I cleaned the floors of my home with a diluted bleach solution and developed a protocol for entering my home from the outside world that was inspired by decontamination chambers I've seen in TV shows.

To be clear, you don't have to put these procedures into place due to the coronavirus pandemic. The best defense is actually washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds and not touching your face.

But I am, to be frank, a bit of a germaphobe, who instituted a similarly strict approach to cleanliness after our home got hit particularly hard from the flu this year. (Clearly, we run a party home; over for brunch, sometime!)

I've discovered over time -- and through some serious therapy, in case you're wonder -- that I am someone that prefers to stare my anxieties right in the face. (Note: If you prefer to do the opposite, I made a list for you, too.)

When I was stressed over planning my wedding, I watched hours of wedding-related television , including every episode of ""Four Weddings."" When a bunch of people I knew confronted serious medical issues just weeks apart, I binge watched ""ER.""

As fears over coronavirus have affected daily life, a stare-off with my paranoia has begun. These are some of the shows I've been watching:

""Containment""

'Containment'

This CW limited series about a mysterious outbreak checked all the boxes of both a good pandemic story (graphic depictions of illness) and the things you'd come to the CW for (romances tested by extreme circumstances). The show managed a mildly satisfying conclusion despite the network deciding the story was best, um, contained to one season.

Why watch it? It's a good option if you're tired of watching "" It's a good option if you're tired of watching "" Contagion .""

""Kitchen Nightmares""

Gordon Ramsey hosts 'Kitchen Nightmares'

This show doesn't directly have to do with an outbreak, but let me tell you, dirty commercial kitchens are a pandemic in need of eradicating. Luckily, chef Gordon Ramsey is on the case. If you're trying to inspire yourself to do a good cleaning of your kitchen, there is no better inspiration out there than looking at the horrors contained inside poorly maintained walk-in freezers.

Why watch it? You might be inspired to eat in, limiting your exposure to a number of ailments.

""The Hot Zone""

Dr. Nancy Jaax (Julianna Margulies) works in her pathology lab in an episode of ""The Hot Zone."" (National Geographic/Amanda Matlovich)

Julianna Margulies starred in this 6-episode limited series for National Geographic based on the book of the same name. In the series, an Army scientist (Marguilies) works to contain an Ebola outbreak in the nation's capital. The opening moments, like the book, are graphic and horrifying as a sick airplane passenger sets the scene. It's truly the stuff of nightmares, if you're into that sort of thing.

Why watch it? It's educational. But be warned: you may develop a fear of monkeys.

It's available On Demand.

""Doomsday Preppers""

'Doomsday'

Even those of us who have a well-stocked earthquake kit -- or similar emergency supplies, depending on the threats in the area you live — will feel ill prepared watching the people featured on this National Geographic series. Over four seasons, viewers were introduced to people preparing for all sorts of disasters, from earthquakes and economic collapse to, yes, pandemics

Why watch it? You may walk away with a desire to up your prep game.

""Hoarders""

'Hoarders'

Look, there's being prepared and then there's going too far. Yes, I'm looking at you, woman in line at Ralph's with four 12 packs of toilet paper.

Why watch it? This show might inspire you to take much-needed chill pill if you've in the last week cleaned out the cleaning aisle of your local Target.

Not a TV show: ""As Good As It Gets""

RuPaul hosts the competition, now in its 12th season, alongside his 'best squirrel friend' Michelle Visage and a slew of celebrity guest judges. The show will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and if you find yourself questioning society's standards of gender expression in the process, then that's the bow on this 3-foot-tall wig.""

['Review Brian Lowry'],"(CNN) ""The Banker"" is a sturdy, old-fashioned film that's been put under the microscope for two unrelated reasons: Not only does it represent Apple's first bite at movies, but allegations involving the subject's children prompted a delay in its release. Setting that aside, the story chronicles a fascinating moment in the civil rights movement, without yielding quite the returns that it should.

Based on real events (although its accuracy is among the aspects that have been challenged), the film centers on Bernard Garrett (Anthony Mackie), a self-taught real-estate whiz who set his sights on Los Angeles in the 1950s. He's introduced exhibiting his savvy for business as a child in small-town Texas, where his father says of those entrepreneurial aspirations, ""You were born the wrong color, son.""

A grown-up Garrett is still the wrong color for L.A. in that era but finds creative ways to skirt the roadblocks. First, he aligns himself with a well-established white developer (Colm Meaney) and subsequently a colorful club owner, Joe Morris (Samuel L. Jackson), a boisterous fellow who thinks his tightly-wound partner desperately needs to lighten up.

The film doesn't really kick into gear, though, until Garrett and Morris hatch a scheme to secretly expand their footprint in acquiring white-owned properties by tapping a young white guy, Matt Steiner (Nicholas Hoult), to serve as the face of their operation.

The arrangement brings to mind the movie ""The Front,"" in which Woody Allen's character pretended to pen scripts from blacklisted writers. Director George Nolfi and several credited writers have the most fun with a sequence in which the African-American businessmen school their protégé in the ways of hobnobbing with white power brokers, using golf as a point of entry.

['Review Brian Lowry'],"(CNN) ""Hunters"" is such an enticing premise as to overcome its execution problems, at least for a while. But the tone of this Amazon series -- which counts Al Pacino among its ensemble cast -- varies wildly, leaving behind a show that isn't bad, but which really should be a whole lot better.

Inspired by true events but clearly heavily dramatized, the series focuses on a ragtag band of Nazi hunters operating in New York in the 1970s. The threat, moreover, is more than just a few guards that escaped, but rather an orchestrated network seeking to establish a Fourth Reich on U.S. soil.

The premiere, a 90-minute effort that too slowly introduces those stakes, fares best in establishing the time and place. It opens with the unwitting hero, Jonah (Logan Lerman), leaving a screening of ""Star Wars"" with his buddies. It's the first of many Quentin Tarantino-like references to the era -- among them Son of Sam and a later ""Saturday Night Fever"" dance routine -- which only that send-ups of nostalgic pop culture should largely be left to the experts, since it can be heavy-handed here.

Jonah is a comic-book fan, so being thrust into a world of hidden Nazis is a bit like those fantasies come to life, only in deadly fashion that painfully hits home. His guide is Meyer Offerman (Pacino), a wealthy concentration-camp survivor who Meyer likens to X-Men patriarch Professor X and refers to as ""Bruce Wayne rich,"" and who uses those resources to fund the Nazi-fighting efforts.

Meyer's group includes a number of fine veteran actors, among them Josh Radnor, Saul Rubinek and Carol Kane, with Dylan Baker and Lena Olin on the opposite side of the fight. Simultaneously, an FBI agent (Jerrika Hinton) begins nosing around a suspicious murder, putting her on the trail of a scheme that's almost too fantastic to believe, one that's financially powerful and politically connected.

['Review Brian Lowry'],"(CNN) Pixar's enviable track record with original animation is a mixed blessing, creating sky-high expectations for each new movie. ""Onward,"" an undeniably emotional and imaginative concept, joins that rich tradition, without reaching the upper rungs of the ladder set by its predecessors.

Fundamentally about a pair of brothers dealing with lingering grief over the loss of their dad, the film adds a magical wrinkle to the premise by setting the story in a mythical world filled with elves, centaurs and pixies -- one where modern wonders and mechanization evolved very much along the lines of our own.

Still, hints remain of the magic that once ran rampant, we're told at the outset. And it's a belief in those fantastic possibilities that lead an elf Ian, just turned 16, and his goofball older brother Barley on a quest to bring their dad back, if only for a day.

That's right, the ""visitation spell"" that the pair invoke only lasts for 24 hours -- enough time, they reckon, to bid him a proper farewell. But something goes wrong (or there wouldn't be enough material for a movie), leaving dad reconstituted only from the waist down, as the two embark on a desperate mission to find the magical object that will allow them to complete the spell in time.

In a Marvel-ous pairing, Ian and Barley are voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, respectively, and they bring a goofy chemistry to their interaction, with the level-headed younger brother forced to ground the free-spirited older one.

['Karla Cripps'],"Chiang Rai, Thailand (CNN) — Elephants don't sleep much. They eat loudly. They pass gas loudly, too.

The two transparent domes sit next to a large enclosure inhabited by three rescued elephants, which are cared for by the resort's Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation

Related content 20 stunning new Asia Pacific luxury hotels to check into in 2020

Guests can sit back and watch as these female elephants play with the strategically placed ""toys"" that hang from large trees, their powerful trunks occasionally ripping off huge chunks of bark and branches, sending loud cracks through the evening air.

But really, they mainly just want to eat.

Thankfully, a hefty supply of sugar cane is placed within eyesight of the bubbles, meaning the elephants are almost always just a few steps away.

Once-in-a-lifetime experience

l e v a r t

The bubbles are booked as an ""experience"" in addition to your reserved resort room, for 17,700 baht (US$563) per night per couple. This means you can just pack an overnight bag and leave the rest of your belongings in your suite.

Guests are picked up from the lobby just before sunset, then driven down a dirt road in an open-air jeep before taking a short walk through the resort's rice paddy to get to the bubbles.

Shortly after arrival, staff deliver an evening picnic basket, filled with pre-selected sandwiches and other cold dishes, allowing you to eat alongside the animals. There's a strict ""no hands"" policy when it comes to the elephants though -- bubble guests are not allowed to touch or feed them.

So how comfortable are the bubbles?

Each air-conditioned, pressurized 22-square-meter space is a mini slice of luxury, furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. There's a small washroom with a toilet and shower, along with a couple of chairs and a small table near the bed. No TVs here -- the elephants are the star of this show.

Sensitive sleepers will find It particularly surreal. As night passed during a recent visit, the moon made its way over the bubble, offering various levels of illumination. (Eye masks are provided as it can be surprisingly bright.)

Given these ladies don't nod off much -- elephants in captivity sleep only 4-6 hours a day -- you'll hear all sorts of delightful sounds throughout the night and might find yourself crawling out of bed for a late-night peek.

The bed features wrap-around curtains, offering privacy for those who worry they won't wake up before the caretakers arrive with the elephants' breakfast.

Trial and error

The idea for the ""Jungle Bubbles"" came from General Manager Gaudéric Harang, who has been with the resort for about a year and a half. He says they were born of a desire to push the boundaries and offer a unique guest experience in line with modern luxury expectations.

In addition to safety concerns -- ""making sure our bubbles would be elephant proof"" -- he says they had to meet very high standards.

""As a top notch resort, we had to ensure the experience would be very luxurious and to the level of what is expected by our guests,"" he explains.

Once the bubbles were set up, Harang was the first to trial them.

""Being in the north of Thailand, we are lucky to have a climate that's more varied than in the rest of the country,"" he says. ""Though short, we go through a winter season that is very cold. When the bubbles were finally ready [in December] it was 6 degrees Celsius in the morning and...well I froze!

""There was no heater. Also, being located in the jungle there is a lot of humidity so the bubbles were very wet at night due to all the condensation. So, I woke up at 3 a.m., soaked and cold.""

As a result, the bubbles are now equipped with an air conditioner, space heater and dehumidifier to ensure a comfortable climate for all seasons.

""When I finally saw the bubbles in place I was so happy it all worked out, but I think I was only really impressed when I slept in it the second time [after the climate issues were sorted],"" he recalls, telling CNN Travel it was truly a ""wow"" moment.

""When you finally live it, you see it's really a fantastic experience. We couldn't have planned it better.""

The right elephants for the job

Picking the right elephants for the Jungle Bubbles experience was another logistical issue that needed to be sorted, says John Roberts, Anantara's Director of Elephants.

Besides size considerations -- how many elephants could comfortably live on the available plot of land? -- they also had to decide which of the camp's elephants would enjoy being together in the enclosure. Turns out, even elephants can get into tiffs with their friends -- just like humans but with an additional 3.5 tonnes of weight to throw around.

The three elephants in the Jungle Bubbles enclosure all arrived at the resort between 2006-2010, so Roberts and his team already had ample time to get familiar with their temperaments.

""We watched them for a long time,"" says Roberts. ""We know that they like being together -- actually [two of them] are pretty much inseparable at this stage and if you try and separate them they get pretty stressed.""

Offering a better life to captive elephants

The resort, located in Chiang Saen, overlooks Myanmar and Laos. Etienne de Villiers

Anantara's nonprofit Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation (GTAEF), founded in 2006 and overseen by Roberts, cares for about two dozen elephants.

Most of the animals have led hard lives -- some spent their days walking the streets of Bangkok with their owners, making money begging from tourists. Others came from tourist trekking camps.

The way the program works is the foundation invites mahouts (elephant trainers/owners) and their families to move to Chiang Rai with their elephants and live in the foundation's camp.

The foundation offers them a wage, which includes the cost of care for their elephants. This amounts to about $18,000 per elephant per year.

Roberts acknowledges that in a perfect world all elephants would be roaming free in the wild but the situation is incredibly complex.

""Unfortunately, you can't release elephants in Thailand,"" he says, rattling off a long list of complications including fears of disease transmission, potential conflict in a fragile wild herd and an inability for domesticated elephants to fend for themselves given they've spent most if not all of their lives in captivity. And then there are Thailand's laws, which would also need to be changed.

Thailand's domesticated elephants are all registered under the Draft Animals Act, so ""if you put a captive elephant in a national park you're officially illegally grazing your livestock and that's the law as it is,"" says Roberts.

As an alternative, the GTAEF aims to improve the welfare of captive elephants through various programs not just at its resort but throughout the region -- including mahout training -- while also taking part in conservation and wild elephant programs.

At the resort's elephant camp, this means figuring out the elephants' personalities though science and observation and matching them with activities that suit them -- an essential part of their well-being. For instance, elephants that are comfortable around strangers take part in the peaceful ""Walking with Giants"" experience.

""In the wild their entire lives are based around walking long distances and finding food,"" says Roberts. ""They have big brains, you have to keep them stimulated doing different things. You could just put them out there in a field, but they'll stand in one spot all day.""

The Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort is located on the edge of Thailand's northern border in the town of Chiang Saen, just over an hour from Chiang Rai city.

There are two restaurants -- Thai eatery Sala Mae Nam and Baan Dhalia, which serves Italian -- while the poolside Elephant Bar and Opium Terrace is an essential stop for pre-dinner drinks.

The spacious rooms, featuring traditional Thai decor, come with long balconies that overlook both Laos and Myanmar. Coffee in hand, it's the perfect place to begin the day, watching the sun rise through the mist.

Resort activities include day trips to Laos and Myanmar, river boat journeys, spa treatments and in-house classes like cooking and Muay Thai.

['Tamara Hardingham-Gill'],"(CNN) — While there's no doubt that having your vacation interrupted by a fast-spreading virus that's infected more than 108,000 globally and killed over 3,800 is a major inconvenience, there are surely worse places to be confined than a luxury Maldives resort.

Over the weekend, the Indian Ocean island nation was added to the ever-growing list of countries with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus after two staff members at the Kuredu Island Resort & Spa , located on the northern reef of Lhaviyani Atoll, tested positive for the virus

As a precaution, the entire resort has been placed under quarantine, with all guests and staff restricted from leaving until further notice.

""The temporary restrictive measures will continue until such time that the authorities release the island from its quarantine period,"" reads a statement on the website for Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, where accommodation options include private pool villas, beach bungalows and hot tub beach villas.

""At this time there will be no flight in or out of the island. The island is well stocked with the essentials and we are confident in the care that will be provided to all.""

The decision was made after two staff members tested positive for the virus shortly after coming into contact with an Italian tourist who had tested positive for the virus after returning home.

According to Ali Waheed, tourism minister for the Maldives, all of those who had contact with the two infected patients during their stay are now in ""self isolation"" and will be monitored for the next two weeks.

However, authorities have opted to lock down the entire resort as an extra provision, ensuring that all guests and employees ""remain on the island and follow advice and guidance of the Maldives Health Protection Agency and the Ministry of Tourism.""

Those who aren't under self isolation will hopefully have plenty to keep them busy as the resort, a 35-minute seaplane ride from capital Male, offers activities such as scuba diving, windsurfing and kiteboarding, as well as a highly rated spa -- although it's not clear whether these will still be on offer.

Since news broke of the confirmed cases at Kuredu Island Resort & Spa, there have been two cases at the Sandies Bathala Resort in A.A Atoll, which has also been placed under lock down, bringing the number of cases in the Maldives up to four.

Authorities have also banned any passengers ""originating from and transiting through Italy"" from entering the Maldives, as well as any travelers who have visited the European country within the last two weeks.

A separate Maldives resort, Summer Island, was also placed under ""temporary restrictive measures"" after two individuals developed coronavirus symptoms while holidaying there.

However, the restrictions were lifted once the tourists in question tested negative for coronavirus.

['Lilit Marcus'],"(CNN) — One of Easter Island 's world-famous moai statues has been destroyed in an accident.

A Chilean island resident was arrested on March 1 after his truck -- a private vehicle, not a commercial one -- crashed into one of the stone figures and badly damaged both it and the ahu, or platform, it was perched on.

Local authorities believe that the accident was caused by brake failure that caused his truck to slide downhill.

On the island, which is known as Hanga Roa by its native Rapa Nui people, the enormous stone heads called moai have long been a source of intrigue and wonder.

""The damage is incalculable,"" Camilo Rapu, president of Easter Island's indigenous Rapa Nui community, told CNN in a statement.

The island's mayor, Pedro Pablo Petero Edmunds Paoa, is calling for stricter regulations that will prohibit vehicles from driving near the 1,000-odd moai on the UNESCO World Heritage-listed island.

Edmunds Paoa tried to pass an anti-driving measure eight years ago, he told Chilean newspaper El Mercurio de Valparaíso , with no effect. He believes that this week's accident could be the motivating factor to consider re-introducing the proposal.

""The Moai are sacred structures of religious value for the Rapa Nui people,"" Rapu said. ""Furthermore, [the damage of the moai] is an offense to a culture that has lived many years struggling to recover its heritage and archaeology.""

Moai were carved from solid basalt between the 13th and 16th centuries. Tourism Chile

Easter Island, a Polynesian island that is a territory of Chile, has long struggled to balance its status as a bucket list travel destination with the local Rapa Nui people's desire to protect their heritage.

The moai statues represent ancestral figures and may have also been ways to show where fresh water sources were located

['Lilit Marcus'],"(CNN) — The tiny Pacific island of Niue may just be the best place on Earth for stargazing

Niue, a Polynesian island about halfway between Fiji and the Cook Islands, has earned recognition from the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), an organization that works to end light pollution and give people more opportunities to see the stars.

While several spots around the world have been heralded by the IDA -- including Grand Canyon National Park in the United States -- this is the first time that an entire country has been recognized.

""Being a dark sky nation will help protect Niue's night skies for future generations of Niueans and visitors to the country.""

The country's commitment to reducing light pollution was evident during the Dark Sky application process. One major move was when Niue committed to replacing all its streetlights with lower-emitting, more energy-efficient bulbs.

['Silvia Marchetti'],"(CNN) — His ship may have been to hell and back, becoming a floating coronavirus-infected prison for passengers quarantined at port in Japan, but when the captain of the Diamond Princess cruise ship became the last person aboard to finally step onto dry land, he looked entirely unruffled by the experience.

If it weren't for the mask on his face, Gennaro Arma, striding purposefully along the dockside in full uniform with hat under arm, might easily have been stepping down from an uneventful trip shuttling passengers from one vacation destination to another.

But those who know him best say the steadfast calm Arma exhibited throughout the ordeal in which more than 700 people on board the ship tested positive for COVID-19 was typical.

It's why, they say, the experienced Italian sailor is now being hailed as a hero at home and abroad.

""He emerged to be exactly how people have renamed him -- 'Fearless',"" Arma's wife, Mariana Gargiulo, tells CNN Travel from her home in Sant'Agnello, a beautiful coastal town south of Naples, where the captain is due to return soon.

""He never had any problems, and I never worried because we were constantly in contact.""

The quarantine aboard the Diamond Princess has been widely criticized for intensifying the risk of infection for those stuck aboard. Many passengers were eventually airlifted out, but not before at least five people had contracted fatal infections.

Nevertheless, Arma apparently proved himself a tireless rock for his passengers and crew during their ordeal and he's been widely praised for helping lift spirits and for setting a noble example of how a captain should deal with adversity.

'My gladiators'

His support for his crew was on display right to the end when he disembarked on March 2, having overseen the final transfer of all passengers either to hospital or a quarantine facility.

He called them ""my gladiators.""

Throughout the quarantine, he also regularly thanked all passengers on board for their patience and perseverance, leaving them notes of encouragement.

Back in Sant'Agnello his friends, family, townsfolk and local authorities are waiting for Arma's return, preparing to throw him a huge homecoming party. The captain tested negative for the virus and is currently in quarantine in Japan.

His wife says the captain's calm and control during the emergency made it easier for passengers to endure being confined to their cabins. It also gave his family a sense of peace and reassurance.

""We talked each day, both by phone and video chat,"" she says. ""I could hear he was calm, that everything was fine, and I could see that he was fine. He never had any problems.

""I could see him on the ship, he was doing well, working. We had the chance to talk a bit about everything, even our family, and not just about the situation on board.""

Arma, according to Gargiulo, is a real sea dog with decades of expertise that led him to travel around the world after he graduated at a prestigious local maritime school.

""He is a man with great sea skills and know-how,"" she adds. ""His main worry has always been the well-being of his passengers. It was a good test.""

As the wife of a cruise liner captain, Gargiulo has come to share and support her husband's job. She says she's ""always been very serene"" even during the past critical weeks.

""After many years, I'm used by now to the fact that he can be away, and far away, for a long period of time.""

Gargiulo says she doesn't know what Arma's next plans will be -- whether he'll take a break or not before heading back to sea. For now, she says she's just focused on seeing him again.

'A true diamond'

His employer, Princess Cruises, has already expressed its gratitude for its captain's efforts.

""Throughout the response efforts on Diamond Princess, Captain Arma was an exceptionally calm, capable, and inspirational leader for everyone on board,"" Princess Cruises president Jan Swartz said in a statement to CNN.

""From his regular daily shipboard updates to his tireless coordination with public health authorities, Princess shoreside operations, and his on-board team, Captain Arma's contributions have been hailed worldwide as a case study in outstanding leadership best practices.

""As he said to his self-proclaimed 'gladiators' onboard -- a diamond is a piece of coal that did really well under pressure, and I believe Captain Arma himself is a true diamond.""

Passengers too have praised Arma's steady leadership and the comfort he showed them through regular messages, updates and even gifts.

""Thank you to [Captain] Gennaro for his announcements and ability to find humor in an unusual circumstance,"" wrote one guest , Au Na Tan, on Twitter.

She added that Arma was ""courageous, sympathetic and carried himself with dignity and optimism for what was an unprecedented and unique situation. Through the entire journey, he sought to bring light to our circumstances and strove to reassure us as much as he could,"" because it's true that only ""a frightened captain makes a frightened crew .""

Arma's wife says his warm and friendly approach to guests is one of his many winning traits and part of his character.

'Symbol of Italy'

""He always takes good care of passengers, he's always had a particular attention for them,"" she says. ""Each day at lunchtime, before they'd start to eat, he wishes them all 'buon appetito' in Italian.

""And then there was the gesture of handing out flowers and chocolates on St. Valentine's Day to passengers shut in their cabins,"" to make them feel better and let them know they've not been abandoned, she says. ""It must have been really hard for them.""

Passengers were thankful for the Valentine gifts and food, posting photos online of what Arma's crew provided them with.

At one point, Arma recited a quote from the Bible to guests on the power of love, taken from one of St. Paul's letters to the Corinthians, to lift spirits and send out a message of faith and resilience.

It's not just those who endured the drama on board who have praised the captain.

His actions have resonated worldwide, especially in Italy where many people have seen him as embodying Italian endurance and the spirit of sacrifice. They've turned to social media to express gratitude and feelings in phrases such as "" proud to be Italian . Grazie!""

Another admirer says he should be ""a mandatory case history for talkative, braggart and cowardly politicians.""

""There are captains and captains,"" reads another post that says Arma's actions would be worthy of inclusion in writer Rudyard Kipling's novel ""Captains Courageous.""

'Anti-Schettino'

Now a symbol of Italian pride, Arma has been described as "" the anti-Schettino .""

He's the ""best weapon ('arma' in Italian) against all the Schettinos in the world,"" said one tweet

Local Sorrento and Amalfi coast newsrooms have also been flooded with messages from Arma's new fans.

One of them wrote how the captain's efforts make him worthy of ""the same sea waters roamed by Odysseus, Aeneas, Christopher Columbus"" and other great seafarers and mythological heroes.

Matching heroism with humility, Arma's final message to his crew stressed that it was teamwork that pulled them all through.

""We are all on the final leg of our journey,"" he wrote. ""Stay strong, look after yourselves. We will finish as we started: together.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/QwZYmjfEvH0/index.html,CNN,Travel,TRUE
"['Cynthia Drescher', ""Maureen O'Hare""]","(CNN) — In the little more than 100 years of commercial air travel , thousands of airlines have come and gone as casualties of oil prices, politics, mismanagement or financial loss.

Some closures are more memorable than others, such as Pan Am's fall from grace and the recent collapse of Thomas Cook, but each of these 17 airlines managed to make an impression on the industry, and on their passengers, before flying their final flights.

Flybe

UK airline Flybe went into administration March 4 , after a slump in bookings due to the novel coronavirus outbreak proved the nail in the coffin for the struggling carrier.

The low-budget airline celebrated its 40th anniversary last year and was Europe's largest independent regional airline, at one point operating more than 200 routes.

The UK government announced in January that it was in talks with the ailing carrier ""to set Flybe on a recovery path.""

However, the coronavirus outbreak in Europe meant the airline fell victim to a drop in demand for plane travel which has thrown the industry into crisis worldwide, with flights being canceled, planes grounded and airline staff across the globe forced to take unpaid leave.

Thomas Cook Group Airlines

British tour operator Thomas Cook, a venerable institution of 178 years' standing, collapsed in September 2019, stranding hundreds of thousands of travelers and triggering a huge repatriation effort.

Cook's increasingly old-fashioned model of selling package deals of flights on its own airlines, along with hotel rooms, from brick-and-mortar stores meant it had been struggling to compete with online rivals and low-budget upstarts.

Uncertainty over Brexit and a weak pound were also cited as contributor factors to the operator's struggles.

The airline section of the business operated with more than 100 aircraft, based in the UK, Denmark and Germany.

Wow Air

In March 2019, Iceland-based Wow Air, known for its wow-ingly low-priced flights between Europe and North America, abruptly shuttered and announced it was bankrupt.

""Wow had been in financial trouble, they had attempted to merge with Icelandair which failed,"" says CNN's Richard Quest. ""The writing was on the wall but Wow just continued to let people book.""

When the hoped-for merger with Icelandair fell apart at the last minute, it resulted in stranded passengers throughout Europe.

Although Wow's bright purple liveries and charismatic CEO Skuli Mogensen got plenty of buzz during its eight-year tenure, the airline might be best remembered for its spectacular demise.

US Airways

Founded in 1937 as ""All American Aviation,"" the airline rebranded to ""Allegheny Airlines"" in 1953, to ""USAir"" in 1979, when it was considered among the world's largest airlines, and finally to ""US Airways"" in 1997.

As US Airways, the carrier flew a wide domestic and international network from its hubs at Charlotte, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Washington D.C.-National airports, and bought up Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA), Piedmont Airlines, and the failing Trump Shuttle.

On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 landed on the Hudson River following engine failure from multiple bird strikes. All passengers and crew survived in the event, now termed the ""Miracle on the Hudson.""

US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2013, forming the world's largest airline, with the final US Airways-branded flight landed in April 2015.

The airline was responsible for many historic ""firsts,"" such as hiring the first African-American pilot to work for any major US carrier (1963), inaugurating the first regular jet routes connecting islands across the Pacific (1968), flying the first non-stop route over 16 hours (Newark to Hong Kong, 2001) and offering 24-hour online support (2009).

Headquartered in Houston and with other hubs in Cleveland, Newark and Guam, Continental flew until it merged with United Airlines in 2012.

Midwest Airlines

This airline, founded in 1984 and with routes across the country chiefly from its Milwaukee and Kansas City hubs, ceased to exist in late 2010 when it merged into Frontier Airlines.

From the 1990s into the early 2000s, Midwest set itself apart from competitors by continuing to offer generous, complimentary hot meals when other airlines were cutting back on amenities.

Midwest's famous warm chocolate chip cookies, baked and served onboard every flight, outlasted the Midwest brand and continued on Frontier flights until that airline discontinued the cookie service in 2012.

ATA Airlines

Initially launching as charter company in 1973, ATA began scheduled operations in 1986 with flights from the Midwest to Florida, serving vacation routes that would ultimately become the airline's specialty despite a brief experiment with international flights.

Indianapolis and Chicago-Midway Airports served as ATA hubs. Following the economic effects of September 11, 2001, the airline suffered financial setback after setback, until declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations on April 2, 2008, with flights still in the air.

During the bankruptcy, Southwest Airlines scooped up the ATA brand, its access at LaGuardia Airport, and the operating certificate for $7.5 million.

Aloha Airlines

The end of World War II and the purchase of a military surplus plane led to the 1946 creation of Aloha Airlines, which operated flights between the US mainland and Hawaii, and to other Pacific islands.

Aloha was the main competitor to Hawaiian Airlines, but it was a fare war with the now-defunct island-hopper airline ""go!"" that drove Aloha to declare bankruptcy and cease operations in 2008.

Transcend Air has plans for a jet-fast plane that takes off and lands vertically, allowing it to skip the crowded runway and land in city waterways.

Kingfisher Airlines

Travelers to India may be familiar with the Kingfisher brand of beer, but the name (and the beer's parent company) also entered the airline business, with Kingfisher Airlines commencing flights around India in 2005.

Its international service, to London, featured a bar in first class, and top-of-the-line entertainment systems and full-size pillows even in economy.

Consistent heavy financial losses drove Kingfisher to the brink of cessation several times, before the airline was forced to end operations in 2012 when India suspended its license and froze its accounts for non-payment of taxes.

Eos Airlines

The short-lived Eos Airlines, which existed only from 2004 to 2008, was an all-business-class carrier flying 48-seat Boeing 757s between New York-JFK and London's Stansted Airport.

It was a trend leader, heralding the slew of all-premium transatlantic airlines that also started up in the mid-2000s, like L'Avion, MAXJet and Silverjet. Before Eos could see through its plans to expand all-business-class flights to other US, European, and even South American destinations, the airline suddenly collapsed into bankruptcy.

Primera Air

Primera may have hit the headlines for its spectacularly terrible failure and stranding thousands of passengers (and even its own crew) when it ceased operations in October 2018 without warning, but the airline had been around since 2003 and was a successful charter operation before it pivoted to ultra-low-cost scheduled flights primarily on European holiday routes.

Primera's attempt to offer long-haul, transatlantic flights between the United States and Europe then literally got off the ground in April 2018, only to last a few months before the entire operation collapsed two years ago.

Monarch Airlines

Primera's failure came on the one-year anniversary of Monarch Airlines' own demise, which occurred on October 2, 2017.

The budget British airline, founded in 1967, flew vacationers to tourism hotspots around Europe, as well as to Israel.

Financial difficulties drove Monarch to desperately seek funding and, despite scoring some investment from Boeing in 2016, the airline shut down and stranded some 110,000 passengers who were later repatriated on other airlines in an operation costing £60 million ($78 million).

Air Berlin

Founded by Americans in 1978, Air Berlin initially operated holiday charter flights from West Berlin to Mediterranean vacation destinations. German reunification saw the airline rapidly expand, and Air Berlin became one of the largest European carriers.

Future plans and expansion hinged on eventually basing operations at Berlin's new Brandenburg Airport, which was originally due to open in 2011 but suffered rolling delays and is now not expected to open, if at all, until 2020.

Air Berlin scaled back on operations over several years and, with sustained financial losses, finally flew its final flight in October 2017. Nearly immediately Lufthansa swooped in and purchased 81 of its aircraft and employed more than 3,000 former Air Berlin employees, with Easyjet also taking a smaller piece of the Air Berlin pie.

Pan Am

The Pan Am Experience restaurant takes ""passengers"" back to the airline's '70s heyday complete with a four-course meal.

Pan Am, short for Pan American World Airways, is the story of a tiny, airmail carrier that hopped from Florida to Cuba and back beginning in 1927, to become the world's largest airline and an industry innovator until its demise in 1991.

Graduating from floatplanes to Boeing 747s, the airline pioneered flight routes, opened hotels (starting the InterContinental hotel chain), and symbolized the glamor of the jet age.

Oil crises, hijackings and attacks, and other operational setbacks forced Pan Am into dire financial straits, and the carrier ceased on December 4, 1991. Delta paid $1.39 billion to acquire Pan Am's assets, also honoring passenger tickets on the bankrupt carrier.

When low-cost airline literally and figuratively took off in the United States in the mid-2000s, United felt the pressure to try its own hand and thus formed Ted. The airline began flying all-economy Airbus A320s in 2004, with a hub at Denver International Airport.

In-flight entertainment on Ted flights was limited to ""Tedevision"" and ""TedTunes,"" and the airline sold teddy bears onboard. Ted's main competitors were Frontier Airlines and Delta's similar low-cost experiment, Song, and it lasted until 2009 when operations were folded back into United.

['Francesca Street'],"But airplanes are still flying, and travelers still traveling, albeit with extra bottles of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in carry-ons.

Still, as you board the aircraft and sit in your seat, you might find yourself reconsidering inflight hygiene -- and wondering just how thoroughly the aircraft's actually been cleaned before you boarded.

CNN Travel spoke to airlines, airplane companies and medical experts to find out what's been done to ensure you're flying in as hygienic an environment as possible, and what passengers can do for extra reassurance.

Normal cleaning procedure

Christian Rooney is the manager of JetWash Aero, a specialist aviation cleaning company based in the UK that's tasked with turning around aircraft between flights.

Rooney tells CNN Travel that the cleaning process varies depending on the schedule of the aircraft in question.

When aircraft downtime is very limited, some of what Rooney calls the ""very straightforward cleaning,"" such as removing old newspapers and passenger trash, will be done by the cabin crew at the end of the previous flight.

""A basic but more thorough cabin clean is usually carried out at night -- or when there is more downtime -- and it includes the cleaning of toilets, wiping down and disinfecting of trays, cleaning galleys, [overhead bins], seats etc. This may take up to an hour or longer,"" explains Rooney.

""An airline will also always schedule a 'deep interior clean' every month or six weeks. This clean takes several hours and is extremely thorough.""

Cleaning products and disinfectants are approved by aircraft manufacturers, says Rooney.

""Some of the disinfectants we use are effective against a wide range of pathogens and are known to inactivate complex viruses with similar properties to SARS, E. coli, avian flu, MRSA etc,"" he adds.

These offer antimicrobial protection for up to 10 days, he says.

Stephanie Biron, a recently retired flight attendant who used to work for American Airlines, tells CNN Travel that, in her experience, standards of aircraft cleaning would vary.

""A lot of times you come on and it's not terribly satisfactory, but you have to rely on the individuals doing their jobs, because that's what they've been paid to do,"" she says.

""Sometimes you come on and you have to go out and tell the agent, 'look, the plane looks terrible. We need somebody to come on and redo it.' It just varies all the time. Sometimes you come on in the morning and they deep cleaned the whole thing, or at least they told you they have.""

Passenger personal hygiene

Some airlines have requested additional measures due to the current climate, says Rooney.

""We have seen an uptick in the requirements and levels of disinfection, spraying and fumigation of the cabin, as the airlines look to address concerns over the coronavirus,"" he explains.

But Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in Vanderbilt University's division of infectious diseases, says that he doesn't think there's much more carriers can do to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Because transmission most often occurs person to person, the inanimate environment of the airplane isn't really the problem, says Schaffner.

It's still wise, he says, to wipe down surfaces -- but ultimately it's handwashing that is the most important preventative step.

""Even if there is virus in the inanimate environment, it's not going to jump off the seat and bite you in the ankle. You've got to touch it, and then touch your nose or your mouth,"" Schaffner explains.

""So it's those hands we have that are the important intermediary -- and that's where I would put the emphasis. Use those wipes on your hands. That's the important thing.""

Dr Paulo Alves, who is currently attending IATA's Aviation Resilience Health workshop in Singapore -- which is working to address the overall impact of COVID-19 -- agrees with Schaffner.

""The most effective, simple measure vacationers should implement is to wash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer should be used,"" says Alves.

""It seems reasonable to wipe the tray table surface, where it is more likely for droplets to land after someone coughs or sneezes. Travelers should maintain good personal hygiene on board flights, before flights and after flights and avoid touching their face.""

Travel medicine specialist Richard Dawood agrees, and says this advice stretches to navigating airports too. ""Remain aware of where your hands have been,"" he says.

Former flight attendant Biron also expresses concern not just for passengers -- but for air crew. They're just as likely to get sick, she points out, or feel pressured to still fly while unwell.

Airlines for America, the aviation group that represents North American carriers, says airlines are working closely with federal authorities -- and tells CNN Travel that the safety and security of passengers and crew ""is -- and always will be -- the top priority of US carriers.""

""I really don't think [airlines] can do very much. They might make the wipes more available to individuals,"" says Schaffner.

Airline response

Aircraft are cleaned on the ground, between flights. Spencer Platt/Getty Images

So what are airlines doing differently right now?

Brian Parrish, spokesman for Southwest Airlines, tells CNN Travel that Southwest aircraft undergo ""regular cleanings between flights and a comprehensive cleaning when aircraft are parked overnight.""

""Our cleaning program includes the disinfecting of all hard surfaces within the cabin, as well as seat and carpet cleaning,"" he says. ""Southwest will continue to monitor and follow all guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization regarding the coronavirus and make any adjustments to our procedures, as necessary.""

Curtis Blessing, an American Airlines spokesperson, echos Parrish.

""Our aircraft, including lavatories, are cleaned on a regular basis, and the depth of the cleaning varies depending on turn times and type of flying,"" he says. ""Lavatories are cleaned, floors are spot cleaned and visible trash is removed from seat pockets on all flights.""

Transcontinental, Hawaii and international flights see a deeper level of cleaning, Blessing adds.

Meanwhile, a Qantas spokesperson tells CNN Travel that the airline adopts ""the highest standard in cleaning and disinfecting our cabins, seats, galleys and washrooms.""

The spokesperson also highlights the HEPA filters which are part of the air conditioning system. ""These filters are used in hospital operating theaters, with air in the cabin replaced every three to five minutes. This provides much cleaner air than other public spaces like trains, restaurants, shopping centers and offices.""

This echoes the official advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that, due to the way air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, ""most viruses and other germs do not spread easily,"" but that travelers are still advised to ""avoid contact with sick passengers and wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains 60%-95% alcohol.""

Delta says on its website that it's been deploying a ""fogging technique"" since February, using ""a highly effective, EPA-registered disinfectant.""

Fogging is being used on all trans-Pacific Delta flights arriving into the US, with plans to expand those procedures to more inbound international flights, focusing on flights coming from places with reported coronavirus cases. Fogging has been taking place on all inbound Delta flights from Italy to New York-JFK and Atlanta since February 29.

Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific tells CNN Travel that aircraft cabin cleaning is always carried out to ""high standards"" -- but some extra precautions are currently in place.

""Out of an abundance of caution, aircraft will be taken out of service to perform extensive additional deep cleaning and supplementary disinfection when a confirmed case of coronavirus has been identified,"" says a Cathay Pacific spokesperson.

""This includes the replacement of all seat covers, disinfection of all surfaces and galley equipment, detailed cleaning of the lavatories, disinfection of carpets, sterilization of the water system and replacement of air filters in addition to standard cleaning procedures.""

Cathay Pacific has also temporarily suspended hot towels, pillows, blankets, magazines and in-flight duty-free on flights to and from destinations in mainland China.

Still, Schaffner says panicked passengers shouldn't feel they need to avoid using in-flight blankets or pillows if they are provided on their flight. There's ""no good data"" to support the idea they're responsible for transmission, he says.

""It's a consideration that comes logically to the mind, but it's difficult to convince people that they're really low risk. I always come back to the intermediate vehicle [which is] your hands. Do a lot of good hand-sanitizing.""

Alves agrees, pointing out that viruses will be eliminated when blankets and pillows are washed. However, he does clarify that there are ""knowledge gaps"" about the COVID-19 virus and research is ongoing, so recommendations may change.

Staying vigilant

So if you're boarding a flight soon, stocking up on hand sanitizer is the best move. Is there anything else to be done?

Schaffner notes that, from the passengers' point of view, the ultimate way to avoid infections on aircraft is to stay home.

""And there will come a time perhaps -- and some of that is happening already -- where we are being urged to social distance ourselves,"" he says. ""People are reconsidering whether they wish to fly at the moment.""

['Louise Watt'],"Taipei, Taiwan (CNN) — Hidden away in a dead-end alley, a skeleton perches on a bar stool with a wine glass and a cigarette. Grinning vacantly, he leans against a wall emblazoned with a quote from Franz Kafka: ""There is an infinite amount of hope in the universe ... but not for us.""

This is your welcome to "" The Misanthrope Society ,"" a bar that offers drinkers and diners a respite from other people.

Related content The world's best bar for 2019 revealed

The quirky addition to Taipei's bar scene serves up creative cocktails, black humor and a dislike of humankind.

Its cocktails sound bleak: ""Ghost Island Tea"" has Taiwanese Spring Vodka and Kavalan Whisky, plus dashes of tequila, kahlua, vermouth and lemon juice; ""Kafkaesque"" blends together ""Kaffe und Wodka"" and other spirits with root beer.

A mix of Midori, sake-based Mikanshu, cherry brandy and Absolut Vodka comes up with ""No Longer Human.""

The cocktails have names like ""Ghost Island Tea"" and ""Last Words."" courtesy The Misanthrope Society

If you order the gin-based ""Last Words,"" you are politely asked to write down what you will say on your deathbed to add to a pile of cards in the bar. ""Stay ridiculous,"" reads one.

The bar itself is characterized by dark humor and dark décor: black walls, a black menu, black plates -- even the fried chicken is black, after being marinated in traditional Taiwanese fermented bean curd, splashed with alcohol and set alight.

Diners are left to watch flames shooting out of what looks like black remains, a fried chicken dish that evokes the image of hell.

As if you didn't get the message, ""Hell is other people,"" the famous quote from Jean-Paul Sartre, is painted on a wall.

""You can hate this world as much as you want""

The anti-social theme of the bar belies its inclusiveness; the owner, who has suffered from severe depression, wanted to provide a space that was welcoming to others in need.

""We call it 'The Misanthrope Society,' which literally means you can hate this world as much as you want here,"" says Chen Xiaoguai.

""I want to attract people with the dark side,"" so they can then help each other and experience ""the warmth from different people,"" he adds.

""The Misanthrope Society"" is located in one of Taipei's most happening districts, bang in the middle of a bustling night market selling clothes and snacks, and less than a minute's walk from the Gongguan metro station.

But owner Chen has managed to find a space that is perfect for a bar that professes to hate human society, in a dark corner of a road that leads nowhere, where no sunshine reaches.

Inside, though, is some hidden human warmth.

Chen was inspired to open the bar after spending a month in a mental health hospital.

There he received specialist care from psychologists and other health professionals, but felt like the system stopped providing support after he was discharged.

""I think the most important thing in my case in stepping out from the dark side is the help from people, the friends I met in hospital,"" says Chen, who used to be an engineer.

""I want to replicate this peer support group.""

However, many people with depression choose not to drink alcohol because it makes their symptoms worse or mixes badly with their medication.

At The Misanthrope Society, you can get that sense of community without the booze, as the bar is also a coffee shop and bookstore, offering psychology books, autobiographies and novels about dark episodes in people's lives. Books lined up on a coffee bar include ""The Museum of Broken Relationships"" and ""Poetry About How Much I Hate My Life.""

Since opening the space in February last year, Chen says people ""came here to cry, to talk to me, to just stay, read my books.""

More than a dozen regulars who experience similar mental health issues have got to know each other and formed their own support network.

In Taiwan, mental health is not talked about much and is often still misunderstood and stigmatized.

""Before, these people probably can only talk to their family, their friends, who can't really understand them, especially our parents, the older generations, who have no idea or knowledge of mental health problems,"" says Chen, 28.

Older generations might suggest problems can be solved by talking to a temple official, or through superstition.

""The Misanthrope Society"" offers an outlet for all drinkers and diners to express their mood, and that starts with what you order.

The ""furiously stewed"" duck may appeal to those feeling angry, while the Scotch egg's Chinese name translates as ""withdraw into one's shell.""

Chen was once asked to create a cocktail for ""the feeling of being enslaved by society."" He created one ""opaque in color, strong in flavor.""

It would be wrong, perhaps, to call this an anti-bar, as many lone drinkers have sought out solace from other people in bars the world over.

['Andrea Lo'],"(CNN) — With a population of 602,000 , Luxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries -- yet it suffers from major traffic jams.

But that could be about to change. As of March 1, 2020 all public transport -- trains, trams and buses -- in the country is now free.

The government hopes the move will alleviate heavy congestion and bring environmental benefits, according to Dany Frank, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Mobility and Public Works.

Tiny country, big traffic

Landlocked Luxembourg is one of the richest countries in Europe, with the highest per capita GDP in the European Union

High housing costs, especially in Luxembourg City, mean more than 180,000 of its workforce commute from those neighboring countries every day.

""Luxembourg is a very attractive place for jobs,"" explains Geoffrey Caruso, a professor at the University of Luxembourg and the Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research specializing in land use and transportation.

But its ""booming economy"" and high concentration of jobs have led to congestion issues, he says.

That year, drivers in Luxembourg City spent an average of 33 hours in traffic jams. It fared worse than European cities Copenhagen and Helsinki , which have comparable population sizes to all of Luxembourg -- yet drivers in both only spent an average of 24 hours in traffic.

Park and rides around Luxembourg's borders in the three neighboring countries, however, will encourage commuters to use free mass transit, according to Frank.

Free transport for all

Luxembourg's public transport system covers the whole country and costs $562 million (€508 million) per year to run. Each year, it generates around $46 million in ticket sales, according to the ministry.

The government is putting up the cost of making it free, Frank says. ""The country at this very moment is in really good shape. We, the government, want the people to benefit from the good economy.""

Caruso is concerned that making transport free may unintentionally deter people who would normally walk or cycle in urban areas. ""Rather than walking 500 meters, you see a bus coming and you say, 'I (can) get on and travel 500 meters because it's free,'"" he says.

['Alec Snyder'],"(CNN) The National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to court documents.

The museum -- which was founded in 1976 and is a Smithsonian affiliate -- announced it will continue operating while undergoing reorganization, according to a news release issued Monday.

""The future is only likely to get better and brighter,"" interim CEO Misha Galperin told CNN on Monday. ""It's a very important, historic place where the nation was born and we're here to tell the nation what American Jews are grateful for, what was done for us in America and what we in turn contributed to the United States.""

Galperin said most of the museum's $30 million in debt stems from loans the museum took out to fund the construction of its new building on Independence Mall between 2008 -- at the height of the economic recession -- and 2010, when the building was completed. Outside funding levels declined sharply due to the recession, necessitating the loans, officials said.

""[Funding] didn't return until the levels of pre-2008 until about a year ago,"" Galperin said. ""In order to finish construction, the museum had to borrow money and we were hopeful we could repay the money. We never could.""

['Lilit Marcus'],"(CNN) — Earlier this year, a family of three women from New Zealand -- a mom and her two adult daughters -- made headlines around the world when they were denied the business class seats they'd paid for on a Thai Airways flight because they were too big to fit into them.

Ironically, the family -- Huhana Iripa and daughters Tere and Renell -- had purchased business class seats because they'd assumed those would be bigger and more comfortable.

But because Thai Airways' plane seat models made it impossible to put seatbelt extenders onto business class seats, the three women were moved into coach class and given seatbelt extenders.

While the Iripas' story went viral and resulted in a refund from the airline for the difference in cost between the business seats they'd paid for and the coach ones they ended up flying in, stories like these are not anomalies.

Related content Crystal Cabin Awards shortlist spotlights aircraft interiors of the future

As airplane seats continue to shrink, more and more people around the world find themselves unable to fit -- or else subject to invasive comments, touches and other humiliations by both airline employees and their fellow passengers.

Adding to the challenges, there is no universal standard in seat sizing for the airline industry. Every airline has different guidelines, meaning that even the best-informed consumers have trouble keeping up.

But there are ways to make flying -- which can be anxiety-producing for even the most mainstream traveler -- more humane for everyone on board, no matter what their body looks like.

The goalposts are moving

Annette Richmond is a body-positive activist and the founder of Fat Girls Traveling , a digital community that provides women with support, advice and resources about traveling with different body types.

As a self-described ""digital nomad"" with no official address, she has clocked thousands of hours in the sky and has dealt with a range of situations on board. She's also plus size herself.

Though her own number-one piece of advice is to do as much research as possible about your flight, carrier and seat ahead of time, she admits this can be challenging. The rules are frequently changing and not always posted in an easy-to-find place.

Related content What we resolve not to do on a plane in 2020

""(Airlines) intentionally make it difficult and make sure it takes time and money and effort for you to travel comfortably as a fat person, because they're there to make a profit,"" Richmond says.

Some countries have specific regulations about body size and air travel rights. For example, travelers flying on domestic flights within Canada who need two seats can get the cost of the second seat refunded if they have a doctor's note.

In Australia, the Australian Consumer Law prohibits airlines from charging passengers different amounts based on their body sizes.

Colorado-based startup Molon Labe Seating is developing a staggered seating design for commercial airlines which they claim provides passengers with more room and larger seats.

But in the United States, it's a gray area.

AirHelp.com is a US-based website that helps consumers take action against airlines in situations like these.

The company's chief legal officer, Christian Nielsen, says that passengers who have had negative interactions with airlines regarding seat size have to deal with regulations that change constantly or are difficult to articulate.

""There are not many laws to protect people who do not fit into shrinking airline seats,"" Nielsen tells CNN. ""There is no law currently in place (in the United States) to protect passengers who are bumped from their flight due to their size.""

When Lauren Haber Jonas founded Part + Parcel , a community platform and online retailer for plus size women, she was determined to make sure her company's values for her employees matched the ones they were instilling for their customers.

She vowed that any Part + Parcel employee on a work trip would be accommodated in their seat and travel preferences -- whether that means two seats, using extenders or anything else that a person of size would prefer to make flying more comfortable.

But she found that it was hard to know what the guidelines were in order to follow them.

""It's a disaster,"" she admits. ""Every airline has different configurations and policies, but every airplane has different seats. The age and the model of the plane, and if the model has been remodeled, and and and. I have found myself spending many hours looking at widths and dimensions of first class versus business class versus coach on every plane you can possibly imagine.""

It's not just about the seat

One thing is for sure: conversations around body size and airplane seat sizes aren't going away.

In December 2019, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine predicted that half of Americans will be obese by the year 2030, with one in four having a body mass index (BMI) of over 35.

But while bigger bodies are everywhere, that doesn't mean that social attitudes have changed.

""I feel like when you live your life in a marginalized body, a fat body or a disabled body or an older body, something that's outside of the generalized norm, you get used to being othered all the time and you have to walk through the world with an additional armor,"" says Richmond.

The term ""microaggressions"" is used to explain how little slights that might otherwise not seem like a big deal accumulate over time to turn into an issue.

For plus-size people, it's not just about one particular seat on one particular airplane.

Despite being an activist, Richmond can often get so worn down by the nonstop questions and comments -- from cabin crew, from fellow passengers, and even from total strangers -- that she just gives in.

Related content 9 things that will make flying on an airplane better

In one case, when she says was asked by a crew member to move out of an exit row seat despite being able to fit safely into the seatbelt, she just said yes to avoid a conflict and because she didn't want to have to ""prove"" her body was an acceptable size.

Richmond feels that the reason there hasn't been a significant movement to make travel more comfortable for people with larger bodies is because we live in a society that considers fatness a moral failing and something that doesn't deserve sympathy.

On the other side, for example, it's considered a positive trait to be tall -- so tall passengers who complain about lack of leg room are seen as having a more valid complaint.

""There are statistics all the time that say that 80 percent of people (in the United States) hate plus size people,"" says Haber Jonas. ""In being a plus size person, it's the sense that you did this to yourself. You made yourself fat, you created this body, it's imposing on me and it's your job to make yourself smaller.""

And tensions that could be resolved easily on the ground become urgent issues in the air, when there's no way for people to get away from each other and avoid sharing space.

Being stuck in a flying tube together often can turn a mildly uncomfortable situation into a crisis.

l e v a r t

""The fact that [air travel] gets worse and worse over time means that people are more and more pissed off. You enter the experience unhappy -- there are no plugs at the gate, the boarding experience is miserable, it's no wonder that you get upset. If you get upset about a person of size, it's about how it affects you and your life and your day, you don't think outside of yourself.""

Ultimately, it's much easier to get annoyed at a fellow passenger instead of pulling back and thinking about the structural issues in the aviation industry affect all travelers.

After all, you can't yell at a structural issue.

What happens next?

Unless there's a huge transformation of the airline industry, seat sizes and configurations aren't likely to change soon.

The time and cost involved in building aircraft mean that changes happen gradually, sometimes over years. And in-flight comfort is often sacrificed at the altar of the lowest fare.

For those in cattle class, enlisting a high-profile ally can often be a support.

In 2010, ""Clerks"" director Kevin Smith was removed from a Southwest Airways flight to Burbank because a crew member said he needed an additional seat.

Smith went on a rant against the airline, which he posted in a series of tweets.

""Dude, I know I'm fat,"" he said at the time. ""That's not why I was truly thrown off that plane, because I fit perfectly in the seat ... I am not fat enough to eject off a Southwest flight.""

Later, Southwest changed its policy, citing Smith's experience as part of their reason why. And, six years later, he flew the airline again with no issues.

Richmond also advocates for the power of community. Often, if a member of Fat Girls Traveling has had an issue with a specific airline or travel company, members will back each other up online.

Auckland: New Zealand's biggest and most culturally diverse city. Chris McLennan/Tourism New Zealand

There's lots to see and do in New Zealand's biggest and most culturally diverse city.

The 'City of Sails' sprawls around more than 40 volcanic cones and is surrounded by the island-strewn Hauraki Gulf.

Auckland has a metropolitan vibe, but it's also blessed with bountiful beaches, parks and places to get away from it all.

When you need a break from the hustle and bustle, walk to the top of Maungakiekie (Mt Eden). Here, just 5km from the CBD, you will enjoy panoramic views from the city's highest volcanic cone while sheep graze peacefully nearby.

Bonus trip: Make sure you include a trip to Waiheke Island -- just 40 minutes from the terminal in Auckland -l- for a complete change of pace. Waiheke is home to idyllic beaches, bushwalking trails and 20-odd vineyards.

Lake Taupo + Tongariro National Park

A lake the size of Singapore? Check. Volcanoes? Check. Bubbling mud and steaming hot water pools? Check. Bleak, barren desert landscapes? Check.

Lake Taupo and its surrounding landscapes read like they've been purpose-built for a tourism brochure. The freshwater lake, which is the biggest in Australasia, is a vast caldera formed by a super-volcanic eruption some 26,000 years ago.

At the southern end, three mighty volcanoes (Mounts Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngaruahoe) loom large. It's no wonder that nearby Tongariro National Park (a World Heritage Area) was used as the backdrop for some of the most stunning scenes in the Lord of the Rings films.

Many visitors choose to base themselves in Taupo, the town on the lake's northern shores. There's no shortage of outdoor experiences on offer here, including fishing, mountain biking, skydiving, jet-boating and bungee jumping.

In winter months, all eyes are on the mountains. There are two fields on Mount Ruapehu (Whakapapa and Turoa) and plenty of apres-ski fun to be had in the small town of Ohakune.

Bonus trip: Get up close (okay, not too close!) with steaming mineral pools and bubbling mud at the Tokaanu Thermal Walk (near Turangi, 40 minutes from Taupo), then take a dip in the healing waters of the nearby geothermal hot pools to soothe away any travel-induced aches and pains.

Lake Waikaremoana + Te Urewera

Remote and rugged Te Urewera is the largest protected tract of native forest in the North Island: Think dense, rugged bush, vast Lake Waikaremoana (formed more than 2000 years ago by a monumental landslide) and lots of potential for fishing, tramping, camping and hunting.

It's home to the Ngati Tuhoe tribe (nicknamed 'the Children of the Mist') and most species of New Zealand's native birds. If you're looking for somewhere to completely switch off, this is it.

To exercise body as well as mind, consider hiking the complete Lake Waikaremoana Track.

This trail, one of New Zealand's 'Great Walks,' traces the western side of the lake and takes around four days. Expect giant podocarp forests, remote beaches and incredible views. There are plenty of shorter hikes if you're pressed for time.

['Hollie Silverman'],"(CNN) — Travelers entering the United States will face new protocols as cases of novel coronavirus grow around the world.

The US is expanding travel restrictions from Iran and heightening a travel advisory for certain regions of South Korea and Italy, Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday. Meantime, President Trump in a tweet on Sunday announced new screening procedures for people traveling from ""high-risk countries.""

New screening methods

There was already a ban on travel related to Iran, but the administration said Saturday that it is being expanded ""to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days."" As of Monday morning, there have been 978 cases of coronavirus in Iran and 54 deaths.

The US is also increasing the travel advisory for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level -- advising Americans not to travel to specific regions in those countries hit hardest by the virus, Pence announced through the State Department.

""Additionally we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy , and other European Nations as needed,"" Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence, told CNN Sunday when asked to clarify what Trump meant by ""high risk.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the goal is to lower the travel to and from the most impacted areas in an attempt to control the spread of the virus.

Screening is already in place for those traveling from China. Anyone who has been in China within the last 14 days requires screening.

Trump on Saturday warned Americans that although more cases are ""likely,"" most healthy people who contract the illness will recover and the risk to the average American remains low. And Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that while the administration knows there will be more cases and that it's possible Americans could die from the disease, ""the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low.""

Additional restrictive measures were announced in January and are scheduled to take effect starting at 5 p.m. ET on Monday. Those include that US citizens and permanent residents returning to the United States who have traveled to Iran within the previous 14 days must enter trough an approved airport. Foreign nationals who have traveled to Iran within the last 14 days will be denied permission to travel to the US.

['Lilit Marcus'],"(CNN) — A suburban London street has been renamed in honor of late musician Freddie Mercury

The street, now called Freddie Mercury Close , is located in Feltham, west London, which is where Mercury's family settled after moving from Zanzibar.

However, Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara, did not grow up on that street. The Bulsara family lived nearby at 22 Gladstone Avenue, which is marked with one of the round blue plaques that the UK uses to commemorate places that have historical connections.

The neighborhood, which is close to Heathrow Airport, is also home to a community of Zoroastrians -- the faith that Mercury's family practiced.

Before forming the rock band Queen in 1970, Farrokh Bulsara worked as a baggage handler at the airport.

A close friend of Freddie Mercury released a new version of the Queen frontman singing ""Time Waits for No One,"" accompanied only by a piano.

['Joshua Mellin'],"(CNN) — The Japanese macaques in Jigokudani Monkey Park begin most days with a relaxing dip in their own private hot tub.

Located in Joshinetsu Kogen National Park in Japan's Nagano prefecture, the primate-only onsen is world-famous as the preferred simian hot spring.

But life hasn't always been so simple for the snow monkeys of Jigokudani (""The Valley of Hell,"" named for its natural hot springs). They were initially forced from their habitat in the 1950s by the development of nearby ski resorts.

As a result, they moved into nearby towns and quickly found trouble, raiding fruit from local farmers' orchards. The farmers petitioned the government and were granted the right to hunt the animals.

Legend has it, the manager of Kourakukan, a nearby ryokan (a traditional Japanese inn), began feeding the animals in 1957. Enlisting the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University, the inn's manager put the monkeys on the radar of researchers as well as a Nagano Railway Company worker and local nature enthusiast, Sogo Hara.

Hara and his group visited the ryokan, which included outdoor onsen for guests' enjoyment. One day in 1961, so the story goes, an errant apple fell into the human's onsen. A young monkey tested the steamy water and emerged with the apple. He didn't exit the waters immediately, though, and many of the monkeys looked on as their buddy quietly enjoyed the water.

l e v a r t

It wasn't long before other young monkeys began mimicking the water-loving monkey's behavior.

Within months, all of the female monkeys had taken to bathing in the hot springs.

This soon led to the establishment of the Jigokudani Monkey Park in 1964, thanks to the efforts of many invested parties. Today, this is where the snow monkeys live, freely soaking in their dedicated hot springs peacefully.

Damage resulting from Typhoon No. 19 had impacted the spring's water levels and temperature but restoration work is now underway and the park is open to tourists.

The Jigokudani Facebook page offers daily updates on the restoration work and presence of the monkeys.

A relaxing soak

The snow monkeys' onsen practice isn't solely about warming their bodies or bobbing for apples -- like the Japanese and visitors to Japan, they seem to appreciate onsen for its stress-reducing properties.

Since the macaque's thick coats keep them warm, and they take a dip even when there are no apples in sight, researchers' studying the monkeys at Jigokudani believe hot springs function primarily to ease their tension.

Staff encourage the macaques to keep the park's onsen in their daily routine, offering a steady diet of soybeans, barley and, of course, apples.

Researchers also discovered the monkeys' indifference to the nearly 500 daily visitors to the park. In other words, their stress hormones did not increase as the number of park visitors increased.

Even during the busy tourist season, the monkeys meander nonchalantly about the park, climbing in and out of the hot spring as humans snap photos and ooh and ahh in delight.

Unlike some of Japan's other open animal experiences, such as Nara Deer Park, touching or feeding the monkeys is strictly prohibited. But this rule doesn't detract from the joy of sitting poolside as the macaque play leapfrog.

Meet the monkeys

Since the monkeys don't swim every day (in spite of their warm fur coats, they seem to prefer the hot springs on colder days), visitors will want to plan accordingly before heading north to the park.

A flexible itinerary is best, and January and February are prime visiting months. Fresh snow is ideal -- the monkeys are at home and perhaps at their playful best in the snowy climate. If you're lucky, you might even catch baby monkeys wrestling and making snowballs.

Time of day is a critical piece of planning, too: Jigokudani Monkey Park requires an overnight stay to catch the monkey's early morning soak. While it is possible to do it as a day trip from Tokyo, even catching the earliest train will make for a later arrival, when crowds are at their greatest, and that's if everything goes off without a hitch. If you miss seeing the monkeys, you'll wish you had allowed for more time.

The park opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. daily, with extended hours from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. seasonally.

What started out as a dip to grab a fallen apple has evolved into something much sweeter: monkey bathing. Courtesy Joshua Mellin

You're better off arriving the night before you plan to visit. Stay at a ryokan, delight in its onsen and take off for the park first thing in the morning. If you can, leave time for onsen exploration beyond your ryokan, for at the base of the mountain leading to the park is a main street packed with nine unique onsens for weary travelers.

Each meant to aid a particular ailment, the onsen encourage visitors to walk the charming street in a yukata (light kimono) and wooden sandals to collect stamps on a towel passport from all the onsens. Doing so is believed to ward off evil spirits and bring divine favor. The thin strip contains no shortage of mom-and-pop restaurants eager to share their house-made versions of Japanese staples.

Getting there

Most of these inns offer complimentary morning shuttles to the Jigokudani Monkey Park's information center. To best even these crowds, early risers can trek up the scenic path themselves for a chance at some private time with the monkeys.

From the information center, the monkey's onsen is only accessible via a one-mile path through the forest, about 30 minutes each way. Unfortunately, Jigokudani Monkey Park is not accessible to wheelchairs as the final ascent consists of tight winding paths and steep steps.

Jigokudani Monkey Park's pool-side views offers visitors a delightful insight into this unique behavior. Relaxing with the chilled-out macaques is a quintessential excursion from Japan's mega-cities.

Getting to Jigokudani Monkey Park from Tokyo requires an hour and a half ride on the shinkansen (high speed train) to Nagano, then a 50-minute trip on a local train to Yudanaka station in Yamanouchi, the town the park is located in.

['Rob Picheta'],"London (CNN) — The British government's contentious plans to build a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport have been blocked by an appeals court on environmental grounds, in a landmark victory for climate campaigners.

Judges in the closely-watched case at London's Court of Appeal said the UK government, which threw its support behind the proposal, had failed to take into account what impact the move would have on Britain's commitments under the Paris Agreement.

The decision could scupper plans to expand one of the world's busiest airports, and was celebrated on the court's steps on Thursday by a number of climate groups that had brought the legal action against the UK's Transport Secretary.

The court did not rule on the legality of a third runway itself, and Heathrow said it would appeal at the Supreme Court -- but the British government said it would not contest the verdict.

The ultimate decision over whether to fight for a third runway lies with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has long opposed the idea and once said he would ""lie down in front of the bulldozers"" to stop it going ahead.

""We have not found that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the United Kingdom's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change under the Paris Agreement, or with any other policy the Government may adopt or international obligation it may undertake,"" the judges wrote in their ruling.

""The Paris Agreement ought to have been taken into account by the Secretary of State... and an explanation given as to how it was taken into account, but it was not,"" they added.

The accord pushes signatories to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2C by the end of the century.

London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, had supported the legal action and welcomed the decision on Thursday. ""We won!"" Khan tweeted after the ruling. ""A new runway at Heathrow would have serious consequences on climate change, on air quality, on noise pollution, on road and rail networks and on the quality of life in our city,"" he added in a statement.

Campaigners celebrate the ruling on Thursday. Leon Neal/Getty Images

The move marks a new period of uncertainty in the lengthy and controversial debate over whether to build a third runway at the site -- which would have made Heathrow the world's busiest airport by current statistics.

After the verdict, the UK's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government will look elsewhere in exploring expansion and would not fight the decision.

""Airport expansion is core to boosting global connectivity. We also take seriously our commitment to the environment. This Govt won't appeal today's judgement given our manifesto makes clear any #Heathrow expansion will be industry led,"" he wrote on Twitter.

However, a statement from Heathrow Airport said the issue identified by the court is ""eminently fixable.""

""We will appeal to the Supreme Court on this one issue and are confident that we will be successful. In the meantime, we are ready to work with the Government to fix the issue that the court has raised,"" the airport's spokesperson said in a statement.

Lawmakers approved the proposal in 2018, but strong resistance from climate campaigners and those living near the site has loomed over the project.

The new airstrip would cross over the M25 motorway, London's busy and regularly congested outer ring road. About 750 homes in the villages of Longford, Sipson and Harmondsworth could be flattened to make way.

Johnson opposed the runway while he was Mayor of London -- should he decide to accept the court's judgment now, plans to build the airstrip would likely be doomed.

'This has wider implications'

Thursday's case was brought to the court by groups including Friends of the Earth, which described Thursday's ruling as ""an absolutely ground-breaking result for climate justice"" -- and climate groups seized on the decision as a sign of rapidly shifting attitudes towards the climate.

""This judgment has exciting wider implications for keeping climate change at the heart of all planning decisions,"" Will Rundle, head of legal at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. ""It's time for developers and public authorities to be held to account when it comes to the climate impact of their damaging developments.""

""It would have been hard to imagine this outcome even a couple of years ago,"" added Tim Crosland, director of the Plan B. Earth, which was involved in the case. ""But as the scale and impacts of the ecological crisis become clearer, with people dying and being displaced in the UK and around the world, it's vital we reject the politics of division and unite amidst adversity.""

The move was also hailed by Extinction Rebellion, whose frequent protests in London and around the world have become a notable feature of the growing climate movement.

And legal experts said the decision could be replicated around the world, as governments battle tensions between economic agendas with concerns over man-made damage to the climate.

""The last year has seen a surge in litigation across the globe associated with the effects and risks of climate change,"" Mary Anne Roff, a partner at the London law firm Clyde & Company, said in remarks sent to CNN.

Nor have they decided that a national policy statement supporting this project is necessarily incompatible with the UK's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change,"" she added.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/_KXYEa0sEAA/index.html,CNN,Travel,TRUE

So will the Skynest actually take flight?

There's reason to be hopeful. After all, this is the airline that's already proved its commitment to making economy class more comfortable, given so many of its flights are long-haul. It launched the ""Economy Skycouch"" in 2011, allowing passengers traveling together to transform their seats into a bed.

Staff from Air New Zealand tell CNN Travel no formal certification application is in process yet, ""however we have designed the concept to meet all regulatory requirements.""

['Marnie Hunter'],"(CNN) — Basic economy is fine if you're a solo airline passenger willing to roll the dice on a middle seat. For families, the lowest airfare class can be problematic.

Without seat assignments -- which increasingly come with a fee attached -- children may end up separated from their parents.

That's unacceptable, says Consumer Reports' advocacy arm.

Thursday, the non-profit research, media and advocacy organization posted an online petition ""demanding airlines put safety over profits.""

""Children 13 or under should sit with their families while flying, and should not be charged extra fees to do so,"" the petition reads. USA Today first reported on the petition.

By late Monday afternoon, the petition was approaching 50,000 signatures.

""Children need a responsible adult around and whether it's just so they can go to the bathroom in the middle of the flight or if there's an emergency, it's not safe to have a child without somebody there to take care of them,"" said Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumer Reports' advocacy arm.

""And no business traveler or solo traveler wants to be put in charge of a 3-year-old they don't know, and no parent wants to be seated, strapped in unable to move, that far from their child,"" she said.

If there's an emergency evacuation and a child is seated 10 rows behind their parent, ""no one believes that parent is going to calmly move forward and get off the plane"" without their child, Laitin said.

Seating issues

In 2016, the family seating issue aboard airlines was addressed in a Federal Aviation Administration bill passed by Congress that called upon airlines to look at seating children 13 and younger next to an accompanying family member at no additional cost.

The bill left some wiggle room, calling for such a policy ""if appropriate.""

Laitin says a couple of years went by with no word from the Department of Transportation on the issue.

So in September 2018, Consumer Reports filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out what action had been taken.

About a year later, the DOT responded with information it had gathered from airlines and enclosed 136 complaints it had collected from consumers over a period of about two and a half years.

""While that's not enormous in numbers compared to what they get on other things, (the complaints) were very striking,"" Laitin said. ""We're talking about 1- and 2-year-olds, we're talking about children with autism, families just having an enormous amount of problems getting seated with their children.""

The DOT decided not to direct airlines to establish family seating policies ""based on the low number of complaints received and review of airline family seating policies,"" the agency said on its website in a posting from September 2019.

Consumer Reports set up a portal in November 2019 letting consumers know they could complain about family seating issues to the DOT, copying Consumer Reports. Since that went live, about 450 complaints have been logged, Laitin said.

Airline policies

Consumer Reports' petition specifically calls out American, Delta and United.

The airlines offer basic economy fares that don't include seat assignments. The airlines have pop-up alerts around those fares to ensure that passengers are aware of those restrictions.

United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart said the carrier has adjusted its family seating procedures and policies.

In the summer of 2019, modifications were made to its seating engine ""to ensure that whenever possible that we assign children to a seat adjacent to an adult traveling on the same PNR, which is the passenger name record,"" Hobart said.

""We've essentially rolled out automatically seating families together. So we automatically scan for families who do not have seats assigned next to each other and we work to seat them together,"" Hobart said.

In cases where seats are not already assigned, the airline can make adjustments at the gate or on board the aircraft, he said.

""It's in our interest to have families sit next to each other, and it's clearly something that families care about. And we want to ensure that when they do travel with us they have a safe, friendly, enjoyable experience and this is one of ways that we can help make that happen,"" Hobart said.

Delta Air Lines encourages customers with seating questions to contact the airline ""as soon as possible to allow for the opportunity to address their concerns.""

""Regardless of the type of ticket purchased, Delta works with customers on a case-by-case basis to ensure their travel needs are met,"" the airline said in a statement.

American Airlines has been developing a process to ensure children younger than 15 are seated with an adult family member, the airline said in a statement.

""For families traveling with a child under the age of 15 who don't have a seat assignment, our system will work to seat the child with an adult in the reservation starting 48 hours after the reservation is ticketed. This ensures the child will not be assigned a seat alone,"" the statement said.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/1Dd3EfLkmHM/index.html,CNN,Travel,TRUE
['Katia Hetter'],"(CNN) — United Airlines had to swap out Boeing 777 aircraft for a Saturday flight from Newark to Hawaii, resulting in a reduction of business class seats.

These aren't the passengers an airline wants to annoy.

So the airline offered miles to passengers willing to sit in a lower class of seating on the Boeing 767-300 for the 11-hour plus direct flight.

Lots of miles.

Nine passengers accepted $10,000 in travel voucher compensation each for a total of $90,000.

""Occasionally we have to change aircraft at the last minute and when that happens, we try to do the right thing and make the impact to customers as minimal as possible,"" United spokeswoman Maddie King told CNN Travel.

King confirmed that nine business class passengers volunteered to sit in a ""Premium Plus"" cabin, which offers passengers more legroom and other benefits not found in a regular coach cabin.

But she declined to confirm the compensation amount, which the ""View from the Wing"" travel blog reported as $10,000 worth of travel vouchers per passenger.

""I do think this is a lot of money, but it doesn't surprise me,"" said Peter Sasaki, who's flown more than a million United miles and has invitation-only elite Global Services status with the airline. ( The exact qualifications for this program aren't published, but it's given to some of the airline's most profitable customers.)

""It is probably better to get the pax (passengers) to their destination at any cost rather than bump them and risk the cost of food, lodging, a rebook and bad PR, given how full flights are this time of year.""

Travelers involuntarily bumped from US flights can be entitled to compensation if they have confirmed reservations, check in to their flights online, arrive at the departure gate on time -- if their airline can't get them to their destination within one hour of the original flight's arrival time, according to the US Department of Transportation.

Passengers on US domestic flights experiencing a one to two hour delay in their arrival times can receive compensation equal to double the one-way price of their bumped flight -- up to $675.

Domestic passengers experiencing more than a two-hour delay on flights will receive payments of four times the one-way value of their flight -- up to $1,350.

['Katia Hetter'],"(CNN) — Think your driver's license is enough to get you through airport security in the United States and onto your domestic flight?

Maybe not.

Some two-thirds of US state driver's licenses are not compliant with a post-9/11 security law set to go into effect on October 1. Those who are not compliant will not be able to fly if they don't have other forms of ""REAL ID-compliant"" identification.

Concerned about the impact on travel, the head of the US Department of Homeland Security loosened the restrictions this week, allowing the various state agencies to accept identity documents electronically.

""Ensuring every state is REAL ID compliant by October is one of the Department's top priorities,"" said DHS Acting Secretary Chad Wolf, in a press release. ""While progress has been made, the real work is still ahead because approximately two-thirds of all licenses are presently not compliant with REAL ID.

""Rest assured, our Department will continue to examine other viable options to improve upon this process and continues doing everything it can to inform Americans of the requirement to obtain a REAL ID before the full enforcement deadline later this year.""

Todd Hauptli, CEO of the American Association of Airport Executives, shows his REAL ID-compliant driver's license during a news conference at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on October 1, 2019. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

While Wolf says this ""pre-submission"" of documents will result in a faster application process, it's not clear how much faster it will be.

That's because, as Wolf says, ""an in-person visit is still required, as is showing up with physical copies of your documents.""

Starting October 1, travelers must have a ""REAL ID-compliant"" driver's license, US passport, US military ID or other acceptable identification to fly within the United States.

The REAL ID Act, which established minimum security standards for the issuing of state licenses and their production, prohibits federal agencies from accepting licenses from states not meeting those minimum standards for certain activities.

To get a REAL ID-compliant state driver's license, the DHS requires applicants provide documentation showing their full legal name, their date of birth, their Social Security number, two proofs of address of principal residence and lawful status. States may impose more requirements.

If you can't produce acceptable identification, your US airport's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint will not clear you for flight. The TSA is part of the Department of Homeland Security. That could lead to serious backups at US airports starting October 1.

While many states have been issuing compliant documents for years, travelers shouldn't assume their driver's licenses and other documents meet the requirements. For example, Georgia became compliant in 2012 and California became compliant in 2018, but their driver's licenses issued prior to those times in those states are not compliant.

Check if your state driver's license or identification card is REAL ID compliant simply by looking for a star in the upper right-hand corner. Some state departments of motor vehicles will confirm REAL ID status online.

Still a backlog

The Department of Homeland Security reported this week that 48 of 50 states in the US are REAL ID compliant, up from January 2017, when only 26 states were. The two remaining states that haven't started issuing new IDs are Oklahoma and Oregon.

Collectively, those 48 states have issued more than 95 million REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses and ID cards.

While the US Travel Association applauded the government's ""pre-submission,"" decision, ""the challenge remains that tens of millions of Americans do not yet possess REAL ID-compliant identification,"" said Tori Emerson Barnes, USTA executive vice president of public affairs and policy, in a statement.

A post 9/11 measure

The REAL ID Act's requirement were part of the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the federal government set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Since the act's 2005 passage, the federal government has implemented TSA Pre-Check and other programs that offer more security than REAL ID, said Barnes. That's why the USTA is lobbying federal authorities to accept membership in those programs as a substitute for REAL ID. (DHS hasn't said yes, at least not yet.)

US House Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Arizona) and Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Florida) have introduced legislation that would allow the TSA to accept membership in its Pre-Check program as a substitute for REAL ID.

Officials at USTA, which represents major airlines, hotels, state and local tourism boards and other travel industry members, worry that their members will lose customers who suddenly can't fly within the US starting October 1, 2020.

"['Paul P. Murphy', 'Hollie Silverman']","(CNN) — As Americans are being urged to keep their distance from one another, travelers returning on flights from Europe say they are being made to wait for hours in close quarters at US airports to get screened for coronavirus.

When they arrived at airports in Dallas, Chicago and New York, they faced long lines and confusion, several travelers told CNN.

President Donald Trump has announced foreign nationals in 26 European countries will face restrictions entering the US, while Ireland and the United Kingdom will be added to the list at midnight Monday.

The ban went into effect at midnight Friday, but only after the original announcement sparked chaos at European airports as Americans sought ways to return home before it went into place.

Director of National Institute of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci tells CNN's Brianna Keilar that he would like to see people avoid crowds and says those trying to return to the US from overseas should not all return immediately.

American citizens and permanent residents are allowed to fly into the US but must to go through one of 13 transit airports for screening, which caused backups at some of the airports.

Karen Rogers, a passenger returning from Paris by way of London, had been waiting in line for at least five hours to be screened at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and was told she would have at least another hour to go, she said Saturday night.

CNN has reached out to O'Hare International Airport but did not receive an immediate response.

US Customs and Border Protection is aware of the long lines and is already seeing success addressing the delays at some airports, acting commissioner Mark Morgan said in a statement.

""We're continuing to balance our efficiencies with ensuring the health and safety of all American citizens,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than the safety, health and security of our citizens.""

'Very close quarters'

The process in place at O'Hare has passengers ""essentially go(ing) through customs twice,"" said Ann Lewis Schmidt, a passenger returning from Iceland.

Passengers first wait in line to have their passports checked and to turn in a declaration form and medical forms for those returning from Europe, South Korea, Iran and China, Schmidt said.

Then they are taken to a separate line to undergo a screening and temperature check.

Passengers are grouped together for hours during the process, Schmidt said.

""Seems backwards, as if someone had a fever they should have been never allowed in these lines for four hours,"" Schmidt told CNN.

She described folks being in ""very close quarters ... so if we didn't have the virus before, we have a great chance of getting it now!""

Travelers who pass the screening are instructed to immediately self-quarantine at home and monitor their health as outlined in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's best practices, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Illinois governor calls on federal government to take action

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker reacted to the news of long lines by tweeting to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, ""The crowds & lines O'Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately. @realDonaldTrump @VP since this is the only communication medium you pay attention to -- you need to do something NOW. These crowds are waiting to get through customs which is under federal jurisdiction.""

Prtizker has spoken with local officials and is working to get the federal government to resolve the issue, he said.

""The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW,"" he tweeted.

In a tweet, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf acknowledged the long lines and the stress passengers were experiencing.

""DHS is aware of the long lines for passengers who are undergoing increased medical screening requirements. Right now we are working to add additional screening capacity and working with the airlines to expedite the process,"" he said.

""I understand this is very stressful. In these unprecedented times, we ask for your patience. It currently takes ~60 seconds for medical professionals to screen each passenger. We will be increasing capacity but the health and safety of the American public is first & foremost.""

Passengers told to share pens

At John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, passengers are also facing long wait times.

Katelyn Deibler landed at JFK from Kiev, Ukraine, on Saturday afternoon and it took more than two hours to complete customs, she said.

She was given two forms to fill out when she arrived, she said.

""One was just name, passport number, flight number, seat, address, emergency contact, and details about your trip,"" Deibler said.

CNN's Kristen Holmes describes what it was like in the White House briefing room when reporters had their temperatures checked ahead of a press conference with President Trump.

The second form asked specific questions about symptoms and travel to coronavirus hot zones, she said.

The form instructs passengers to circle countries they visited in the last 14 days and asks if they've had any symptoms such as fever, coughing or difficulty breathing, Deibler said.

There were not enough copies for all the passengers on the flight, and many had to wait for more forms to be handed out.

""They didn't have pens and told us to share,"" she said. ""Which sounds like a great thing in the middle of the pandemic.""

Three taken to the hospital after screenings at JFK

Another traveler, Nick Carlin, also expressed concern passengers were told to share pens, and there was no hand sanitizer at JFK, he said.

""It definitely was a little scattered and disorganized,"" said Chris Nadolne, a passenger who arrived to JFK. ""I can see how people would start to get frustrated as the line got longer. ... No bathrooms nearby and no antibacterial around for people to use -- unlike in the UK and Paris where it is everywhere.""

At least three passengers who underwent screenings at JFK were sent to hospitals because of their symptoms, a source with knowledge of the JFK screenings said.

The average wait time for a health screening has been two hours, said Frank Russo, the JFK port director for US Customs and Border Control. There are more than 50 emergency medical technicians on duty supplementing CDC staff, he said.

Asked about passengers' complaints of the airport lacking hand sanitizer, he said the terminals have hand sanitizer and officers are instructing people how to find it. He has asked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- which operates the airport -- to install more dispensers in the areas where passengers are waiting, he said.

Passengers were intermingling while waiting in lines

Upon landing at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport , Kimberly Harris witnessed passengers who were in line for CDC screening skip the queue and join international passengers who did not need to be screened, she said. Harris returned from Johannesburg, South Africa, via London.

She watched the customs line grow and wrap around the entire floor, she said. ""It was difficult to tell where the line began and ended,"" Harris said. ""It almost (was) immediately evident that people who had to stay behind on the plane due to visiting a listed country were integrated into the line of the people who did not require additional screening.""

It took her three hours to make it through passport control and customs, she said. Another passenger who arrived at DFW on Sunday from Thailand by way of Doha, Qatar, described a similar scene. The coronavirus screening line was not separated from the other international arrivals, Matthew Thomas said.

""(They were) right next to us,"" he says. ""We were crowded and there for hours.""

Neither Thomas nor Harris required screenings.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_travel/~3/kbAKaK0Y0z4/index.html,CNN,Travel,TRUE
,"Prepare but do not panic is the guiding mantra, PM Modi said during the video conference

India can start with an ""initial offer"" of $10 million, he said during a telephonic conversation with SAARC leaders to evolve a joint strategy to fight the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 5,000 people worldwide.

Outlining the plan, the Prime Minister said, ""We are assembling a Rapid Response Team of doctors and specialists in India, along with testing kits and other equipment. They will be on stand-by, to be placed at your disposal, if required"".

India, he added, had also set up an Integrated Disease Surveillance Portal to better trace possible virus carriers and the people they contacted. ""We could share this Disease Surveillance software with SAARC partners, and training on using this,"" he said.

India, PM Modi said, has made special efforts to reach out to groups vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus and worked to quickly ramp up capacity in the system including through training of medical staff.

""'Prepare, but don't panic' has been our guiding mantra. We have to avoid knee-jerk reactions,"" the Prime Minister said, adding that the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) region has so far seen 150 cases. ""But we need to remain vigilant,"" he added.

Earlier, announcing his idea of a collaboration among the SAARC nations, the Prime Minister had tweeted: ""Timely action for a healthier planet. Tomorrow at 5 PM, leaders of SAARC nations will discuss, via conferencing, a roadmap to fight the challenge of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. I am confident that our coming together will lead to effective outcomes and benefit our citizens"".

Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has thanked Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for ""championing the cause of deprived workers"" after an audio clip of her lashing out at State Bank India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar went viral, triggering a major controversy.

In the leaked audio clip apparently recorded by one of those present at a meeting last month in Guwahati, Ms Sitharaman is heard shouting at Mr Kumar for botched paperwork involving accounts of tea garden workers, calling SBI ""inefficient"" and ""a heartless bank"", reports said.

""Don't tell me you are the largest bank. You are a heartless bank. SLBCs (State Level Bankers' Committees) don't function like this,"" she is heard as saying. ""Yeh nahin chalega (this can't go on),"" she appears to be saying twice targeting the SBI chairman.

""Sarkar kar rahi, Pradhan mantra ji bol rahe hain ke bagan mein kaam karne wale workers... You should have approached the department, made the department talk to RBI,"" Ms Sitharaman said.

""I am sorry to be sounding so harsh. I will see what I can do with RBI... But nothing makes up for your inefficiency... Let me be very blunt on this... It's your inefficiency which cost it,"" she said.

According to reports, Ms Sitharaman's outburst came over the lapses in KYC or Know Your Customer processes for bank accounts of tea garden workers that prevented them from receiving funds transferred by the government under its direct benefit transfer scheme.

After the audio clip of the meeting emerged, the All India Bank Officers Confederation condemned the incident in a statement but later withdrew it.

""Through this communique, we once again convey our deep anguish and resentment to the Union Finance Minister for treating the Chairman of State Bank of India in such an unfair manner,"" a statement by the organisation had said.

""We are of the view that representatives of the people should abstain from indulging in such misdemeanour with any top level executive of the public sector banks,"" it added.

According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, special excise duty on petrol was hiked by Rs 2 to Rs 8 per litre, and to Rs 4 a litre from Rs 2 in case of diesel. Additionally, road cess was raised by Re 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10.

Petrol and diesel prices were reduced in the metros on Sunday, March 15, by 12-14 paise as oil companies moderated rate reduction.

Referring to the Madhya Pradesh political crisis, Mr Gandhi had last week attacked PM Modi in a tweet.

""Hey @PMOIndia, while you were busy destabilising an elected Congress government, you may have missed noticing the 35 per cent crash in global oil prices. Could you please pass on the benefit to Indians by slashing petrol prices to under 60 per litre? Will help boost the stalled economy,"" he had tweeted.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/over-petrol-price-rahul-gandhis-genius-jibe-at-pm-modi-finance-minister-2195244,NDTV,Top Stories,TRUE
,"Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad is known for his role in the anti-CAA protests.

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad -- one of the most prominent faces of countrywide protests against the citizenship law -- today launched his political group, which he called the ""Azad Samaj Party"". The launch took place on the birth anniversary of BSP founder and Dalit icon Kanshi Ram. The Bhim Army, Mr Azad said, will run parallel to the party and continue to fight for Dalit rights and enrol new members.

The party flag is a white band between two blue strips, with Azad Samaj Party written in the middle.

News agency Press Trust of India reported that earlier today, the Bhim Army members claimed the police locked the gates of the venue and pasted a notice, which read, ""Event cannot be held as large gatherings are prohibited in view of coronavirus"". The gate, however, was opened later.

Mr Azad rose to political prominence during the clashes between Thakurs and Dalits in Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur three years ago. Last year, he filed nomination against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi, but later, withdrew from the contest.

Since December, as the protests against the contentious citizenship law started, he has been one of the most vocal leaders against it.

Late last year, he was arrested by the Delhi police after violence at an anti-CAA march that started in the Walled City of Delhi. Mr Azad – who addressed the protesters at the Jama Masjid just before the march started – was charged with arson, rioting and inciting violence. He was also barred from entering Delhi for four weeks.

The advocate-turned-politician has been critical of Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, accusing her of ""not doing enough for the Dalits"". Mayawati had earlier termed Azad a ""BJP agent"" and cautioned her supporters not to ""fall prey to his designs"".",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-launches-political-group-azad-samaj-party-2195262,NDTV,Top Stories,TRUE

Some unidentified people allegedly fled with a BMW car after the man driving it pulled up to urinate on a roadside, police said on Sunday.

Asked if the stock broker would be charged for drunken driving, Mr Chander told news agency PTI: ""The priority is to recover the BMW and ensure arrest of the culprits. It's a serious concern that somebody's car gets stolen like this on city roads.""

Mr Arora has alleged in his complaint that the men, who had arrived on a motorcycle, had put a gun on his back while he was relieving himself but that claim is yet to be verified since he was ""highly drunk"", according to officials.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah has assured that the political leaders still under detaintion in Jammu and Kashmir will be released ""very soon"", the newly formed Apni Party's president Altaf Bukhari said in Delhi on Saturday, days after former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah was released.

A 24-member delegation of Jammu Kashmir Apni Party led by Altaf Bukhari held detailed discussions with Amit Shah in the presence of top officials of the Home Ministry.

The delegation had met prime minister Narendra Modi on Saturday.

After emerging from the meeting that lasted nearly two hours, Mr Bukhari told reporters that the release of the remaining political leaders was among the topics discussed with the home minister.

""Yes, we did discuss about the detention of remaining political leaders and others, and the home minister said it is a process and we will be releasing them very soon,"" Mr Bukhari said.

,"Elena Pagliarini, a nurse in the northern region of Lombardy.

A worn-out nurse slumps over her keyboard in a widely shared image symbolic of the extreme fatigue that Italian healthcare workers are facing as they battle Europe's worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The picture is of Elena Pagliarini, a nurse in the northern region of Lombardy which has been worst hit by the disease.

Nationwide Italy has more than 1,400 deaths from the virus and 21,000 infections, with a quarter of the country's intensive care beds taken up by those with the illness.

In normal times Lombardy is the economic heart of Italy, equipped with one of the world's best health systems.

But those who staff it -- like Pagliarini -- have been put under enormous strain.

""On one hand I was annoyed to see my photo everywhere, I was ashamed of showing my weakness,"" Pagliarini told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.

""But then I was happy because I got beautiful messages from people who empathised with my story,"" she said.

""I actually don't feel physically tired, I can work for 24 hours straight if it's necessary but I won't hide the fact that right now I'm anxious because I'm fighting an enemy that I don't know,"" she added.

She's just one of many healthcare workers who have expressed their concern at the toll that the outbreak is taking, on facilities and personnel alike.

""It's almost two weeks since I've seen my son or my family because I'm worried about infecting them,"" Daniele Macchini, a hospital doctor in the northern city of Bergamo, (also in Lombardy) wrote in a widely-shared Facebook post.

""I settle for some photos of my son which I look at through my tears, and a few video calls,"" he says.

""Psychologically tired""

Further south in Tuscany, the health system is also starting to feel the pressure.

A nurse in the Tuscan town of Grossetto, Alessia Bonari, posted an image on Instagram of her face bearing marks from a long day of wearing a surgical mask.

""I'm worried because the mask might not be fitting right on my face, I might touch myself accidentally with dirty gloves, the glasses might not totally cover my eyes,"" she wrote in the caption.

She said that the protective gear staff had to wear meant that she couldn't drink or go to the toilet for six hours at a time.

To add to the physical fatigue she said she and all her colleagues had been ""psychologically tired"" for weeks from the workload.

The San Giovanni Bosco hospital in the northern city of Turin this week put a mental health team in place to help its staff counter the stress of the current situation, above all for those working in emergency departments and in intensive care.

""All those who need it can come forward, we're there for everyone,"" Monica Agnesone, one of the 20 psychologists in the team, told the La Stampa newspaper.

She explained that other doctors and hospital staff were suffering from the ""fear of making mistakes, of being infected, of not being able to carry on in these conditions"".

On Thursday Italian media reported that in the northern town of Bergamo alone around 50 doctors had tested positive for the virus.

Further south in a hospital in the Puglia region,local media reported that 76 employees had to go into quarantine after being in contact with patients who tested positive for the virus.

Six of them had to be admitted to hospital, with one needing intensive care.

Agnesone's strategies for coping with the stress will no doubt be increasingly called on in the weeks to come.

She recommends ""carving out moments where you can detach, re-centre yourself, lowering the level of tension by using breathing exercises and focusing on other things.""

Otherwise, she warns, ""stress ends up wearing out your energy"".

With just five days left for the execution of the death sentence in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, the Tihar Jail authorities on Sunday said they have asked the hangman to report three days ahead of the scheduled hanging.

The four convicts in the case are scheduled to hang together at 5.30 am on March 20, according to an order by a Delhi court earlier this month.

The death row convicts are Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

The execution of their death warrants has been deferred thrice so far due to delays caused by the convicts trying to exhaust all legal remedies available to them.

After the fresh death warrant was issued, the Tihar Jail authorities wrote to their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh requesting for the service of hangman Pawan Jallad, a senior jail official said.

""Pawan Jallad, a hangman from Meerut, has been asked to report at Tihar Jail on March 17, three days ahead of the scheduled date of hanging,"" said Sandeep Goel, DG (Prisons).

According to the jail authorities, dummy executions will be conducted again after the arrival of Pawan Jallad.

Health checks-up of the convicts is being done once in a day. They are also being counselled on a regular basis, they said.

Out of the four convicts, Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay have already had their last face-to-face meetings with their respective families. The authorities have written to the family of Akshay about the date of the final meeting before the scheduled date of execution.

Four Congress MLAs in Gujarat have tendered their resignation to Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi ahead of the election to the four Rajya Sabha seats in the state to be held on March 26, prompting the opposition party to shift at least 24 MLAs to Jaipur on Sunday.

While the Congress said not a single ""honest"" MLA has resigned, state BJP president Jitu Vaghani said if the four legislators have indeed quit, the saffron party will win three seats in the Rajya Sabha elections.

Later, the Congress shifted around two dozen of its MLAs to Jaipur fearing poaching.

These moves come as Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi confirmed on Sunday that four Congress MLAs had tendered their resignations on Saturday, all of which had been accepted.

Mr Trivedi said he would disclose the names of the four MLAs during the Assembly session on Monday.

""Four Congress MLAs tendered their resignation to me on Saturday, and I will announce their names in the Assembly tomorrow,"" the speaker told PTI.

Mr Vaghani said he was informed about the development by the speaker.

""Trivedi said that the names of the MLAs who have resigned will be announced in the Assembly on Monday which is in session. MLAs of the Congress have resigned it seems. It means the BJP is winning three seats (in the upcoming Rajya Sabha election),"" Mr Vaghani told reporters.

He said the Congress can withdraw its candidates form the Rajya Sabha election fray till Monday.

BJP Minister in the state government, Kunvarji Bavaliya, claimed that several Congress MLAs who are not happy with their party are in touch with the BJP. He said several such MLAs are likely to join the ruling party in coming days.

""After the announcement of the Rajya Sabha election, several Congress MLAs who have been in touch with us say they are not happy (with their party). Even the MLAs whom the Congress high command could not contact (for shifting them outside Gujarat) are also preparing to join the BJP,"" he said.

In a tweet in Gujarati, Congress leader Paresh Dhanani said not a single ""honest"" Congress MLAs has resigned so far.

Aamir turned 55 on Saturday on March 14

Kareena Kapoor wished Aamir Khan on his birthday with a typically Kareena Kapoor post. Kareena, who made her official debut on Instagram only recently, was up to some mischief when Aamir dozed off on a flight. Aamir and Kareena were spotted greeting each other at Mumbai's private airport on Thursday. The actors flew out of Mumbai for the next schedule of their upcoming movie Laal Singh Chaddha. Kareena's photo of Aamir appears to be from that day, when Aamir decided to take a nap on board. Remember how Aamir Khan never travels without his flight pillow?

Our movie will reach these places when the time is right, but rest assured, just like Irrfan said, 'wait for us'.""

Angrezi Medium opened to encouraging reviews on Friday. In his review for NDTV, film critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote: ""To state the obvious one more time, Irrfan Khan is absolutely fabulous as Champak.

,"Liverpool could have been crowned Premier League champions on Monday for the first time in a generation. Instead the stadium will be silent and the streets empty. Jurgen Klopp's team needed Manchester City to lose to Burnley on Saturday to give them a chance to seal the deal at their local rivals Everton two days later. Regardless of whether it would have happened at Goodison Park or over the coming weeks, their first top-flight title for 30 years was a mere formality. But now fans are wondering when, or even if, they will be crowned champions after the coronavirus laid waste to the global sporting calendar .

The message coming from Liverpool is that there are more important issues than football to talk about, even with the club tantalisingly close to glory.

""I've said before that football always seems the most important of the least important things,"" Klopp said in a statement on Friday.

""Today, football and football matches really aren't important at all.

""If it's a choice between football and the good of the wider society, it's no contest. Really, it isn't.""

Klopp's stance won him the support of World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who thanked him for his ""powerful message"".

Liverpool supporters, desperate to reclaim their position at the pinnacle of the English game, agree with their German manager, saying the pandemic overshadows football.

Supporters' union Spirit of Shankly is focusing on the damaging fallout from the COVID-19 virus.

""In talks with @lfc we asked for assurances that non-playing staff will not lose their pay as a consequence of shifts being cancelled,"" it said in a statement.

""We also need to keep in mind those most vulnerable. Cancelling football games means (foodbanks) will be hit hard.""

Deserving winners

Liverpool have stumbled in recent weeks, knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid and dumped out of the FA Cup by Chelsea.

But they have been peerless in the Premier League, leaving their rivals in their wake to race 25 points clear of defending champions Manchester City.

With Alisson Becker in goal, Virgil van Dijk marshalling the defence and their devastating front three of Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, Klopp's men have been irresistible.

Paul Hayward, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said Liverpool should be crowned champions for the 19th time even if no more games are played.

""If a season ends too soon, its natural winning line is the point it reached before the halt was called: emphatically so, 29 games into a 38-match campaign, which is a respectable distance,"" he wrote.

""'Voiding' the 2019/20 football season would be nonsense,"" he added. ""Handing over the trophy at any point where clubs were forced to give up would feel morally correct.""

Brighton and Hove Albion chief executive Paul Barber said if the season were to be ""frozen"" it would be unjust on Liverpool.

""Everybody in the game appreciates what a fantastic season they've had and what a wonderful team they are,"" he told the BBC.

""But equally it would be unjust for teams to be relegated when there are still eight, nine, ten games to play of the Premier League.""

But West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said if the fixtures could not be completed, the only fair solution would be to declare the season ""null and void"".

Writing in the Sun, Brady, whose club are just two places above the relegation zone, said: ""Who knows who would have gone down or come up if the games have not actually been played in full?

""A huge blow to Liverpool, who might be robbed of their first title in 30 years.""

Nobody knows when football will return but, when it finally does, many in the game hope Liverpool are given the chance to complete their long journey back to the top.",https://sports.ndtv.com/football/coronavirus-liverpool-left-to-wait-and-wonder-2195172,NDTV,Sports,TRUE
,"In arguably the greatest fightback in Test history, India had sealed a historic 171-run win over Australia, becoming only the third side in Test history to win after being forced to follow on, on this day in 2001. A rampaging Australia under Steve Waugh headed to Kolkata for the second Test having thrashed India by 10 wickets in the first match in Mumbai. Between August 1999 and February 2001, Australia won 16 straight Tests, and before this series they beat India 3-0 on home soil in the summer of 1999-2000.

But at Eden Gardens, something surreal happened.

Australia had scored 445 in their first innings on the back of captain Steve Waugh's 110 and 97 from Matthew Hayden, however it was Harbhajan Singh who stole the show, claiming 7/123 including the first hat-trick in India's Test history.

Australia continued their surge despite Harbhajan's heroics, bundling out the home side for 171 in reply, with Glenn McGrath taking 4/18.

Waugh's men looked good to be marching to a 17th straight Test win after enforcing the follow-on. India were reduced to 3/115 and then 4/232 in their second innings - still trailing by 42 with just six wickets in hand when VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid joined hands.

The pair famously shared a 376-run stand for the fifth wicket, and put their team 334 runs in front.

VVS Laxman scored a career-best 281, while Dravid added 180.

,"Four-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles wants more than good wishes from USA Gymnastics. The US federation wished Biles a happy 23rd birthday on social media on Saturday. Biles -- who also owns 19 world titles and is expected to be among the stars of the Tokyo Olympics -- used their tweet as a chance to demand an independent investigation into the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal. ""how about you amaze me and do the right thing ... have an independent investigation,"" Biles snapped on Twitter after the federation's birthday tweet.

""HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most decorated gymnast of all time, @simonebiles!"" USA Gymnastics wrote, posting a video of Biles in action in a floor exercise. ""We know you will only continue to amaze us and make history!""

how about you amaze me and do the right thing... have an independent investigation https://t.co/58Gc9QUk76 — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) March 14, 2020

Former national gymnastics team doctor Nassar was jailed for life for abusing more than 250 athletes, including stars of the United States' 2012 and 2016 gold medal-winning Olympic teams.

A US Senate investigation found that ""multiple institutions"" failed to adequately respond to credible allegations against Nassar, but Biles has said that USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee still owe his victims, including herself, more answers and a framework to ensure such abuses won't occur again.

""Wish they BOTH wanted an independent investigation as much as the survivors & I do,"" she tweeted earlier this month.

As Biles and other elite gymnasts ramp up their preparations for Tokyo, USA Gymnastics in January offered a $215 million (194 million euros) settlement to victims of Nassar to settle legal claims -- a plan a lawyer for more than 200 women called ""unconscionable.""

Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who is now retired, called the settlement offer ""offensive"" and accused the federation of attempting to prevent release of details which would show how Nassar was able to abuse athletes for years.

Attorney John Manley, who represents more than 180 clients with active claims against USA Gymnastics, said the settlement offer releases too many people from further claims, including the USOPC, former USA Gymnastics chief Steve Penny and former national team directors Bela and Marta Karolyi.",https://sports.ndtv.com/gymnastics/how-about-you-amaze-me-simone-biles-dig-at-usa-gymnastics-in-birthday-tweet-2195147,NDTV,Sports,TRUE

The Pistons, without identifying Wood, issued a statement on Saturday saying that one of their players had tested positive. Woods' agent Adam Pensack told the Detroit News on Saturday that his client is the one, adding ""he feels 100 percent fine."" ""A player on the Detroit Pistons, who is under the care of team medical staff and in self-isolation since Wednesday night, was tested for COVID-19,"" the Pistons said in a statement.

,"David Beckham's six-year wait to watch his Major League Soccer club make its home debut, which was to have ended Saturday, has been extended by the league's coronavirus shutdown . But that didn't stop him and his family from visiting Inter Miami's empty stadium on Saturday. Beckham's club was to have hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy, the MLS club where the former England and Manchester United star played from 2007 through 2012, in its first match at its temporary home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Instead, the entire league has joined all major North American sports leagues and shut down its season for 30 days due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

That left Inter Miami owner and president David Beckham and his wife, Victoria, to take their four children to the empty venue and post a video on Instagram.

""Special day showing the family what we've built,"" Beckham posted as the camera made a 360-degree tour of empty Inter Miami Stadium while music of Spice Girls -- his wife's former group -- blared through the loudspeakers.

Beckham also posted messages Friday on Instagram with photos taken from the field in the empty 20,000-seat stadium.

""It's times like these when we are reminded of the things that are truly important in life,"" Beckham posted on Instagram. ""Our health. Our loved ones and looking after those that need support in our communities.

""In these moments, sports take a back seat. We must all listen to expert advice and do the right thing. Stay safe and look out for yourselves and your families.""

Inter Miami still seeks a first-ever MLS triumph, having lost 1-0 at Los Angeles FC on March 1 and 2-1 at DC United six days later.

Those matches culminated a wild six-year effort filled with setbacks and frustrations.

Beckham, 44, came to the United States in 2007, the global icon leaving Real Madrid for a deal with the Galaxy that included the option to buy an MLS expansion club at a discounted price.

Over six seasons with the Galaxy, Beckham helped raise the sport's US profile and was a major contributor to the club's 2011 and 2012 MLS Cup titles.

After retiring in 2013, Beckham decided to exercise his option for an MLS expansion team in 2014 and sought to build a soccer-specific stadium in Miami.

Struggles with city leaders and civic groups followed, location after location foiled by one problem after another, and MLS hesitated to award a franchise to a group without a stadium plan set in place.

Beckham joined with Miami-based construction magnates Jorge and Jose Mas in 2017 and that represented a turning point in his quest.

In 2018, city officials approved construction of the Miami Freedom Park complex near Miami International Airport, its centrepiece being a new 25,000-seat stadium that is expected to be ready for Inter Miami to move into in 2022.

""Everything we've tried to do to get this franchise up and running was a challenge,"" Beckham said last month.

""There wasn't one (easy) thing -- from finding the land, thinking what kind of stadium we want, what kind of players we want, what kind of manager we want, even down to what tiles we had in the showers -- everything was a challenge.

,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday resisted pressure for changes to the Tokyo Olympics schedule even as sporting events worldwide fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic. Abe pledged Japan would host the Games as planned in July and said he had no immediate intention to declare a state of emergency over the virus outbreak, which has now seen more than 140,000 people infected across the globe and over 5,400 killed.

His comments come two days after US President Donald Trump suggested the Japanese capital postpone the Games for a year as the spread of the virus wreaks havoc on the sporting calendar.

""We will respond by closely coordinating with officials concerned, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee). There is no change in this,"" Abe told a news conference.

""We want to hold the Olympics as planned without any trouble by overcoming the spread of infections,"" he said.

Organisers, Japanese government officials and the IOC have insisted preparations are on track and there will be no postponement or cancellation.

England's football Premier League, America's NBA basketball season and the Augusta Masters golf major are just some of the competitions suspended because of the pandemic.

On Friday, Abe and Trump spoke on the phone about the outbreak and Olympics after Trump proposed a delay.

""We agreed that Japan and the US will cooperate and closely coordinate for success in the Olympics,"" Abe said, adding they had not discussed any postponement.

The Japanese parliament on Friday approved legislation that gives Abe the power to declare a state of emergency to combat COVID-19 but Abe insisted such a declaration was not yet necessary.

The coronavirus has infected more than 700 people across Japan and been linked to 21 deaths. Separately, 700 people on board a cruise ship that docked near Tokyo last month were also infected.

A state of emergency would allow local governments to require that people stay indoors, schools close and public facilities limit use.

Land and buildings could be requisitioned for makeshift hospitals.

,"A rampaging ATK claimed an unprecedented third Indian Super League (ISL) title triumph with a 3-1 victory over arch-rival Chennaiyin FC in a summit showdown that was played behind closed doors in Margao on Saturday. Javier Hernandez (10th) and Edu Garcia (48th) put ATK in the driving seat but Nerijus Valskis (69th) reduced their advantage to set up a tense end to the contest. Hernandez scored another in injury time (90+4th) to confirm a record third title. The final was held without spectators owing to the COVID-19 pandemic .

The match was off to a blistering start as Andre Schembri made a good run to the byline on the right in the first minute and found Rafael Crivellaro in the centre with a good cross, but the Brazilian mishit his effort. Schembri threatened again minutes later, this time with a pass to Valskis whose shot hit the crossbar.

ATK drew first blood with their first major sight of goal in the 10th minute.

John Johnson's cross-field ball found Roy Krishna on the left flank who delivered a good cross towards the edge of the box. Javier Hernandez, who was left unmarked, smashed a half-volley into the ground and beat goalkeeper Vishal Kaith to give ATK the lead.

The contest remained open but Chennaiyin suffered an injury setback midway through the first half. Midfielder Germanpreet Singh had to be replaced and Edwin Vanspaul took his place.

ATK went close to doubling their lead in the 23rd minute out of utter chaos inside the box which produced three back-to-back attempts.

Krishna cut in from the right and unleashed a powerful strike which was saved by Kaith. Javier Hernandez then had the ball at his feet twice, but on both occasions, his shot was blocked. Chennaiyin put pressure on the ATK defence and carved out a golden chance from a free-kick after the 30-minute-mark.

Schembri met Crivellaro's delivery into the box but Arindam Bhattacharya pulled off an excellent save to keep ATK's lead intact.

The scoreline remained 1-0 in favour of ATK at the break, but the Kolkata side had a concern of their own as Krishna had to be replaced by Mandi Sosa due to an injury.



ATK scored the all-important second goal and doubled their advantage two minutes into the second half.

Williams picked up the ball in midfield and fed Edu Garcia into the box. The Spanish midfielder beat Kaith with a neat finish from an acute angle to make it 2-0.

The Chennaiyin attack struggled to create clear-cut chances and their opponents restricted them to long-range efforts.

Lallianzuala Chhangte attempted a piledriver from outside the box before the hour mark but sent the ball wide.

Chennaiyin finally found a way past the ATK defence in the 69th minute.

Laldinliana Renthlei played a neat one-two with Anirudh Thapa on the right before sending a cross into the centre of the box.

Pritam Kotal's headed clearance fell to Jerry Lalrinzuala who passed the ball to Valskis in the centre.

The Lithuanian striker found the net with a powerful strike to score his 15th goal of the season and give Chennaiyin a lifeline.

Chennaiyin built one attack after another as the game neared full-time but the balls into the box were well dealt by ATK.

ATK got their third goal of the night and struck the final blow in the last minute of injury time.

,"With the GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, increasing the GST on mobile phones from 12 percent to 18 percent on Saturday, industry experts feel it would hit the industry and the consumers hard.

Brands are in no position to absorb this impact. ""They will, most certainly, decide to pass it on to the consumer, at least in case of high-selling models,"" said Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India.

The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) stressed that the move would stymie consumption.

""The 6 percent GST increase will be detrimental to the vision of 'digital India'. Consumption will be stymied and our domestic consumption target of $80 billion (Rs. 6,00,000 crores) by 2025 will not be achieved. We will fall short by at least Rs. 2,00,000 crores,"" said Pankaj Mohindroo, ICEA Chairman.

In a letter to the Finance Minister on March 12, the ICEA had said the mobile handsets sector was in deep stress because of the supply chain disruption due to coronavirus outbreak. It was the most inappropriate time to consider GST hike on mobile phones, the industry body said.

It also said the GST hike on mobile phone might adversely affect localisation of manufacturing as well as popularisation of the country's digital payments objectives.

According to ICEA, 31-32 crore Indians who buy phones in the country will be impacted by the move.

Terming the move counter-intuitive and detrimental to the 'digital India' vision, the IDC India Research Director said, ""This is a textbook case of missing the wood for the trees. This will stunt any hope of growth in the near-term, which anyway looks challenging now due to coronavirus issue at both supply and demand ends,"" Singh told IANS.

,"While it makes perfect sense for IT employees to work from remote locations via video conferencing and collaboration tools seamlessly - especially in the case of tech giants like Google or Microsoft -- workers from the non-IT companies and small and medium enterprises (SMBs) are the worst-hit in India as most of them have little or no clue about how these messaging and collaboration tools work amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Small companies -- from corporate to education verticals -- are scrambling to get their act together as new coronavirus threat has reached their premises, prompting them to send employees home who have age-old laptops, poor network and connectivity with no UPS backups and little knowledge about how to handle group chat and collaboration software like Zoom, Google Hangouts Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Flock etc.

Instead of halting operations, however, businesses can choose to shift towards remote working methods with teaching non-IT staff on how to use the latest digital software to connect and work, say industry experts.

The training will take some time and may hamper productivity in the short run but is a win-win situation for the non-tech companies in the long run, in case any such global emergency arises in the future.

According to a latest report by Gartner, 54 percent of HR leaders have cited that poor technology and/or infrastructure for remote working is the biggest barrier to effective remote working.

Sandy Shen, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, says that with COVID-19 disrupting the business landscape, CIOs should relook at the digital fulfilment of market demand.

""The value of digital channels, products and operations is immediately obvious to companies everywhere right now. This is a wake-up call for organisations that have placed too much focus on daily operational needs at the expense of investing in digital business and long-term resilience,"" warned Shen.

Businesses that can shift technology capacity and investments to digital platforms will mitigate the impact of the outbreak and keep their companies running smoothly now, and over the long term.

""Videoconferencing, messaging, collaboration tools and document sharing are just a few examples of technologies that facilitate remote work. Additional bandwidth and network capacity may also be needed, given the increasing number of users and volume of communications,"" informed Shen.

The IT industry's apex body Nasscom has asked the government to relax norms for a month to allow work-from-home for technology and back-office employees as a measure to deal with the spread of COVID-19 in India.

It can also connect with various tools like Skype, Cisco WebEx, Zoom, Google Hangouts and GoToMeeting,"" Ahmad told IANS.

""Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high,"" Musk said.

A cargo plane loaded with 500,000 masks and other medical supplies such as test kits landed at Liege Airport. The consignment will be sent to Italy, a joint statement by the Alibaba and Jack Ma foundations, the Belgian region of Wallonia and Liege Airport said.

Further flights are due arrive in coming days to the airport, which is set to become Alibaba's main European hub for e-commerce shipments.

First one should be the Pixel 4a series, successor to the Pixel 3a series lunched last year, and the Pixel 5 series, which is expected to launch later in October. Information regarding both the phones has surfaced online, and the Pixel 4a is reported to support UFS 2.1 storage for faster app loading and files transfer. The Pixel 5, on the other hand, is reported to not offer flagship-level specifications this time around, and it may be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC.

Starting with the Pixel 4a, XDA Developers report that the upcoming device will support UFS 2.1 storage, instead of the eMMC flash storage found on the predecessor Pixel 3a. YouTuber Julio Lusson shared the bootloader screen of the Pixel 4a that showed a line that read “Ufs: 64GB SKHynix.” With this, the publication determined that the Google Pixel 4a pre-production unit with Lusson has the 64GB UFS 2.1 H9HQ53AECMMDAR-KEM from SK Hynix integrated. This is a strong indication that Google is making the shift to UFS storage with Pixel 4a, bringing better power management, better read and write speeds, and faster app loading and installation. However, Google may or may not integrate it in the final unit, so it's best to take things lightly for now.

Lusson also shared access to a pre-release version of the Google Camera app from the Pixel 4a pre-production unit with 9to5Google, and the teardown of the app reveals that the Pixel 4a may include a telephoto lens. The Pixel 4a is referred to as “photo_pixel_2020_midrange_config” inside the app, and there's code that reads SABRE_UNZOOMED_TELEPHOTO — hinting at a telephoto lens. Pixel 5, expected to release later in the year, is referred to as “photo_pixel_2020_config” inside the Google Camera app. The teardown reveals that the Pixel 5 may have two codenames – Bramble and Redfin.

If we are to backtrack a few months, a report had suggested that Google's Bramble and Redfin phones may be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC. At that time, these phones were speculated to be the Pixel 4a, but this new teardown suggests that they belong to the Pixel 5. All of this means, the Google's Pixel 5 phone may break the tradition and not be powered by Qualcomm's flagship chipset, but instead be powered by the Snapdragon 765G SoC, a popular second-best option with built-in 5G support. Of course, this is very early speculation, and Google still has plenty of time to fiddle around before making final calls. Pixel 5 is reported to feature reverse wireless charging, and offer triple rear cameras.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/pixel-5-4a-ufs-2-1-storage-snapdragon-765g-soc-code-teardown-2194942,NDTV,Tech,TRUE

But none of that is available on Hotstar — or Disney+ Hotstar, depending on how it's feeling — even a day later, despite all the Disney+ originals being released in India earlier this week on Wednesday.

That signals that Hotstar has paused the weekly rollout of new Disney+ content in India. Gadgets 360 has reached out to Hotstar for confirmation and comment on when the moratorium is expected to be lifted. After abruptly dropping everything on Wednesday, it's unclear why Hotstar has now decided to not push out new content, especially in the case of the seven aforementioned series, which are already available on Hotstar. The last new episode for each series is from the Friday before. It's a curious choice, to say the least, though it does fit the pattern set by Hotstar — one of utter confusion.

Hotstar has completely bungled the launch of Disney+ in India. A bit of catch-up for those who need it. Early Wednesday, Hotstar pushed out all Disney+ originals as it finished rebranding its apps to “Disney+ Hotstar”. But it then changed its mind later that day. The content was hidden from search, the rebranding largely disappeared — depending on when and where you access it, the app icon might read “Hotstar” or “Disney+ Hotstar” — though the new blue colour theme stayed. Hotstar said the new app was in beta test until the full launch on March 29, but that seemed like a cover-up for its faux pas.

Some of those concerns were expected to be addressed at a launch event in Mumbai on Friday, which was cancelled at the last minute, citing the ongoing coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. And after the BCCI's decision on Friday to postpone the start of the 2020 Indian Premier League season until mid-April in the wake of growing concerns around the pandemic, Disney+'s official arrival in India could get delayed, given its desire to time Disney+'s India launch with the start of IPL. Hotstar has not responded to Gadgets 360's multiple requests for comment on a possible launch delay.

Owing to all that, it's easily possible that Hotstar subscribers in India might not see any new Disney+ content until mid-April. After a pleasant Wednesday surprise, Hotstar has switched back to regular programming: letting its users down.",https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/news/hotstar-disney-plus-india-content-paused-launch-no-weekly-shows-movies-2194889,NDTV,Tech,TRUE

On April 13, Facebook will remove the app from both the Android and iOS app stores.

Facebook acquired MSQRD in 2016 and the AR app played a key role in enhancing the company's portfolio of AR image and video tools like 'Spark AR' that lets users create custom face filters for Facebook and Instagram.

""MSQRD was fundamental to building early momentum for AR and providing insights to build the platform Facebook has today,"" the company said in a statement late Friday.

Today, Instagram and Snapchat offer several in-built face-swapping tools.

Fuelled by Snapchat Lenses and Facebook Stories, AR is gaining fast traction.

Facebook is currently building its own operating system (OS) from scratch that will power its hardware: mainly AR and virtual reality (VR) headsets like Oculus and video calling devices like Portal that currently runs Google's Android OS.

Microsoft on Friday announced that co-founder Bill Gates has left its board of directors to devote more time to philanthropy.

The 64-year-old stopped being involved in day-to-day operations at the firm more than a decade ago, turning his attention to the foundation he launched with his wife, Melinda.

Gates served as chairman of Microsoft's board of directors until early in 2014 and has now stepped away entirely, according to the Redmond-based technology giant.

""It's been a tremendous honor and privilege to have worked with and learned from Bill over the years,"" Microsoft chief executive and company veteran Satya Nadella said in a release.

""Bill founded our company with a belief in the democratizing force of software and a passion to solve society's most pressing challenges; and Microsoft and the world are better for it.""

Nadella said Microsoft would continue to benefit from Gates' ""technical passion and advice"" in his continuing role as a technical advisor.

""I am grateful for Bill's friendship and look forward to continuing to work alongside him,"" Nadella said.

Computing and compassion -

Gates left his CEO position in 2000, handing the company reins to Steve Ballmer to devote more time to his charitable foundation.

He gave up the role of chairman at the same time Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO in 2014.

Regularly listed among the world's richest people, William H. Gates was a geeky-looking young man when he and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft in 1975.

Gates grew up in Seattle with two sisters. His father William was an attorney and his late mother Mary was a schoolteacher and chairwoman of United Way International.

He began programming computers as a 13-year-old student, and fell in love with the machines.

Among the tales told about Gates is that while working on school computers, he tinkered with programming to put himself in classes made up mostly of girls.

With his parents' blessing, Gates dropped out of Harvard to start ""Micro-soft"" with his late childhood friend Allen.

A key move was to focus on licensing software to computer makers in numerous ""partnerships"" that resulted in affordable machines being available to the masses.

As the personal computer market grew, Microsoft became the world's top software company. Its virtual monopoly led to a much-publicized antitrust trial, in which the company managed to avert a break-up but had to endure years of government monitoring.

Gates went on to turn his attention from software to fighting disease and other humanitarian challenges with his wife, under the auspices of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

""This move is not surprising to the Street as Gates has continued to focus more on his myriad of philanthropies across the globe over the past decade,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors.

""I look forward to our developers getting their hands on the new code and interacting in entirely new ways with the Apple engineers building the technologies and frameworks that will shape the future across all Apple platforms,"" Federighi added.

Apple also announced it will commit $1 million to local San Jose organisations to offset associated revenue loss as a result of WWDC 2020's new online format.

Developers have earned over $155 billion since the App Store launched in 2008.

With an active installed base of more than 1.5 billion Apple devices, WWDC 2020 will allow developers to learn about the new technologies and frameworks they rely on as they create new app experiences in areas including augmented reality, machine learning, health and fitness, home automation and more.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Dr. Fauci cautioned, “Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.”

While the Trump administration has banned international travelers coming from high-risk countries and regions, such as China, Iran, and much of Europe, Dr. Fauci said domestic travel restrictions hadn’t been seriously discussed.

“I don’t see that right now or in the immediate future,” he said on “This Week.” “But remember, we are very open-minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public.”

The administration’s evaluation of the virus’s impact comes as many companies, universities and school districts are already announcing voluntary closings and suspension of normal operations. Last week, over a dozen states began to shutter public schools, and colleges and universities worldwide announced class suspensions and plans to move to online instruction.

In an interview with Brianna Keilar on CNN, Dr. Fauci said that progress was being made with companies like Walmart and CVS to improve diagnostic and testing capabilities. But he cautioned that disruptions to daily life were likely to continue.

“It would be better to agree a delay now,” Mr. Henig said. “If June is the peak of the virus and it is also the point where we are going to say, ‘no further extension,’ then that starts to look like a lack of forward planning.”

Analysts noted that coronavirus could give Mr. Johnson political cover to ask for an extension, if that was what he wanted to do anyway. Last fall, the prime minister cited a law passed by Parliament as giving him no choice but to ask for the withdrawal deadline to be moved from October to January.

For Mr. Johnson, however, such a move poses a dilemma. Under the terms of its agreement, Britain would be required to pay billions of pounds to the European Union if it continued to have access to the single market and customs union beyond the transition period that ends in December.

Cases in the U.S. have climbed to almost 2,000, even with sparse testing, and the death toll has risen to 41.

There are signs that we are still much closer to the beginning of the outbreak than the end. Our colleague Sheri Fink reported today that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have projected that in a worst-case situation, 160 million to 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected.

The projections suggest that 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds, in an outbreak that could last months or even over a year.

Dr. Redfield advocated for widespread testing and tracking as the best way to prevent the infection’s spread, while others argued it was a way for the military to flush out or otherwise discriminate against gay members. Later, he was the subject of a military investigation after colleagues suspected that he overstated the therapeutic effects of an experimental AIDS vaccine; the investigation led to a correction in some published data, but no evidence of misconduct was found.

He retired from the Army in 1996 to co-found the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where the goal is to discover and distribute treatments for chronic viral and immune disorders, especially H.I.V. When Dr. Redfield left the institute, his co-founder, Dr. Robert C. Gallo, called him a major force in establishing programs to confront the H.I.V. and hepatitis C epidemics in Baltimore and around the state.

He is credited with helping the institute increase its patient base to 6,000 in Baltimore and Washington, and to more than 1.3 million in Africa and the Caribbean, where he also helped with the medical response in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. He formed close relationships with patients, and kept photos of some who died of AIDS in his early days at Walter Reed in his office for years.

In his first two years leading the C.D.C., Dr. Redfield helped persuade Mr. Trump to take on the ambitious goal of ending transmission of H.I.V. in the country by 2030, through expanded efforts to prevent infections and treat those with the virus. And he has been a vocal champion of efforts to address opioid addiction and overdose, even sharing with the nation that one of his own sons had nearly died of an overdose and that the family struggled to find him treatment.

Dr. Redfield’s initial compensation at the C.D.C. caused an embarrassing controversy shortly after he took office. After earning about $650,000 a year at the University of Maryland, he was hired at an annual salary of $375,000, substantially higher than his predecessors and his boss, the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II.

The exceptional pay was granted under a federal provision that the Department of Health and Human Services can use to pay an official more than the approved government rate if the person provides a specific scientific need that otherwise cannot be filled. The department said this was a rare chance to hire a leading virologist.

,"We asked the experts how to wash our hands. After they taught us the proper technique (above), we had a few more questions:

Will touching the wet faucet really ruin everything?

Yes.

The faucet may have the same germs you started with! Use a tissue or paper towel to turn it off once your hands are clean. You don’t want to begin again, do you?

How hard do I have to scrub?

Most people don’t rub vigorously enough, said Barbara Smith, a nurse epidemiologist and infection prevention specialist at Mount Sinai Health Systems in New York.

When you wash your hands, you are using soap and water to physically dislodge germs from your skin and then rinse them away.

Do I really have to dry my hands all the way?

Most people don’t dry thoroughly enough. Germs love moisture. And don’t be afraid to use a little force here too: You are physically removing whatever germs remain.

Do I have to use paper towels?

No. Cloth towels are fine for personal use, but should be washed every few days — more if multiple people use the same towel. A sick person should use a separate towel. Use paper towels for guests!

What about an air dryer?

In terms of hygiene, paper towels are best. Hand dryers are OK, so long as you dry your hands thoroughly. There is inconclusive research that suggests a higher germ concentration around some hand dryers, but using a hand dryer is definitely better than wiping your hands on your pants.

What’s the best way to know you’ve washed for 20 seconds?

One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand…

Does it matter what kind of soap I use?

Liquid soap is best. Bar soap is fine too, just don’t let it sit around in a gloppy dish. Remember: germs love moisture.

When should I be washing my hands?

Before you leave the house (to protect others from your germs).

And when you arrive at your destination (to wash off germs you’ve picked up from door knobs, elevator buttons, public transportation, etc.)

Before and after you eat or prepare food.

Before and after you clean your home.

After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.

After you use the bathroom or change a diaper.

After you feed or touch a pet.

What about lotion for dry hands?

Yes, but use your own personal supply (most lotion does not contain antibacterial agents, so it should not be shared). And don’t forget to keep the bottle and dispenser clean!

Can I still paint my nails?

Yes, but it’s best to keep your nails short and your manicure fresh. Germs can live in cracked and chipped polish.

What’s the technique with hand sanitizer?

Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, and scrub your hands the same way you would with soap and water. Be sure to use enough liquid so you can reach every surface of your hands.

Note: If you’ve seen the recipe circulating on social media for homemade sanitizer using aloe vera gel and rubbing alcohol, we tried it and it didn’t work. You’ll just wind up with a batch of diluted alcohol.

Is hand-washing really that important?

Keeping them as clean as possible is really helpful,” said Dr. Adit Ginde, professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “It would dramatically reduce transmission if people did it well.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/how-to-wash-your-hands-coronavirus.html,NY Times,World,TRUE

From a single household, a large map can be constructed. First, the connections between mom, dad, son and daughter. Added next are dad’s connections at the shop, mom’s at an office, and the children’s at their respective schools.

Balaraba was 19 when she was kidnapped from her home in northeastern Nigeria by Boko Haram militants. With murderous blows from their machetes, they made her a widow and a captive.

Boko Haram has abducted an unknown number of women and girls like Balaraba to be brutalized, raped and forced into service by their captors. You may remember the Chibok girls, more than 250 students kidnapped nearly six years ago from a school in the same region of Nigeria where Balaraba lives. Their abduction opened the world’s eyes to Boko Haram’s campaign of terror.

The Nigerian army has had mixed results fighting Boko Haram, which is often better equipped than the military. Civilian volunteers have taken up arms to help protect their homes and try to rescue the thousands of Nigeria’s daughters, sisters and mothers who are still missing. Often, these captives are forced to marry fighters or turned into suicide bombers. Balaraba was given explosives to detonate at a mosque, a market in Maiduguri and other targets, but she found ways to get out of her missions before she was eventually rescued.

The C.I.A.’s renewed focus on Mr. Tice, who was working as a journalist when he was captured in 2012, reflects a broader push by the Trump administration to focus more intently on Americans being held hostage abroad.

Then gang members murdered her son-in-law, and she and her daughter testified against them. In the past, her story might have been grounds for asylum in the United States — or at least an asylum hearing — but not anymore. That’s because the Trump administration is upending the U.S. asylum system. “So that’s a very big thing. It’s a very important signature.” And one way they’re doing it is through a deal with Guatemala, called the Asylum Cooperation Agreement, or ACA. “This landmark agreement will put the coyotes and the smugglers out of business, and stop asylum fraud and abuses.” What this means in practice is that hundreds of asylum seekers from Honduras and El Salvador have been deported, and told to seek refuge in Guatemala instead. But Guatemala is plagued by many of the same problems that people are fleeing in the first place: violence, poverty and corruption. So I came to see what asylum in Guatemala looks like. Once deported under the ACA, asylum seekers arrive at this shelter. Everyone I speak with is confused. They’d made the long journey north only to end up back nearly where they started. The woman I met earlier, the one threatened by MS-13, is also staying at the shelter. She and her daughter are applying for asylum here, but a friend warns her that the gang is tracking them. She’s one of the very few people to pursue an asylum claim here. In fact, only about 16 of more than 900 people have done so. So why does this deal exist? Even Guatemala’s newly elected president, Alejandro Giammattei, acknowledges the deal is political. And he’s right. They don’t want to stay here. It’s too close to home, and asylum here offers little protection or support. The U.S. had pledged to pump $47 million into Guatemala’s asylum system, but it’s unclear how much of that money has been received or how it’s been spent. Nevertheless, more of these deals are in the pipeline. “We entered into historic cooperation agreements with …” Soon, the Trump administration plans to implement asylum deals with Honduras and El Salvador. Those countries are even less prepared. Two days later, I meet up again with the woman who’s running from MS-13. Her situation has already gotten worse. She and her daughter can’t stay at the shelter anymore. They’ve been there a month, and yet their asylum claims could take a few months to a year to process.

Madrid is normally one of Europe’s most bustling cities, with people filling its public parks and squares, or meeting for drinks and tapas in its thousands of bars and cafes.

Yet on Saturday, Madrid resembled a ghost city, as its 3.5 million residents, who normally spend much of their social life on the streets, started to follow the advice of the authorities to stay at home.

The train stations and main avenues were almost deserted, while some police cars patrolled the city center. Only stores providing basic services — such as supermarkets and gas stations — were allowed to stay open. People who ventured outside often headed to supermarkets to buy essential supplies.

Museums and other public venues closed earlier this week. The gates of Madrid’s central park, the Retiro, were shut by the police on Saturday afternoon.

On the arcaded Plaza Mayor, one of the main public spaces in the heart of the city, some tourists took a last walk as they hoped to catch a flight later in the day.

['Rory Smith'],"Soccer’s response to coronavirus has proved two things. One is quite how fractured the game’s structure has become, how unable it is to speak with one voice, even on an issue as pressing as its role in mitigating a public health emergency. Each authority has been unable to look beyond its own responsibility, to imagine itself as part of a greater whole.

That has always been the case, of course; it is what lies at the heart of the ongoing conversations about the global calendar, the endless struggle to fold the ambitions and the greed of Europe’s aristocratic clubs into some broader structure.

But it has been laid bare in the last few weeks just how rife the game is with self-interest, how little care there is for the sport as a whole, and how vulnerable that makes everything.

The crisis has revealed how reluctant organizing bodies are to inconvenience themselves and how navel-gazing club officials can be, wondering whether their players will be overloaded by makeup games when there is a possibility the season itself might have to be canceled.

The second is not unrelated. Nobody doubts that soccer — as a sport — is by its very nature a nonessential activity. It does not matter, not like guaranteeing that children have access to education or that an economy can continue functioning or that people have enough to eat. It is in the front rank of things that should be considered optional, easily sacrificed for the greater good.

But that is not how soccer the business sees it. Action would certainly have been taken sooner if there were not quite so much money riding on the sport. Every available solution would seem much more feasible if there were not quite so many financial — and legal — factors to be considered.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/sports/soccer/soccer-coronavirus-premier-league.html,NY Times,Europe,TRUE
"['Mark Landler', 'Stephen Castle']","Though video conferences can substitute for many face-to-face meetings, the Brexit talks are complex, ranging over an array of issues, from fisheries to finance, and involving a British negotiating team of 100 officials. Given the grim arithmetic of the pandemic, several of those negotiators are likely to fall ill.

“It would be better to agree a delay now,” Mr. Henig said. “If June is the peak of the virus and it is also the point where we are going to say, ‘no further extension,’ then that starts to look like a lack of forward planning.”

Analysts noted that coronavirus could give Mr. Johnson political cover to ask for an extension, if that was what he wanted to do anyway. Last fall, the prime minister cited a law passed by Parliament as giving him no choice but to ask for the withdrawal deadline to be moved from October to January.

For Mr. Johnson, however, such a move poses a dilemma. Under the terms of its agreement, Britain would be required to pay billions of pounds to the European Union if it continued to have access to the single market and customs union beyond the transition period that ends in December.

That would be an acute embarrassment for Mr. Johnson, damaging him particularly with the hard-line Brexit wing of his Conservative Party. Pro-Brexit forces have already begun campaigning against a delay — suggesting, in a strategy that echoes some defenders of President Trump in the United States, that these calls were part of an effort to exaggerate and politicize the virus for partisan ends.

“The same people who wanted to stop Brexit now want to extend the Transition Period, ostensibly over Coronavirus,” said the Bruges Group, a Euroskeptic research institute, on Twitter. “We know the pattern: Any excuse is found, one delay turns into another and Britain ends up in political purgatory.

It has also said that the measures it has taken, like asking people with persistent coughs and high temperatures to stay home for a week, will reduce the spread of the virus considerably.

Arab citizens make up a fifth of Israel’s population and for the first time have come close to proportional representation in Parliament. The predominantly Arab Joint List won nearly 582,000 votes and a record 15 parliamentary seats, enough to be decisive in an election in which neither Mr. Netanyahu’s bloc nor Mr. Gantz’s won a majority.

But Mr. Netanyahu declared those votes “not part of the equation.” The Joint List, he said, “attacks our soldiers and opposes the State of Israel.”

Critics said his dismissal of the Arab vote was not only self-serving — the 15 seats combined with Mr. Gantz’s coalition would boot Mr. Netanyahu from office — but also racist and antidemocratic.

“Dismissing more than half a million citizens by rendering the 15 members of the Joint List illegitimate, coupled with incitement against anyone who engages with them, crosses a red line,” Yuval Diskin, a former head of the internal security agency, wrote Wednesday in Yediot Ahronot.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/middleeast/israel-arabs-vote.html,NY Times,Middle-East,TRUE

Yet only a fraction of people ended up getting tested, and even before any of the results came back, business quickly returned to normal — with tourists unleashed en masse to visit the town’s fabled temples.

The prospect of more oil on the market could accelerate the collapse in prices, which have fallen about a third this year.

Both Russia and Saudi Arabia appear to be acting for short-term advantage with risky strategies. Russia has gained significant political clout in the Middle East by aligning with OPEC. Helping to support oil prices in concert with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states has helped the government of President Nicolás Maduro survive in Venezuela. Now, the Russians have chosen to go it alone, refusing to coordinate with OPEC in proposed production cuts perhaps in the hope of undercutting American oil producers.

For Saudi Arabia, cooperation with Russia had reinforced OPEC’s clout at a time it is being threatened by the recent surge in American oil production that has turned the United States into a major crude exporter for the first time in decades.

In recent weeks, the government has been consulting with the International Monetary Fund, signaling that it would seek a bailout if its divided political factions can reach a consensus. But any international aid package is likely to come at the price of austerity measures that will be difficult for an already frustrated Lebanese public to accept, and promises of reform that previous governments have repeatedly made and broken.

And while the report found that total state spending on public health increased 2 percent in the 2018 fiscal year, 17 states and the District of Columbia cut public health funding that year, while 21 percent of local health departments reported reductions in budgets for the 2017 fiscal year.

The federal Public Health Emergency Preparedness program, which helps state and local health departments prepare for and respond to emergencies, including outbreaks of infectious diseases, has also seen funding reductions, falling from $940 million in the 2002 fiscal year to $617 million in the 2019 fiscal year, according to statistics compiled by the Trust for America’s Health.

Some of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus run the gamut in terms of public health emergency preparedness, according to rankings by Trust for America’s Health, with Washington State in a top category of preparedness, California in the middle, and New York in the bottom.

It occurred to me that a lot of my previous work was invested in the management of feeling, and if the version of me I was writing about was confused or full of rage, I would find some way to process that emotion into something more palatable. This book on a certain level was about the tension between a performative emotion and raw feeling. I ended up giving myself permission to put more chaos on the page than I ever had before. A lot of queer people — a lot of people — are told to buck up, swallow your feelings, behave. And I think a lot about the cost of that. Suppressing hurt and rage — those are important social tools, and yet if we become champions at those social tools, all of that can come back and hurt us and have a cost on how we love, how we connect with our friends and partners.

In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?

At a certain point, the energy stopped and whatever I was doing did not really feel authentic to the experience. I ended up putting it aside for some months. I came back to it and pulled it apart a bit and wrote something more immediate. I flipped it into the present tense and introduced some fragmentary sections that might function on the page as prose poems. It felt like the book I ended up writing could be a container for irreverence and dread and joy and rage.

I can’t write any memoir without envisioning that “I” as a constructed thing. My education was as a fiction writer, and I started writing fiction because I wanted to escape myself, I wanted to be someone else. I started writing nonfiction when it became clear to me that that voice is also a made thing, and in some way it has some correlation to the narrator in fiction. The “I” of one book should be a different “I” than in another book.

Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?

I first heard Joni Mitchell’s music when I was 10 years old, and I thought: Who’s that? What’s that? It wasn’t necessarily the sound of her voice — which felt distinctive — but I knew there was something unique about how her songs moved. My sense, even though I didn’t have the musical tools to articulate it, was that she was making up music on her own terms. I continue to love her work. It’s the meticulousness of it, the loyalty to idiosyncrasy, the respect for emotional complexity, the refusal to repeat one’s own rules or habits. She’s willing to be an amateur with each album and try to do something new. She’s probably changed my life like no other artist has, and I think of her all the time. There are nods to her in all of my books — not just in section titles, but in patches of images collaged throughout that only the most rabid fan could pick up.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/books/later-memoir-paul-lisicky-interview.html,NY Times,US,TRUE
"['Matt Stevens', 'Maggie Astor']","Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate one on one for the first time on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders, who is staying in the Democratic primary race despite a series of defeats, has already telegraphed his strategy.

“Joe, what are you going to do?” Mr. Sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week, ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press Mr. Biden on, including health care, student debt, climate change, mass incarceration, immigration and wealth inequality.

Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.”

Here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise.

Health care

Biden

One of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that Mr. Biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like “Medicare for all.” Instead, he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a Medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for — a proposal that still goes well beyond the Affordable Care Act. He estimates his plan would cost $750 billion over a decade.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-issues.html,NY Times,US,TRUE
['Glenn Thrush'],"Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden’s ascent to the vice presidency in 2009. Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.

“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.

The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”

Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005.)

But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.

In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joseph-biden-bernie-sanders.html,NY Times,US,TRUE

As the federal government rushed on Saturday to implement President Trump’s restrictions on travel from Europe, part of an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus, chaos ensued at some of America’s biggest airports.

In Dallas, travelers posted photos on Twitter of long, winding lines in the airport. In New York, Customs agents in paper and plastic masks boarded a flight from Paris. And in Chicago, where travelers reported standing in line for hours, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois tagged Mr. Trump in a series of angry tweets about the long waits, saying, “The federal government needs to get its s@#t together.

Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that travel bans enacted last week have helped curb transmission, but that U.S. citizens would have to make personal sacrifices and comply with government guidelines to avoid a “worst-case scenario.”

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Dr. Fauci cautioned, “Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.”

While the Trump administration has banned international travelers coming from high-risk countries and regions, such as China, Iran, and much of Europe, Dr. Fauci said domestic travel restrictions hadn’t been seriously discussed.

“I don’t see that right now or in the immediate future,” he said on “This Week.” “But remember, we are very open-minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public.”

The administration’s evaluation of the virus’s impact comes as many companies, universities and school districts are already announcing voluntary closings and suspension of normal operations. Last week, over a dozen states began to shutter public schools, and colleges and universities worldwide announced class suspensions and plans to move to online instruction.

In an interview with Brianna Keilar on CNN, Dr. Fauci said that progress was being made with companies like Walmart and CVS to improve diagnostic and testing capabilities. But he cautioned that disruptions to daily life were likely to continue.

“For a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States,” he said. “We have to just accept that if we want to do what’s best for the American public.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/coronavirus-live.html,NY Times,US,TRUE

Shear', 'Daisuke Wakabayashi']","The president’s effort to sell the website as a significant response to an urgent public health crisis came amid a national outcry over the administration’s repeated failures to deliver on promises to quickly expand access to testing for the virus. The disconnect between Mr. Trump’s exuberant comments and the project’s more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about his administration’s response to the virus, even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress.

In the hours after the president’s remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely “in the early stages of development.” The 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.

Now, with Google executives eager to show they are working with the president, the company is racing to meet the promise even as they acknowledge that the debut of the website will be far more limited than Mr. Trump has suggested. A person familiar with the project said Verily was planning to start on Monday with a website that could direct people in the San Francisco Bay Area to as many as three virus testing locations.

Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Saturday that “the objective here is to have a website up very quickly,” and promised that more details about the partnership with Google would be revealed on Sunday. He said the website would initially be used “in the areas that have been deeply impacted — Washington State, California, New York.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly made statements about efforts to combat the virus that are wrong. Even as testing was severely limited, he said that “anyone who wants a test can get one.” He suggested the country was “very close to a vaccine,” despite evidence from health experts that one is probably at least a year away.

Dr. Simmonds said slow-growing cancers, like prostate and cervical cancer, were more likely to be delayed. On Friday, the first day of widespread deferrals, Swedish Medical Center performed about 20 percent as many surgeries as is typical, she said.

Doctors at EvergreenHealth, whose hospital in Kirkland, Wash., has borne the brunt of the pandemic like no other in America, canceled more than 30 procedures planned for Friday alone.

The hospital saw the new C.D.C. guidance late Wednesday night, said Mark Freeborn, the chief surgeon. The next morning at 6:30 a.m., a committee of doctors who work on surgeries convened. By 9 a.m., they finalized the decision to delay elective surgeries, and began developing their protocols and notifying surgeons.

The committee, which had been meeting regularly since the outbreak began, said its decisions were driven by the need to protect resources, like the protective gear that medical staff need to keep from getting infected. But the doctors also wanted to limit the medical and support needs that patients regularly require after surgery, Dr. Freeborn said.

Some people develop infections or have poor reactions to anesthesia, which all require care from the kind of medical professionals who are busy treating patients who have tested positive for infection with the coronavirus.

An older person who has a total hip replacement may need to recuperate at a skilled nursing center — institutions that have been hit hard by the coronavirus. “As you can imagine, in this time, that’s probably not the best thing for that patient,” Dr. Freeborn said. “There are a lot of downstream consequences of these decisions to either proceed or, in our case, not to proceed.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/coronavirus-covid-surgeries-canceled.html,NY Times,US,TRUE

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, went further in a televised interview on Friday.

“For example, diabetes can make it harder to fight infection, and underlying heart or lung disease may make it more difficult for those organs to keep up with demands created by a serious Covid-19 infection,” she said, referring to the syndrome caused by the new coronavirus.

Dr. Daniel Winetsky, an infectious diseases fellow at Columbia University in New York, said his advice to his own parents, who live across the country in San Francisco, has shifted dramatically. A week ago, he said, he was reassuring them about their safety, even encouraging them to go ahead with a trip they were planning to the Florida Everglades with a small tour group.

Over the weekend, his fears about the pandemic rose, and by Tuesday not only was he telling them not to go, but he also was advising them to reduce to a minimum the number of people they came into contact with. Visits with grandchildren are verboten.

A study released on Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation, looking at state-by-state demographics as well as the rates of illness such as heart disease and diabetes, concluded that West Virginia had a greater share of adults at risk than any other state in the country. It was the only state, in fact, where over half of all adults were at heightened risk.

This was not only because West Virginians tend to be older, although that is true, said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the foundation who worked on the study. West Virginians over 60 were in fact less likely than average to have underlying health conditions.

Vice President Mike Pence, a senior administration official said, learned only on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had been tested. At the news conference, Mr. Pence was left to handle questions about the president’s decision, some of which he did not appear to know how to answer.

Mr. Pence also indicated that he might soon follow the president’s lead. “I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician’s office,” he told reporters. The physician, he said, had previously advised him that he did not need testing.

Mr. Trump, who sees strength as the most important quality someone can project, has often equated illness with weakness. Over the past week, he had resisted testing, disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has recommended tests and self-quarantine for anyone who has stood next to someone who had tested positive.

Despite having the imprimatur of the highest level of American government, Dr. Conley’s decision not to recommend a test for Mr. Trump, or any sort of isolation, was at odds with the advice of other physicians, as well as medical experts on the administration’s own coronavirus task force.

The standard protocol is to ask people exposed to a known coronavirus case to stay home, to monitor their own health and to refrain from their regular activities for 14 days, and to get tested if they develop symptoms, said Dr. Thomas M.

As a head of state leading the nation through a turbulent time, the president has a singular responsibility to safeguard his health, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. By letting a week go by before agreeing to a test, Mr. Gostin said, Mr. Trump “gives exactly the wrong message to the public, and puts himself and his cabinet at risk.”

But that decision was in line with the course of action Mr. Trump preferred — avoiding a test whose results could make him face a reality he might not want to acknowledge. It also followed a pattern of Mr. Trump’s career in politics: releasing memos and statements from medical professionals who are willing to say whatever he wants them to say about his health.

Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days.

Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)

['Kevin Carey'],"One way to manage the problem of inexperienced online professors is to increase the number of students being taught by the most successful teachers. Scale is currently a big part of online college, because that’s where all the profits are. It’s why for-profit colleges got into the online game early, and why public and private institutions are rapidly growing their offerings now.

But scale requires time and money upfront. The only way for one professor to reach hundreds or even thousands of students is to embed the learning process in technology. The simplest example is recording a lecture that students can view online. But effective online courses require much more. Many campuses now employ full-time “instructional designers” who help faculty map out courses and degree programs. They also create learning modules, online exercises, virtual laboratories and assessments.

The designers are good at their jobs and getting better. But it’s an expensive and labor-intensive process. The reason that many colleges are signing away up to 70 percent of future online tuition revenue to private for-profit companies is that those firms offer the financial capital and expertise needed to convert traditional courses online.

It’s impossible to transform a college course into the virtual world overnight. Which means the students currently boxing up their clothes and laptops also won’t benefit from the advantages of technology-enabled personalization. Fully online courses are usually, in whole or in part, “asynchronous,” meaning that students can learn when they need to.

A parent with a job can log on after putting the kids to bed at night, rather than hunt for a parking spot to make a 10 a.m. on-campus lecture. That’s a simple but powerful kind of personalization, particularly if people are caring for loved ones who are sick.

While the popular idea of individual “learning styles” has been largely discredited by academic research, people still bring vastly different levels of knowledge, talent and context to the classroom, virtual or otherwise. The long-sought-after dream of technology-enabled education is to build machines that can assess these differences, react to them, and give students a better educational experience — personalized to what they know and need.

There are decades of research in this field, and many promising theories and tools, but as of yet no breakthrough technologies in terms of cost and student learning.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/upshot/coronavirus-online-college-classes-unprepared.html,NY Times,Education,TRUE

A public hospital nurse, for example, would likely not be able to stay home from work even if her child was home from school. And home health aides who have children enrolled in public schools provide crucial support for elderly New Yorkers, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.

“The downsides are very well known: We know kids will miss meals, we know parents will have to stay home, including health care workers,” said Mark Levine, a Manhattan city councilman who chairs the Council’s health committee. Mr. Levine said he had spoken to hospital presidents who have said they are worried about a potential staffing shortage if public schools are shut.

Experts agreed that it would be difficult to shut schools without other severe restrictions on city life, including strong encouragement or even a requirement to keep children at home, rather than simply excusing them from school.

The vulnerabilities of closings without strict social distancing measures are on display in Scarsdale, a New York City suburb where schools are closed until at least next week after a middle schoolteacher tested positive for the virus.

The district was receiving “reports of students gathering in large numbers and some posting their disregard for the risks associated with the current outbreak,” said Scarsdale’s school superintendent, Thomas Hagerman, in an email to parents on Wednesday. “Preventative measures are only effective if we embrace and implement them as a community.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-schools.html,NY Times,Education,TRUE
['Ginia Bellafante'],"Six days before Christmas, the headmaster of St. Bernard’s, the 116-year-old boys’ school on the Upper East Side, sent a letter to parents announcing that he would retire in the spring of 2021. For an institution profoundly rooted in its own traditions and protocols and rarely trafficking in the unexpected, the news had a jolting effect.

“After 40 years here,” he wrote, “I’d like to try something different. (Suggestions welcome.)”

It was those last two words that struck many parents — who at St. Bernard’s belong roughly to the demographic subsets of the have mores and the have everythings — as cryptic. Headmaster Stuart Johnson III was known as a man of purpose and passion, and if he were leaving on his own volition, the thinking went, he would have a plan — to study Virgil, to recreate Regency gardens.

Parents and alumni (who are in many cases the same people) quickly surmised that the decision to leave was not entirely the headmaster’s own, and this made them very angry. Mr. Johnson stood for something beyond the ruthless pursuit of scores, metrics and marketable achievements. He stood for the intrinsic value of erudition. What would happen if he was gone?

As the universe spun ever more furiously, St. Bernard’s under his guidance had kept to its own metabolism. While schools around the country were conforming to new ideologies and evolving ideas about class and gender, for example, St. Bernard’s remained steeped in mandatory Latin and French, blue blazers and penmanship — not Mandarin and coding and self-reflection. This was the territory it had staked among the incubators of the meritocracy, the many schools in which a child could be educated in New York for the approximate sum of $50,000 a year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/st-bernards-school-stuart-johnson.html,NY Times,Education,TRUE
['Claire Cain Miller'],"But researchers and proponents say that thinking about early childhood programs like public school is a useful frame. As schools close because of the coronavirus outbreak, parents are coming to terms with how much they rely on them as a safe place for children to go. The idea treats preschool as an investment that benefits society at large, as primary and secondary education do. Universal programs tend to have broader political support than those that are means-tested — targeted at people below a certain income. And they are simpler to run because people don’t have to submit paperwork to prove they qualify.

For early learning in particular, researchers say, universal options have educational benefits that means-tested programs like Head Start do not. Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.

On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”

A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.

“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.

Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool.

The Education Department released school districts from a slew of testing and accountability measures required by federal law.

But schools across the country were far ahead of the Trump administration’s advice. A cascade of public school closings gained speed nationwide on Friday, with the largest school district in California, the Los Angeles Unified School District, announcing it was closing, along with the San Diego Unified School District.

['Jennifer Steinhauer'],"Veterans, particularly those without college degrees, are often pushed toward low-skill jobs even though their training and the culture of the military might well translate into other types of positions. A clear pipeline to those jobs, however, does not exist for veterans.

“The employers are saying ‘It’s not our job to train them,’” said Joan Lynch, the chief content and programming officer at WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign that focuses on labor in the United States. “So whose job is it to train veterans for the work force? The military? No; they teach them to defend our nation. Employers aren’t doing it, either.”

Many jobs require licenses and training for skills that veterans learned in combat, particularly in health care. Many veterans who acquired deep knowledge and specialized emergency response techniques, for example, would have no immediate access to the long credentialing process to become a physician assistant.

Ms. Lynch said she had encountered many returning medics who were unable to immediately translate their skills into jobs — even when they had privately tutored medical residents on skills like suturing — because they lacked a license. At the same time, those extensive experiences may not apply in other, often lower-wage jobs for which they are vastly overqualified.

“These people have about $1 million of training that the government has put into them,” Ms. Lynch said. “But they don’t have one credit toward a professional degree, and they end up being turned down for jobs delivering dry cleaning. It breaks your heart.”

['Marc Lacey'],"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.

When the National desk gets together to discuss stories, it can be a grim half-hour. We dissect natural disasters. We reconstruct mass shootings. We delve into political scandals and all manner of domestic tumult. Recently, though, we added a new feature to our morning meetings aimed at inspiring us and boosting our creativity before we embark on another long day of editing the news.

We read a poem.

I got the idea from an unlikely source: my son’s high school English teacher, Anne Baney. During parent-teacher night, she explained how she reads a poem at the beginning of every class from “Poetry 180,” an anthology of contemporary poems compiled by Billy Collins, the former poet laureate of the United States. The room turns quiet when she reads, she told us. If she ever forgets to start off the day with a poem, her students remind her. They like it.

And, it turns out, so do we.

While there was some initial eye rolling when I first suggested the idea, Morrigan McCarthy, a photo editor and former poetry major, got it. She started us off with a poem called “The Book of Hand Shadows,” by Marianne Boruch. It began like this:

An eagle and a squirrel. A bull and a sage.

All take two hands, even the sheep

whose mouth is a lever for nothing, neither

grass nor complaint. The black swan’s

mostly one long arm, bent

at the elbow but there’s always feathers

to fool with.

“The magic of poetry,” Morrigan remarked, “is that it jolts your mind into thinking about a subject or theme in an unexpected way. That’s exactly what we want to be doing on the National desk: looking every day for smart and interesting ways to tackle the most important stories in this country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/reader-center/poetry-national-news.html,NY Times,Education,TRUE
['Kevin Carey'],"Yet at no point did universities seem to consider slowing the flow of students into the Ph.D. pipeline. The opposite happened. In 1988, the number of doctorates in the humanities conferred was estimated to be 3,570, and it increased to 5,145 in 2018.

Tenured professors like having graduate students around. They teach the boring undergraduate sections for little or no pay and provide inexpensive research assistance. For many veteran scholars, training the next generation is one of the most rewarding parts of the job.

There was another complication. In 1994, a new federal law outlawed the widespread practice of requiring professors to retire at age 70. The effects of this accumulated as the baby boom generation aged. The oldest tenured boomers turned 70 in 2016, just in time to not retire and not create room for millennials hitting the job market with newly minted Ph.D.s.

Consumer preferences also shifted. Stung by ever-rising tuition costs and anxious about a treacherous job market, many students left the humanities for more job-focused majors after the Great Recession.

All of this resulted in a severe misalignment of supply and demand. Universities had spent the better part of two decades training more people for jobs that universities simultaneously decided they didn’t need, just as economic, demographic and legal conditions began further depressing the need for professors. It’s no wonder that many humanities majors are using their considerable creative and rhetorical skills to liken their job searches to various post-apocalyptic imaginings.

As competition for tenure-track jobs becomes more fierce, only the graduates of top-ranked programs have a realistic chance, and even they increasingly settle for positions at less prestigious institutions that emphasize teaching and service over research. For example, the University of Michigan’s English department is ranked in the top 12 by U.S. News & World Report. Of the approximately 50 scholars who have graduated from the department and won tenure-track positions since 2008, only one is employed at a top 12 department, and that is Michigan itself.

Shear', 'Daisuke Wakabayashi']","The president’s effort to sell the website as a significant response to an urgent public health crisis came amid a national outcry over the administration’s repeated failures to deliver on promises to quickly expand access to testing for the virus. The disconnect between Mr. Trump’s exuberant comments and the project’s more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about his administration’s response to the virus, even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress.

In the hours after the president’s remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely “in the early stages of development.” The 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.

Now, with Google executives eager to show they are working with the president, the company is racing to meet the promise even as they acknowledge that the debut of the website will be far more limited than Mr. Trump has suggested. A person familiar with the project said Verily was planning to start on Monday with a website that could direct people in the San Francisco Bay Area to as many as three virus testing locations.

Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Saturday that “the objective here is to have a website up very quickly,” and promised that more details about the partnership with Google would be revealed on Sunday. He said the website would initially be used “in the areas that have been deeply impacted — Washington State, California, New York.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly made statements about efforts to combat the virus that are wrong. Even as testing was severely limited, he said that “anyone who wants a test can get one.” He suggested the country was “very close to a vaccine,” despite evidence from health experts that one is probably at least a year away.

As the nation grapples with the coronavirus crisis, voters will be looking to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders for a sense of how they would lead a nation under extreme duress. Sunday night’s debate offers the chance for both men to take the cases they have been making in recent days onto the national stage after the epidemic forced them to pull back from large-scale campaign events.

Mr. Sanders, who has issued recommendations — including for the government to offer treatment free of charge and expand anti-hunger initiatives aimed at the poor — has also used the outbreak to push anew for “Medicare for all,” his signature single-payer health care proposal.

Mr. Biden has unfurled a plan of his own, as well as a “Public Health Advisory Committee” featuring prominent health care leaders, seeking at every turn to “offer a view into how Biden will lead in times of crisis as president,” as one Biden official described a Thursday speech Mr. Biden delivered on the matter. His allies argue that in times of crisis — whether it’s the coronavirus outbreak or, earlier this year, tensions with Iran — Mr. Biden is seen by voters as a steady, experienced hand.

His task on Sunday will be to communicate that image to the voters tuning in to the debate.

What Bernie Sanders needs to do

Mr. Sanders’s decision to stay in the presidential race after a disastrous showing in last week’s primaries was partly tied to this debate.

His advisers and supporters have pointed to it as an opportunity for him to fully contrast his ideas against Mr. Biden — someone who has had consistent flubs in previous debates. However, there is some disagreement about what tone Mr. Sanders will strike in this debate, given his slim electoral chances.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/democratic-debate-tonight-time.html,NY Times,Politics,TRUE

Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate one on one for the first time on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders, who is staying in the Democratic primary race despite a series of defeats, has already telegraphed his strategy.

“Joe, what are you going to do?” Mr. Sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week, ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press Mr. Biden on, including health care, student debt, climate change, mass incarceration, immigration and wealth inequality.

Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.”

Here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise.

Health care

One of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that Mr. Biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like “Medicare for all.” Instead, he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a Medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for — a proposal that still goes well beyond the Affordable Care Act. He estimates his plan would cost $750 billion over a decade.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-issues.html,NY Times,Politics,TRUE

Sunday’s broadcast is thought to be the first presidential debate to be held in a closed television studio since the Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960, according to Mr. Feist. Those encounters, the first televised debates of the mass media age, took place at television stations in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington.

With only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders onstage, it will also be the smallest Democratic debate of the campaign; several earlier debates featured as many as 20 candidates and had to be spread over two nights. Timing rules will be similar to past debates, with 75 seconds allotted for each candidate’s response, though fewer zingers and zippy sound-bites are expected.

“Debates with two candidates tend to be more of a conversation than other debates because time is less of a factor,” Mr. Feist said. “While those are the rules, the reality of a debate with two candidates is that it’s likely to be more conversational.”

Sunday’s debate was originally planned for an Arizona theater with a large audience. CNN, Democratic officials and the campaigns agreed to move the location to Washington, reducing the need for hundreds of political aides, journalists and TV crew members to take cross-country flights.

The CNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, along with the Univision anchor Ilia Calderón, will serve as moderators. Another moderator, Jorge Ramos of Univision, relinquished his spot as a precaution after he believed he had been possibly exposed to the coronavirus; Mr. Ramos has no symptoms and has said he feels healthy.

The absence of a live audience will add an additional wrinkle for two candidates accustomed to the reactions of a crowd.

When it comes to preventing such disruptions, Mr. Bernanke said, “that is something, in the first line of defense, that Congress can do.”

The Fed did some lending aimed at nonfinancial companies — including through its commercial paper funding facility and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which helped meet household and small business credit needs — and authority for those programs still exists. For corporate bailouts, Mr. Bernanke said, lawmakers should be the first line of defense.

“It’s more democratic and accountable if Congress were to take the lead,” he said.

Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was President George W. Bush’s Treasury secretary in 2008, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week that one of the lessons from that crisis was that the executive branch might need more authority from Congress to take quick action.

“Notwithstanding tensions between the parties and between the branches, it may be necessary to give the administration broad authority and flexibility to act, within the parameters and oversight structure set by the legislature,” Mr. Paulson wrote. “Congress can’t design and implement every stimulus program or turn on a dime to give new authorities to the executive when facts on the ground change.”

Hal Scott, an emeritus professor at Harvard Law School and the director of the nonprofit Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, said the Fed must restore its ability to be the world’s most powerful lender of last resort. It was unfortunate that such authorities needed to be reinstated amid a crisis, he said.

The premier in-person event in democracy, historically — voting itself — has also been scrambled. Two states, Louisiana and Georgia, are postponing their primaries amid virus concerns. Others, including Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona, plan to go forward with their elections this week.

But for the candidates competing in those contests, confinement to a campaign live-stream is a significant impediment.

The past four presidents, for their many differences, all distinguished themselves with an ability to excel in a room, either through soaring speechmaking (Barack Obama), rampaging rally (Mr. Trump) or a talent for insta-connections with voters in smaller, unrehearsed settings (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush).

Certainly all three major 2020 candidates are being stripped of some signal political strengths during the hiatus. Mr. Trump’s events are something akin to oxygen for him, rousing his base and supplying the live-action feedback and adulation he craves.

Mr. Biden’s best moments often come on the voter rope-line after he leaves the lectern, showcasing his empathy and charm — and his eagerness to shake hands, shoulders, anything in range — more effectively than his public remarks tend to. (Other flourishes, like his recent profanity-specked exchange with a man in Michigan, who suggested Mr. Biden wanted to confiscate guns, can also flow from these interactions, for better or worse.)

It would be the biggest test the sprawling and sometimes troubled government hospital system has faced.

The department is experienced in managing an older and vulnerable population, and in many ways, it could be better prepared than the rest of the health care system to take on the task. It has a surplus of beds in many of its 172 hospital centers and a robust number of special rooms for patients with breathing disorders. Leaders at the agency say they have a surplus of supplies that they have been ordering since the beginning of the year.

Louisiana postponed its April 4 primary for more than two months, rescheduling to June 20, the first state to adjust its election calendar in response to the coronavirus.

The announcement from Louisiana was followed by one from Wyoming, which suspended the in-person portion of its Democratic caucuses, scheduled for April 4. Residents will be able to either vote by mail or drop off their ballots at a county polling location. The vote by mail deadline in Wyoming is March 20, and the pickup and drop-off of ballots will be held on March 28 and April 4 at county polling locations.

Hawaii has taken a similar position, but the state Democratic Party said that a large majority of the Democratic voters in its state votes by mail. The party said it had already mailed out about 57,000 ballots and would be sending out another 15,000 to voters.

['Conor Dougherty'],"From 2012 to 2018, an average of about 250,000 people per year migrated to Arizona from other states, with the largest contribution coming from California, according to an analysis of census data by Susan Weber for the demographic research site SocialExplorer.com. This is why it costs around $1,000 to rent a U-Haul truck heading from Orange County, Calif., to Phoenix, but only $100 to rent one to go the other way, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

On the surface, adding new people and new subdivisions is the same thing the Arizona economy was doing as the real estate bubble inflated. But the nature of Arizona’s growth — and the kinds of workers it has attracted — has changed.

In the previous cycle, the economy consisted of “building homes for people who build homes,” said Scott Smith, a former homebuilder who served as the mayor of Mesa and is now chief executive of Valley Metro, the Phoenix region’s public transportation authority. The recent expansion, on the other hand, is marked by the growth of finance and technology companies that employ people like Mr. Jordan.

The number of finance jobs in the Phoenix area is up 25 percent since its pre-recession peak in early 2007, compared with 5 percent nationally, with companies like American Express and J.P. Morgan opening or expanding local offices, according to Moody’s Analytics. Technology companies have expanded their head count by about 30 percent in that time, while construction employment is still 24 percent lower than its peak before the recession.

“Our economy has been diversified like I have never seen in my three decades in business,” said Greg Vogel, chief executive of Land Advisors Organization, a land brokerage firm in Scottsdale.

If construction and subprime loans were symbolic of the state’s last boom, this time the image would be offices like WebPT, which makes software used by physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists to manage billing and medical information. Over the past decade the company has grown from a handful of people working out of subleased office space in coffee shops and architectural firms to a 500-person operation with headquarters in a downtown Phoenix industrial space that used to be a tortilla factory.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/arizona-economy-primary.html,NY Times,Politics,TRUE
['Claire Cain Miller'],"But researchers and proponents say that thinking about early childhood programs like public school is a useful frame. As schools close because of the coronavirus outbreak, parents are coming to terms with how much they rely on them as a safe place for children to go. The idea treats preschool as an investment that benefits society at large, as primary and secondary education do. Universal programs tend to have broader political support than those that are means-tested — targeted at people below a certain income. And they are simpler to run because people don’t have to submit paperwork to prove they qualify.

For early learning in particular, researchers say, universal options have educational benefits that means-tested programs like Head Start do not. Achievement gaps between rich and poor children are evident by kindergarten, and classrooms with children from various economic backgrounds have been found to improve children’s learning, particularly for lower-income children.

On his campaign website, Senator Sanders cited this as a reason for his plan: “Our means-tested system has created racially and economically segregated child care and pre-K in this country.”

A recent study of 5,100 4-year-olds from 33 states, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, compared those who attended universal pre-K (available to everyone); targeted pre-K (available to families below a certain income); and no pre-K. Universal programs had much larger effects on children’s academic performance and kindergarten readiness than targeted programs, and this was especially true for low-income children. The study ruled out various explanations, like spending per student and children’s alternative care arrangements.

“This leaves open the possibility that the universal nature of the program gets families invested, and holds the programs to a higher degree of accountability,” said the study’s author, Elizabeth Cascio, an economist at Dartmouth.

Europe provides an example: Many countries there provide universal early childhood programs, free or subsidized. In many nations, more than 90 percent of children are in preschool at age 3; in France and Britain, it’s nearly 100 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

In the United States, by comparison, one in three children doesn’t attend preschool. Those who don’t are more likely to be Hispanic, from low-income families or with parents who did not go to college.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/upshot/universal-child-care-democratic-platform.html,NY Times,Politics,TRUE

Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.

“They basically had zero interaction, but I can’t recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,” said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.

The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, “is basically a good guy.” One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president’s view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype — “the hippie.”

Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005.)

But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden’s initial support for the war in Iraq.

In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for “disastrous trade agreements” that he said had cost millions of jobs. “You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden’s record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.

Mr. Sanders’s aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders’s signature “Medicare for All” plan in February. “Disown them, flat disown them,” Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. “It’s outrageous.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/joseph-biden-bernie-sanders.html,NY Times,Politics,TRUE

Vice President Mike Pence, a senior administration official said, learned only on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had been tested. At the news conference, Mr. Pence was left to handle questions about the president’s decision, some of which he did not appear to know how to answer.

Mr. Pence also indicated that he might soon follow the president’s lead. “I’m going to speak immediately after this press conference with the White House physician’s office,” he told reporters. The physician, he said, had previously advised him that he did not need testing.

Mr. Trump, who sees strength as the most important quality someone can project, has often equated illness with weakness. Over the past week, he had resisted testing, disregarding the advice of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has recommended tests and self-quarantine for anyone who has stood next to someone who had tested positive.

Despite having the imprimatur of the highest level of American government, Dr. Conley’s decision not to recommend a test for Mr. Trump, or any sort of isolation, was at odds with the advice of other physicians, as well as medical experts on the administration’s own coronavirus task force.

The standard protocol is to ask people exposed to a known coronavirus case to stay home, to monitor their own health and to refrain from their regular activities for 14 days, and to get tested if they develop symptoms, said Dr. Thomas M. File Jr., the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

As a head of state leading the nation through a turbulent time, the president has a singular responsibility to safeguard his health, said Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. By letting a week go by before agreeing to a test, Mr. Gostin said, Mr. Trump “gives exactly the wrong message to the public, and puts himself and his cabinet at risk.”

But that decision was in line with the course of action Mr. Trump preferred — avoiding a test whose results could make him face a reality he might not want to acknowledge. It also followed a pattern of Mr. Trump’s career in politics: releasing memos and statements from medical professionals who are willing to say whatever he wants them to say about his health. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, Mr. Trump’s personal physician during the 2016 presidential campaign, later admitted that a flattering doctor’s letter he had released was dictated to him verbatim by Mr. Trump.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/politics/trump-virus-test.html,NY Times,Politics,TRUE

“I’m actually even more impressed after today’s press briefing,” she said on Friday, after the president spoke in the Rose Garden, with top health officials and C.E.O.s. “I voted for Trump because he’s a problem solver.

Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50 employees, if it determines that providing paid leave “would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.”

Those exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus. Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)

The bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some public health experts have called for — effectively paying any worker to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.

It also excludes “certain health care providers and emergency responders” from the benefit.

Companies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave. The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the outbreak.

It was a lavish, festive, carefree Saturday evening at Mar-a-Lago a week ago in what in hindsight now seems like a last hurrah for the end of one era and the beginning of another. In the days since then, the presidential estate in Florida has become something of a coronavirus hot zone. A growing number of Mar-a-Lago guests from last weekend have said they are infected or put themselves into quarantine.

A week later, the White House physician announced on Saturday night that the president had tested negative for the virus, ending a drama that played out for days as Mr. Trump refused repeatedly even to find out whether he had contracted it after exposure to multiple infected people.

['John Schwartz'],"Here are four areas we may see changes in greenhouse gas emissions because of the coronavirus.

Transportation: Big Reductions

People are staying home and flying less. That’s good for the planet, Dr. Nicholas said. “For average Americans, the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions is driving,” she said. Anything that reduces driving, including working from home, “has a big impact on our climate pollution.” Avoiding air travel can have a large effect as well: one round-trip flight from New York to London, she said, produces as much greenhouse gas emissions as the preventive climate impact of nearly eight years of recycling. Dr. Nicholas was an author of a 2018 study that examines greenhouse gas emissions reductions in actions people take to fight climate change, and is currently writing a book about personal action and the climate crisis.

The actual effects on your greenhouse gas emissions of staying home will greatly depend on where you live, Dr. Jones said. For the roughly 25 percent of Americans living in the suburbs and another 25 percent in rural areas, cutting out a commute often means driving far less. But about 50 percent of Americans live in urban areas, and for those who use mass transit, avoiding a commute doesn’t necessarily cause much of a dip in emissions. The University of California, Berkeley, has suspended in-person instruction, and Dr. Jones said, “I commute by train and the train is going with or without me and everyone else, so I don’t think there’s an impact there.”

Food: A Big Maybe

Dr. Jones has done research into the relative carbon footprints of dining at home or dining out, but, so far, the results are fuzzy. “We don’t have conclusive evidence yet,” he said, citing the comparative efficiency benefits of eating out and the waste involved in making meals at home. “We waste about 25 percent of the food that we buy,” he said. If you drive long distances to go to a favorite place — like Austinites who drive more than 30 miles to Lockhart, Tex., for excellent barbecue, “that’s going to swamp the emissions from your food.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/climate/coronavirus-habits-carbon-footprint.html,NY Times,Climate,TRUE

The Corps defended its policy. Without using eminent domain, officials said, the Corps can’t guarantee to Congress that the buyouts lawmakers have funded will actually happen.

And that would leave residents still at risk. Imagine the Corps identifies 10 homes for buyouts, but only three people say yes, said Susan Layton, chief of planning and policy for the Corps’ Norfolk District office, which is working on buyout plans in Florida. With a voluntary program, that leaves seven homes still exposed. “You’re probably not doing your best job,” she said.

The Corps applies a relatively simple formula to decide which houses should be condemned, officials said: It estimates how much damage a house is likely to suffer in the next 50 years, then compares that to what it would cost to buy and tear down the house, plus moving expenses for the owner. If the buyout costs less, the homeowner is asked to sell for the assessed value of the home. That price is not negotiable, and neither is the offer.

Such are the logistical complexities of the expedition, known as Mosaic, in which a German research ship, Polarstern, has been drifting with the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean since October with a revolving complement of scientists. The ship is expected to come out of the ice east of Greenland in September after gathering a year’s worth of data on conditions in the remote Central Arctic.

The Kapitan Dranitsyn left Tromso, Norway, on Jan. 29 with 43 tons of food, fuel and other supplies for the Polarstern, as well as a replacement team of researchers and technicians for what is the third two-month leg of the expedition. The resupply trip was expected to take about two weeks, but the icebreaker ran into trouble from the start, when a storm in the Barents Sea forced it to anchor off Tromso for the better part of a week.

Once underway, the ship encountered sea ice that had gotten much thicker as the winter progressed — doubling to more than 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, in places. The Kapitan Dranitsyn finally arrived at the Polarstern on Feb. 28.

After several days unloading the supplies and transferring personnel across about a half-mile of ice in dangerous conditions (a wind chill of minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or about minus 58 Celsius), the Kapitan Dranitsyn left for the return trip to Tromso.

In addition, millions of acres of farms in California’s agriculturally important Central Valley are supplied, in part, by the Klamath, which is California’s second-largest river by volume and is only slightly smaller than the Colorado River. Thirsty farms there have used increasing amounts of water at a rate that scientists say hurts wildlife and imperils the salmon industry.

['Ana Swanson'],"WASHINGTON — The coronavirus outbreak is prompting a heated debate among lawmakers and the White House over whether the Trump administration should remove the tariffs it has imposed on China and other nations to provide some economic relief.

Supporters of lifting the tariffs, even temporarily, say it would be a simple and immediate way to help businesses and consumers struggling with higher costs from President Trump’s levies. U.S. tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and more than $360 billion of Chinese goods have chipped away at profits for companies that depend on imported goods and parts, slowed business investment and weighed on households, particularly those on the lower end of the income scale.

But opponents warn the move could provide China with an economic advantage at a particularly sensitive moment. Factories are slowly restarting in China, as the country shakes off the virus that began on its shores, but the outbreak in the United States and Europe continues to worsen, with schools, restaurants, offices and other Western businesses now closing.

China hawks warn that the Chinese government and businesses will take advantage of any pause in tariffs to capture a larger share of global industries, putting Beijing on a dominant course for years to come.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/business/economy/us-china-tariffs-coronavirus.html,NY Times,Business,TRUE

Like many people with desk jobs in New York, I’m taking recommended “social distancing” measures and working from home. But what about the many at-risk people who can’t? Walmart, Uber, Lyft and other major companies with large numbers of hourly-wage or gig workers have rolled out new policies for paid leave or other financial assistance to those who contract the coronavirus or are subject to mandatory quarantines. It’s a move toward helping low-wage workers in the service industry who don’t normally get paid sick leave (and who can’t afford to take unpaid time off). But many Americans remain financially vulnerable to illness of any kind, including most delivery people, store clerks, restaurant workers, taxi drivers and others whose jobs cannot be done remotely.

What’s Next? (March 15-21)

Relief From Washington

Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on Friday and said he would release $50 billion in federal aid, some of which is to go toward expanding coronavirus testing in the coming weeks with the help of Google, CVS, Walmart, Target, Walgreens and other private companies. (The stock market rallied in response to some definitive news, for a change.) House Democrats also struck a deal with the White House on a sweeping relief bill later that night. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the package included paid sick leave guarantees and additional food aid and federal funds for Medicaid. The Senate is expected to act on the legislation next week.

Approaching Zero

The Fed is expected to lower interest rates again this week, hot on the heels of its emergency rate cut earlier this month. It’s yet another step in the scramble to reassure investors, consumers and workers, who are uneasy about how the pandemic will affect them and how much worse it will get. But interest rates are already so low that the Fed is running out of wiggle room to act further if (or when) it needs to — and that’s already making the financial industry more nervous, not less.

And Finally, Something Non-Virus-Related

The Democratic presidential candidate could effectively be decided this week when Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio hold their primary elections. If Joseph R. Biden Jr. keeps up his winning streak, then he’ll have a clear path to the general election.

The disconnect between Mr. Trump’s exuberant comments and the project’s more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about his administration’s response to the virus, even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress.

In the hours after the president’s remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely “in the early stages of development.” The 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.

Now, with Google executives eager to show they are working with the president, the company is racing to meet the promise even as they acknowledge that the debut of the website will be far more limited than Mr. Trump has suggested. A person familiar with the project said Verily was planning to start on Monday with a website that could direct people in the San Francisco Bay Area to as many as three virus testing locations.

Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Saturday that “the objective here is to have a website up very quickly,” and promised that more details about the partnership with Google would be revealed on Sunday. He said the website would initially be used “in the areas that have been deeply impacted — Washington State, California, New York.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly made statements about efforts to combat the virus that are wrong. Even as testing was severely limited, he said that “anyone who wants a test can get one.” He suggested the country was “very close to a vaccine,” despite evidence from health experts that one is probably at least a year away.

Consumer education is a necessity for the alternative and premium milk sector: Americans are drinking less dairy milk, but it’s still the product they’re most familiar with. For A2, a New Zealand-based dairy company that sells milk that’s free of the A1 protein that many people find difficult to digest, health benefits are a way into the fast-growing but hypercompetitive alternative-dairy market.

Milk, said Blake Waltrip, the chief executive of A2, is a “repertoire purchasing category”: The average consumer has three to four different types of milk or milk alternatives in their rotation. As far as they’re concerned, it’s all just milk. Which means that these companies need to constantly be innovating to recapture consumers’ interests.

For A2, health benefits are an easy sell. “People care more about what the product does for them than about getting deep into the science,” said Mr. Waltrip. In Australia, A2 accounts for 11 percent of all milk sales, and the company claims that 70 percent of their consumers have no milk intolerance at all. Mr. Waltrip believes it’s because theirs is a “better milk,” but it also may be that consumers, long confused about whether or not dairy milk is good for them, are relieved to have a “healthy” dairy milk to buy.

Tell me about yourself

It may seem simple, but our experts tell us that many people have a great deal of anxiety about this question. While most interviewers use it as an attempt to break the ice, interviewees often have the opposite reaction. After all, you’re sitting with a stranger who just asked you to open up. Should you use this time to tell her about your husband, or your two dogs? Or is she asking you to tell her about where you’ve worked, your skills and qualifications?

The truth is, it varies. Most interviewers don’t think much about this question, using it solely as a tool to get you talking. And while some may be trying to gain information, it’s not really about what you say, it’s how you say it. They might be looking at your communication skills, for example. This is a golden opportunity to see if you ramble, or jump back and forth between stories. Or maybe the interviewer is gauging your ability to frame key details of a story that’s understandable for those who don’t know you.

If you find that it’s a question you need to prepare for, try to focus mainly on career-oriented answers: your past experiences, your qualifications and your ability to solve big problems.

['Tara Siegel Bernard'],"On the surface, fixed-index annuities are attractive. You won’t lose your initial investment, and you will receive a guaranteed minimum rate of interest and have a chance of collecting slightly more if the stock market does well. But that’s where things get murky.

The investment is typically tied to an index — often the S&P 500, but, sometimes, a proprietary index you’ve probably never heard of. Your annual return is often capped at, say, 2.5 to 4 percent. That cap can change from year to year, and the insurance company may use other levers to limit your upside. And the performance of the investment may trail the underlying index, because it often doesn’t include dividends.

Then, there are the less than obvious costs. The email pitch sent to Mr. Phelan proclaimed that fixed-index annuities “often cost nothing at all!” That’s not true either, annuity experts said. The costs are baked into the overall returns. There are a rising number of fixed-index annuities available through registered investment advisers, which some experts said offer a better value. But if the adviser is charging 1 percent or more for their services, “it might erase any benefit,” Mr. Dauenhauer added.

Digesting all of the details is challenging. “One of the things you don’t want to do is buy them when you are emotional,” said David Lau, founder and chief executive officer of DPL Financial Partners, which helps financial advisers find insurance products for their clients. “Now is not the time to rush out and buy an annuity because you are feeling panicked.”

Other fairly complex annuities are being offered, too. One is called a buffer annuity, which allows investors to capture some gains, while curbing some, but not all, losses. Then there are variable annuities, which may promise guaranteed income. They are essentially a portfolio of investments tied to an insurance policy, which can be expensive, yet they are frequently being offered to teachers and other public school employees.

Mr. Lau suggested focusing not on what is being pitched, but on the problem you’re wanting to solve. Maybe that’s a guaranteed stream of income, or ensuring you have enough to cover your fixed expenses.

Stan Haithcock, an agent who calls himself “Stan The Annuity Man,” said he’s been selling plain vanilla annuities that offer guaranteed income, but even these come in different varieties.

Dr. Redfield advocated for widespread testing and tracking as the best way to prevent the infection’s spread, while others argued it was a way for the military to flush out or otherwise discriminate against gay members. Later, he was the subject of a military investigation after colleagues suspected that he overstated the therapeutic effects of an experimental AIDS vaccine; the investigation led to a correction in some published data, but no evidence of misconduct was found.

He retired from the Army in 1996 to co-found the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where the goal is to discover and distribute treatments for chronic viral and immune disorders, especially H.I.V. When Dr. Redfield left the institute, his co-founder, Dr. Robert C.

He formed close relationships with patients, and kept photos of some who died of AIDS in his early days at Walter Reed in his office for years.

In his first two years leading the C.D.C., Dr. Redfield helped persuade Mr. Trump to take on the ambitious goal of ending transmission of H.I.V. in the country by 2030, through expanded efforts to prevent infections and treat those with the virus. And he has been a vocal champion of efforts to address opioid addiction and overdose, even sharing with the nation that one of his own sons had nearly died of an overdose and that the family struggled to find him treatment.

Dr. Redfield’s initial compensation at the C.D.C. caused an embarrassing controversy shortly after he took office.

“It is not enough to save German businesses and at the same time send Italian companies into bankruptcy,” said Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament who speaks for the Greens party on economic policy. The German proposals, Mr. Giegold said in a statement, “do not provide an answer to the dilemma of weaker euro countries which are at risk of losing the confidence of markets due to rising debt.”

Mr. Giegold, who is German, and others have called for Europe to create a common debt repayment fund, but that remains a politically sensitive topic in Germany and other northern European countries. At least until recently, Germans, Dutch and others have balked at providing debt relief to countries, like Italy, that they regard as spendthrift and undisciplined.

Refinancing is a surefire way to give yourself extra cash — three digits’ worth for most people — every month. And as the coronavirus outbreak has tipped consumer sentiment from uncertainty to hoarder-level panic, lenders have been swamped by people looking to grab any savings they can, while they can. For the week ending March 6, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 55 percent increase in refinance applications from the previous week.

It is not clear how long lenders can maintain the pace. Do they have the staff they need?

“Truly, I don’t think anyone does,” said Victor F. Ciardelli, chief executive of the home lender Guaranteed Rate. “We are spending all of our time coaching our entire team on the most efficient way to take a loan from start to finish.”

When you buy a share of stock, you are buying a claim on an infinitesimal portion of the profits of that company for the rest of time. When you buy a broad index mutual fund or E.T.F., you are essentially buying a share of the future profits of all major corporations.

The way those profits will be delivered to your pocket will vary. Some of it will be paid directly to you in the form of a dividend. Some will be held by the company or used to buy back shares, which materializes in the form of a higher stock price. And some will be reinvested by the company’s managers to drive growth.

The global financial crisis of 2008 presented a textbook case of what happens when people lose faith in the banking system all at once. World leaders could rely on lessons gleaned from history to forge a plan: They flooded the markets with money and waited for calm to return.

But this time, as economic overseers confront a pandemic that has sent stock markets hurtling downward while provoking talk of a global recession, their tools appear impotent. The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail. Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.

“In many ways it’s far worse than 2008,” said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist. “There was a sense that 2008 was a show that we had seen before — the panic of 1907, the Great Depression. We know about financial crises. We knew that it was just money, and that one way or the other the government would step in and save the bankers from their folly.”

This time, Mr. Stiglitz added, the cause of the emergency is not bankers and their exotic and dangerous creations but the natural sphere — a less predictable realm. The fundamental threat to the global economy is the spread of the coronavirus.

Also examine ways to rework your retirement plan in your favor.

Working longer so you can delay claiming Social Security benefits offers a meaningful way to improve retirement income — you’ll get roughly 8 percent more annual income for every 12 months of delay.

There is risk here, too: 37 percent of workers retire earlier than they intended to, according to research by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. But the risk of falling short of working as long as you planned diminishes as you get closer to retirement, Mr. Abolofia argued.

“Planning to work longer is a riskier assumption at younger ages, but if you’re already 65 and still working, pushing out your retirement date by a few years probably is realistic,” he said.

Another safe way to recalibrate your retirement plan is to revisit spending goals. Start by looking at what you are spending annually now, and look for possible cuts you could make in retirement if necessary.

“A lot of people just don’t really have a good sense of how much they’re spending,” said Wade Pfau, professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services. He recommends using personal financial management software (examples include Mint, Personal Capital and You Need a Budget) to get a handle on categories of spending, and how they might change in retirement.

['Paul Stenquist'],"DPi may be the top level of sports car competition in the United States, but with its lack of a strong brand connection, it is not the most popular among automakers. The only other major manufacturers competing with Cadillac in DPi are Mazda and Acura, respected brands that have fielded excellent racecars but are far removed from the ultraluxury contingent.

The DPi cars must be built on a chassis produced by one of four manufacturers, none of which produces a mass-market road-going machine. Traditional automakers that buy a racecar chassis from one of the four can design a body, but given the limitations the format imposes, there is little visible linkage to the car company’s product line. The racecars are equipped with engines based on each automaker’s production engine, but the rest of the mechanical systems are specialized hardware.

Cadillac’s DPi racecar is on a chassis engineered and built by the Italian constructor Dallara. While the car was in development, Dallara collaborated with Cadillac. The body had to be shaped to provide the necessary downforce and cooling, while conforming to the requirements of the series and the underlying form of the monocoque chassis. Thus, only the headlights, the Cadillac-logo shape of an air inlet, the wheels and some badging identify it as a Cadillac.

The racecar is powered by a 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V-8 engine built by ECR Engines of Welcome, N.C. It uses a cylinder block, head castings and head gaskets that have Cadillac part numbers and are similar to those that were used in the engine of the now-discontinued Cadillac CTS-V and several generations of Chevrolet Corvette. But its vital components, like those of most other racing engines based on a passenger car design, are supplied by aftermarket companies.

These highly specialized parts, which were chosen in the interest of surviving a grueling 24-hour race run largely at full throttle, include a fully counterweighted crankshaft, steel H-beam connecting rods, sturdy forged pistons and valve-train parts engineered for racing.

IMSA limits horsepower to 600 or less for DPi, and that number is easily reached without getting too extreme in engine tuning and specifications. (The standard CTS-V engine produced 640 horsepower with the aid of a supercharger.) Thus, ECR was able to focus on reliability, and the powerplants have proved very durable.

Either of the telescopes — the Thirty Meter Telescope, slated for the top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile — would be roughly three times larger and 10 times more powerful than anything now on Earth. Working in concert, they could tackle deep questions about the cosmos. But they are hundreds of millions of dollars short of the money needed to build them.

Failure to build them, American astronomers say, would cede dominion over the skies to Europe, which is building its own behemoth observatory in Chile, and which will be available only to European researchers. The prospective builders fear an echo of a moment in the late 20th century when scientists in the United States lost ground in particle physics to European researchers, and never really recovered in producing path-making discoveries in that field.

“Europe is utterly indifferent to what the U.S. does,” said Matt Mountain, in a rousing introduction to the hearing, which was held in a low-ceilinged, windowless conference room on the ground floor of a National Academy of Sciences building here.

Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus.

When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

The government is to release social distancing advice for the elderly on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods.

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35.

Mr Hancock told the BBC manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS, and hotels could be turned into hospitals, Mr Hancock said.

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care.

Earlier, 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"", following Mr Matthews' death at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

She said she and her family were ""currently in isolation"" until they received their coronavirus test results back and urged people not to visit them until they got the all-clear.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had recently returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, flying out on February 22 and returning on February 29.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are not being tested, with the government prioritising tests for those ""most at risk of severe illness"".

Tests will primarily be given:

To all patients in critical care for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

To all other patients requiring hospital admission for pneumonia, ARDS or flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

Earlier, Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would be told within weeks they needed to remain at home, with groceries and vital medication delivered - but he did not give details about how long this would be for or when it would start.

Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends so long as they stayed two metres - or six feet - apart from them.

All the UK deaths from the virus so far have been among people aged over 60 or with underlying health conditions.

The Scottish government set out its interpretation of the strategy, saying it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.

""What we're saying to them is, reduce your contact.""

The Scottish government has also published its guidance that gatherings of 500 people or more should not take place in Scotland.

Although it does not have the power to call off events, it has urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" in cancelling large gatherings from Monday to help the efforts of emergency services.

'Start making more ventilators'

Manufacturers including car makers, weapon makers and army suppliers are to be asked to switch their production lines to making ventilators for use in hospitals treating coronavirus - which can cause severe breathing problems.

Digger manufacturer JCB said it has been approached by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to see if it could help with the production of ventilators.

The company chairman, Lord Bamford, said it was ""unclear as yet"" whether it could assist, but its research and engineering teams were ""actively looking"" at the request.

The health service is to stop non-urgent surgery and implement a huge training programme to retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those who become seriously ill with the Covid-19 disease.

What is a ventilator?

A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide

Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery

A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy)

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment, but that many times that number would be needed.

Work is also under way to buy up thousands of private hospital beds to boost NHS capacity should it be needed and the possibility that empty hotels may be requisitioned has not been ruled out.

It came as the government's strategy was criticised by some scientists, who wrote to ministers urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

""Of course there is a scientific debate around scientific concepts but I want to be absolutely crystal clear, we will do what is necessary,"" Mr Hancock said.

An emergency bill giving the government temporary powers to tackle the outbreak will be published next week.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the government is ""well behind the curve"" in its management of the outbreak and urged No 10 to give ""clearer guidance"" and ""much better support"".

He insisted the government had not acted ""fast enough"" to tackle the virus, citing concerns over the availability of NHS beds, ventilators and staff.

He said he had written to Mr Johnson demanding a meeting and to ask what would be in the emergency legislation that is to be presented to Parliament next week.

Why and when should vulnerable self-isolate?

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks or so.

That's why it's essential people don't go too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self isolating.

But the officials recognise that individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves

Supermarkets are urging shoppers not to buy more than they need amid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.

In a joint letter, UK retailers have reminded customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items.

""There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" it adds.

It comes after some shops began rationing the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely.

In the letter, the retailers say online and click-and-collect services are at ""full capacity"" and staff and suppliers are ""working day and night to keep the nation fed"".

The retailers say they are working ""closely"" with government and suppliers to make more deliveries to stores so that shelves are well-stocked.

""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without,"" the letter reads.

That was echoed in an email to customers from Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who said: ""There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked.""

In a plea to shoppers, he said: ""Please think before you buy and only buy what you and your family need.""

Speaking on behalf of retailers, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.""

The plea follows widespread concern over shoppers emptying supermarket shelves as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus.

Long queues were reported outside some supermarkets on Sunday morning.

Items including toilet paper, hand sanitiser, pasta and tinned foods are among those that have been in short supply.

That has led some supermarkets to limit the sale of some products, while Aldi has restricted customers to buying a maximum of four of each item.

Tesco, shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including anti-bacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables.

Campaigners have warned stockpiling could hit the ""most vulnerable"" hardest.

Analysis

By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent

Supermarkets are used to spikes in demand, for example over the festive period. But they have usually been expecting them.

It has been clear from repeatedly emptied shelves that many shoppers have not heeded the official advice that there is no need to stockpile.

The BRC lobby group insists its members are resilient and there won't be long-term shortages. And supermarkets have adapted quickly. For example, Sainsbury's has told customers today that it has increased warehouse capacity and ordered more stock. Tesco is among the brands that will take up the government's offer of extending delivery hours to keep up with demand.

But with demand unprecedented for the time of year - weeks before the expected UK peak of the pandemic - this unusual joint letter from the major supermarkets shows they feel a strong message needs sending to customers. They will be hoping that the coordinated effort will help their strained supply chains cope and ensure everyone, including the most vulnerable, can get what they need.

Some food banks say they have a shortage of basic items which have already been panic bought by shoppers.

The government has said there is no need for anyone to stockpile items, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging people to ""behave responsibly and think about others"".

The government is relaxing restrictions on delivery hours for retailers to try to ensure shops remain stocked with basic items.

Deliveries to supermarkets are usually restricted overnight to avoid disturbing local residents.

Image copyright Julzz Ballard Image caption Shoppers faced a long queue at the tills in Morrisons in Kettering on Sunday

Environment Secretary George Eustice said allowing night-time deliveries would allow stock to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

Meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog has warned retailers not to ""exploit"" fears about coronavirus by dramatically increasing the price of protective goods such as hand gels and face masks.

The government is in talks with rail bosses to put emergency measures in place to deal with falling passenger numbers after the coronavirus outbreak.

Some train operators were already losing money but fewer fares will put even more pressure on their finances.

A senior industry source said fairly drastic measures might be required for train companies to survive.

At an industry meeting last week, passenger numbers were said to have fallen by up to 18% on certain lines.

However, another industry source acknowledged that the fall in passengers could be significantly higher.

They told the BBC that the number of passengers travelling through major UK train stations at peak times had dropped considerably in recent days.

Very up-to-date figures for the whole UK network are not known as many tickets are still not purchased digitally, so it takes some time for the data to filter through.

Under franchise agreements, train companies have a range of contractual obligations, which govern how many trains they run and restrict how much they can charge for tickets.

They are also required to make payments to the government to run services on parts of the rail network.

The number of trains, the price of tickets and the amount companies pay government are all calculated based on assumptions about passenger numbers.

But, with fewer people catching the train - as some companies ask staff to work from home over fears about the spread of the coronavirus - the ability of rail companies to meet some of those obligations is now in doubt.

Emergency talks

The BBC understands that train operators are in talks with government to renegotiate the terms of some of those contracts.

Train companies want the government to give them more wriggle room so they can keep operating services for essential travel for people working in the emergency services, even though broader passenger numbers have fallen.

Options being discussed are likely to include a reduction in the number of train services and flexibility over the payments that train companies make to government.

"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's nuanced approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

In an open letter, the 229 specialists in disciplines ranging from mathematics to genetics - though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases - say the UK's current approach will put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"".

The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune.

The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

The scientists - all from UK universities - also questioned the government's view that people would become fed up with restrictions if they were imposed too soon.

Their letter was published on the day it was announced 10 more people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21.

Meanwhile the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advised that measures to protect vulnerable people - including household isolation - ""will need to be instituted soon"".

Sir Patrick and the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, have said they intend to publish the computer models on which their strategy is based.

The UK's approach to coping with the coronavirus pandemic has been in stark contrast to other countries. The whole of Italy has been on lockdown since Tuesday, while Poland is set to close its borders for two weeks.

On Saturday the French government ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday).

And Spain has declared a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle the virus,

Measures 'insufficient'

In the open letter the group of scientists argue that stronger ""social distancing measures"" would ""dramatically"" slow the rate of growth of the disease in the UK, and would spare ""thousands of lives"".

The group, specialising in a range of disciplines, ranging from mathematics to genetics, though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases, said the current measures are ""insufficient"" and ""additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately"", as is happening in other countries.

On Friday, Sir Patrick suggested managing the spread of the disease so that the population gains some immunity to the disease was a part of the government strategy.

This idea, known as ""herd immunity"", means at-risk individuals are protected from infection because they are surrounded by people who are resistant to the disease.

Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease.

But in the open letter, the scientists said: ""Going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option.""

'Laissez-faire attitude'

The major downside of herd immunity, according to Birmingham University's Prof Willem van Schaik, is that this will mean that in the UK alone at least 36 million people will need to be infected and recover.

""It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths,"" he said.

""The only way to make this work would be to spread out these millions of cases over a relatively long period of time so that the NHS does not get overwhelmed.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Willem Von Schaik, professor of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, was one of the signatories

Prof van Schaik noted that the UK is the only country in Europe that is following what he described as its ""laissez-faire attitude to the virus"".

But a Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said that Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic. Our aims are to save lives, protect the most vulnerable, and relieve pressure on our NHS,"" he said.

""We have now moved out of the contain phase and into delay, and we have experts working round the clock. Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence.

""Our awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible.""

In a separate letter to the government, more than 200 behavioural scientists have questioned the government's argument that starting tougher measures too soon would lead to people not sticking to them just at the point that the epidemic is at its height.

""While we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about 'behavioural fatigue' or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,"" the letter said.

""Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it.""

""In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. Carrying on as normal for as long as possible undercuts that urgency,"" it added.

The scientists said ""radical behaviour change"" could have a ""much better"" effect and could ""save very large numbers of lives"".

""Experience in China and South Korea is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that this possibility should at least be attempted,"" it added.

The second letter called on the government to reconsider its stance on ""behavioural fatigue"" and to share the evidence on which it based this stance.

A drug that prevents the transmission of the HIV virus will be available in England from April, the Department of Health has confirmed.

PrEP - or pre-exposure prophylaxis - is an antiretroviral medicine which, taken once a day, stops the transmission of HIV during unprotected sex.

The pill is already available in Scotland and Wales to people at risk of contracting the virus.

It is estimated there are about 103,800 people living with HIV in the UK.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the roll-out of the drug in England would eliminate new HIV infections within 10 years.

NHS England will pay for the drug.

The cost is estimated to likely be much less than the lifetime bill for treating those who already carry the virus.

The Terrence Higgins Trust, a charity that supports those living with HIV, estimates that about 7% of the roughly 103,800 people living with the virus in the UK do not know they are HIV positive.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'People think using PrEP means you put it about'

Ian Green, Chief Executive at the Terrence Higgins Trust, described the development as a ""game-changer"" for HIV prevention.

But he said more work needed to be done to ensure the benefits of PrEP were made clear to groups other than gay and bisexual men, such as women, trans people and BAME communities.

Sir Elton John, whose foundation supports HIV prevention and treatment, welcomed the government's decision.

""Taking PrEP prevents HIV from being passed on, which is truly incredible,"" he told the Sunday Times.

""It is the right decision for the UK government to roll this out more widely to minimise the spread of this disease so more people are protected - which is critical in fighting any epidemic.""

What is PrEP?

A pill taken daily, or on demand prior to having sex, to prevent HIV infection

If taken consistently, when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV, it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying

A UK Medical Research Council-run study comparing gay men on PrEP against non-users found an 86% fall in new HIV infections in PrEP users

Many in the sexual health sector say PrEP, when taken correctly, is almost 100% effective

It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk, including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed

Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections

But PrEP does have its critics, with some commentators saying funding it will lead to an abdication of personal responsibility, with men choosing not to use condoms.

Unlike condoms, PrEP does not protect against other sexually-transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea - of which the numbers of infections are rising.

In 2018, new HIV diagnoses in the UK fell to their lowest level since 2000 - 4,484 people - due to the success of preventative measures, Public Health England said.

The decline has been attributed to a mix of prevention methods, such as testing, condom provision, and the wider use of PrEP.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51897856,BBC,UK,TRUE

The UK's aviation industry may not survive the coronavirus pandemic without emergency financial support, airlines have warned.

Bosses at Virgin Atlantic will write to the prime minister on Monday to ask for emergency financial measures for airlines in the UK.

US travel restrictions will hit all transatlantic routes from Tuesday, further denting the aviation sector.

""The threat to the survival of some businesses is real the longer this goes on,"" he said. ""They will need to take very difficult actions to secure sufficient liquidity.""

The ban, which will begin at 04:00 GMT on Tuesday, will hit vital routes for the likes of British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian Air.

The health secretary said empty hotels across the country would help ease the pressure on hospitals that are filling up with patients.

""Some people are saying: 'Should you build a hospital?'"" Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

""Actually, we've seen that many hotels are empty so we've got ready-built facilities for looking after people.""

He said he was more concerned that enough staff members and equipment were available to cope with an influx in patients, rather than worrying about where those patients would go to receive care.

""The critical thing is that [the hotels] need oxygen supply and the ventilation equipment - whether it's the invasive ventilation or just the mask on your face.

""So what matters is not just the space, it's making sure that the equipment and the trained staff are there as well.""

3. Ventilators made at car factories

How will thousands of new ventilators - machines needed to help patients breathe - be made quickly enough to cope with an increase in demand?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available in the UK at the moment but that many times that number would be needed as the number of people with Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, increased.

Asked if the likes of military engineers and car manufacturers would be asked to meet the demand, the health secretary said: ""Yes, we're talking to all those companies.""

""We've got high quality engineering in this country. And we want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators to do that,"" he added.

The speedy manufacturing might not stop once the UK has enough ventilators either, with Mr Hancock suggesting the equipment could be sent abroad to help other countries in need.

Digger manufacturing company JCB confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if they could help to make ventilators.

Chairman Lord Bamford said the British company - which cut production and working hours in February as coronavirus led to a shortage of components - would do ""whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing"".

4. Operating theatres converted into wards

The cancellation of swathes of non-urgent - or ""elective"" - surgery will help to free up space, Mr Hancock said.

He said the sorts of operations that could be delayed ""in this emergency"" situation included hip and knee operations.

Operating theatres where these procedures are normally carried out are equipped with oxygen supplies, meaning they ""can be turned into wards"" for coronavirus patients.

This measure is ""one of the first things that we're going to do"", he added.

5. New (and old) staff

All those extra ventilators will throw up another problem - there are not enough trained nurses and doctors to operate them.

To fix this, Mr Hancock said the government wanted to bring recently-retired doctors ""back into service"".

But, the health secretary said, some of those workers would need to be trained up to deal with the specific needs of Covid-19 - which is a respiratory disease,

""We will be stopping some other activity, and asking doctors who normally do other things to retrain to be able to, for instance, use the ventilators.""

He would not say how long it might take to train people up but did say: ""We will do it as fast as we can.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51898207,BBC,UK,TRUE

Holly Eason and her fiance Masakazu Yamamoto have been planning their April wedding in their hometown of Tokyo for ages but now, thanks to coronavirus, they've had to cancel everything.

Ms Eason, a teacher, couldn't risk her guests being exposed to infection.

She said: ""I couldn't forgive myself if our celebration became the cause of a serious health condition. I'm also worried that my dad and my brother wouldn't be allowed to enter Japan. We just don't know what the situation will be at the time and I wouldn't want to go ahead without them being here.""

She feels frustrated - but says safety is the priority.

The coronavirus only emerged in December but is now a pandemic, with countries implementing lockdowns and travel restrictions.

On the day the couple finally decided to cancel, their wedding invitations turned up at the home of Ms Eason's father, Mike, at his home in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in the UK.

He said: ""It hit home the effort she had put into organise the day but as I am over 60, she was very worried about putting me and the others at risk.

""My daughter has arranged the wedding day herself, when most have their mum to help with organising advice. Holly's mum died five years ago and unfortunately, I cannot offer much help from the UK.""

He said the family was now facing difficulty trying to get refunds.

""We cannot get our money back for the flights and hotel, so stand to write off approximately £5,000. I have tried to claim back through my credit card but despite being on hold for nearly 90 minutes (as everyone else is trying to get through too) they say there is nothing they can do.""

The family hopes to reschedule the wedding at a later date, ideally during blossom season again.

For Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi, their dream wedding in Italy was supposed to be the happiest moment of their lives.

But Ms Modi, who is from Harrow, London, said: ""In a matter of one week, our world was turned upside down, when the outbreak in Italy was announced.

""We were due to marry in Tuscany in about a month's time but now we're in a bit of a limbo and have no idea whether it's going to go ahead or if we should postpone or cancel.

""We had been planning for this wedding for nearly six months. We both work full-time and even though it has been a stressful and bumpy road, the only thing that kept us going was knowing we would marry one another.""

She said they had more than 150 guests from coming all over the world including babies, grandparents and elderly relatives but many were now too scared to travel.

With the response to the virus in the UK also changing rapidly, they also were concerned that it might be better to postpone if Britain eventually enters lockdown.

Lauren Maitland and her fiance, Charlotte Armitage, have their fingers crossed their marriage will go ahead at The Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire in May.

But Ms Maitland said: ""My mum has recently had a surgical procedure carried out on her heart and is recovering, while my granddad is 90 years old. Charlotte worries about her own parents daily too.

""Beyond that, we're nervous of large public gatherings being cancelled which would mean our ceremony couldn't go ahead, or indeed so many people having to self-quarantine meaning that the reception at Whitby Pavilion can't go ahead.

""We also have friends and family travelling from Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany and the USA. We're very nervous they won't be able to travel.""

They have taken out wedding insurance and have travel insurance already in place for their 10-day honeymoon in Orlando, Florida and a week on a Royal Caribbean cruise but Ms Maitland adds: ""With the current travel bans, park closures and cruise cancellations, we're certainly starting to feel anxious about what is going to happen with our best-laid plans.""

The couple, who live in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, say they are opting for a wait-and-see approach.

""More importantly, we remember to keep things in context. As important as our wedding is to us, and as excited as we are about our honeymoon, nothing is more important to us than the friends and family who we've invited to join us on that special day.

""As long as they all remain well and virus-free, then postponing or cancelling our plans doesn't really matter in the end. We just want everyone to be OK.""

The couple, who have been engaged for just over a year, were due to have a Hindu wedding with 500 guests at the Oshwal Centre in Potters Bar next month, with a civil wedding and reception to follow at The Savoy hotel the next day. The whole event was set to cost around £100,000.

Ms Deol said: ""There are a lot of things that concern us about the wedding going ahead.

"['Jessica Labhart', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Deb Lawrence Image caption Deb Lawrence said her cleaning firm has been busy as more cases of coronavirus emerged

As people try to protect themselves from coronavirus, the services of cleaners are in high demand. But how are those tasked with protecting others keeping themselves safe?

""It is frightening really,"" says Deb Lawrence, 60, who runs a cleaning business in Dudley in the West Midlands.

Ms Lawrence was part of a team which recently deep-cleaned a doctor's surgery after a patient was sent for Covid-19 testing.

The group had to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), and used colour-coded equipment to prevent cross-contamination.

""Thankfully it wasn't a confirmed case, which was a big relief,"" she said.

'Did I miss a bit?'

Her son Alex, 28, who went out on the job, said: ""It can be quite alarming for the public if they see you in your suit and mask so we try to clean at times when we won't be seen as much.

""When you get in a space where there's a suspected outbreak, it takes a lot more concentration.

""You're thinking about whether you've put on your PPE correctly, have you got enough water to mix the chemicals to the right ratio, have you squeezed out sponges and mops thoroughly?

""Then you're thinking - 'Have I cleaned every possible surface?'

""That's the thing you think about a lot because you've been trusted to go in and do a job and that job is ultimately about keeping people safe, so it's a big responsibility.""

Image copyright Alex Lawrence Image caption Alex Lawrence said deep-cleans take ""a lot of concentration""

Deb Lawrence said the job can be exhausting, physically demanding, and staff were under a lot of pressure.

""For example, a team of 15 of us went in to deep-clean a school and it took each of us four hours to clean our individual areas,"" she said.

""People don't realise that we're in the middle between the health service and the average person - we're the people tasked with keeping everyone safe in work, schools, at the doctors and dentists, so we take it very seriously.""

Staff at Mrs Lawrence's company, which employs 300 people aged between 18 and 75, have become worried about contracting the virus themselves.

She said she was ""conscious of the vulnerabilities of our older staff"", but would ""never put them in a situation that would put them at risk"".

""A lot of the girls have been worried, asking what would happen if they got sick, how best to protect themselves.

""If we found out they were at risk, we'd pull them out straight away.""

Ms Lawrence said her company had refreshed its training and protocols, keeping staff updated on the latest safety advice.

""It's such a new experience in dealing with this that we've had to be respond to things as and when they've happened too,"" she said.

Top tips from the professionals

Clean your entire home often, not just once a week

Pay special attention to areas such as the kitchen and bathroom

Touch points, such as door handles, push pads and telephones, are a particular concern

Use a good quality antibacterial spray or wipe as well as soap but be mindful of any allergic reactions your family members may have.

Stephen Hill, 64, from Norwich, cleans emergency departments.

""I'm only two weeks away from retirement and so I don't want to get infected,"" he said.

""I do clinical cleans - which involves sterilising a patient's area with chlorine - and the thing is, you don't know what they have.

""I don't feel particularly safe at the moment; we're just all getting on with it.

""I put a lot of pressure on myself to keep up high standards, but with cleaning things like touch points - door handles - they're only as clean as they are before someone else touches them.

""I know other people who are also due to retire soon and we're worried we'll get called back in.

""Even if I get the call, I won't go back - I have lung problems and ultimately you might be putting your life at risk.""

Izzy Hussain, 45, who owns a domestic cleaning company in Wolverhampton, said most cleaning was ""just common sense"".

""I think we all know what to do but we've just forgotten or taken cleaning less seriously as our lives have got busier,"" he said.

""We have a lot of vulnerable clients - elderly people and working families with children too, and it's easy to overlook things.

""With this scare - and it is scary - we've been wearing disposable gloves out on jobs to protect ourselves, but otherwise our standards have remained as high as they've always been.

""I would just say it's time to go back to basics and clean your home not just regularly but often.""

The professionals have welcomed new hygiene measures being adopted by the public.

Ms Lawrence said: ""It sounds funny to say but obviously business has increased as a result of this but that's not our primary concern.

""It's about making sure we put our staff and clients' minds at rest.

""Though it has made our lives easier knowing that at least some people are upping their personal hygiene routines.""

Hospital cleaner Mr Hill said he wished more people would ""take it seriously"".

""It's very frustrating to see that some people aren't sticking to the advice,"" he said.

""If all this at least raises awareness of what cleaners do, that would be a good thing.""

A total of 1,372 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, with the country now ramping up measures as part of the second stage of the government's phased plan to tackle the outbreak.

Some 40,279 people in the UK have been tested for the respiratory infection so far. Thirty five people who tested positive have died.

If you can't see the look-up click here.

The following maps, charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are dealing with it.

1. The number of UK cases is growing

The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January.

While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase significantly at the beginning of March.

Since then, cases have been reported across the UK, with 232 new cases announced on Sunday.

Most confirmed cases are in England, which has more than 1,000. But Scotland has 153 confirmed cases, Wales has 94 and Northern Ireland has 45.

Confirmed case numbers for the UK are lower than other European countries, such as Italy, for example, where there have been more than 21,000 cases and more than 1,400 deaths, according to 15 March figures from the World Health Organization.

However, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said there are probably between 5,000 and 10,000 people infected in the UK at this time.

He also said that many people will no longer be tested if they are showing mild symptoms. Only those with the most serious symptoms will be given a test in hospital.

England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the UK outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.

Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 140,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 5,700 deaths.

More than half the cases - about 80,000 - are in China, where the virus originated in December.

2. We are in the second phase of the government's response

The government has published its action plan for dealing with the virus, which involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research.

While the emphasis has been on the contain and research phases up until this week, the country has now moved to the ""delay"" phase to stop the wider spread of the virus.

As part of the delay phase, people with even mild coronavirus symptoms - defined as a temperature above 37.8 C or a ""new, continuous"" cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home for seven days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.

Schools are also being advised to cancel trips abroad and people over 70 and those with pre-existing health conditions are being told not to go on cruises.

The delay phase could also mean further ""social distancing"" measures at a later date, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out closing schools at this stage.

Action to isolate the over-70s for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus is planned in the coming weeks, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed.

Government sources have also said mass gatherings might soon be banned to ease pressure on emergency services.

If the virus becomes even more widespread, the government may then decide to enter the third phase of mitigation, when health services are asked to focus on critical care and retired NHS staff could be asked to return to work.

3. People who think they have coronavirus should self-isolate

If you have a ""new, continuous"" cough or high temperature and think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you should self isolate for seven days.

If symptoms persist beyond seven days or if you get worse you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service if you are in England.

In Scotland, you should call your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. In Wales call 111 (if available in your area) or 0845 46 47. In Northern Ireland call 111.

Testing will now only focus on identifying people with the virus in hospital.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,BBC,UK,TRUE

It's been a week of extraordinary developments, as the coronavirus has continued to spread across the world. The news updates are almost non-stop and at times it's easy to lose track. Here's a summary of what happened in the past seven days.

1. This was the week that shutdowns gathered pace

Halfway through the week, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. (Read what that means here). According to the latest figures, more than 125,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus in 118 countries. The total number of deaths is more than 4,600.

On Tuesday, Italy entered a country-wide lockdown, with police patrolling the streets to ensure people stayed indoors - the country's most restrictive measures since World War Two. Restaurants, cafes, museums and all shops except pharmacies and food stores closed, and tourists were told to leave immediately.

Elsewhere across the continent, normal life for millions was put on hold as schools and universities closed in Austria, Portugal, France, Denmark and Norway. Gyms, restaurants, nightclubs, libraries and museums also shut in some countries.

Spain became Europe's worst-affected country after Italy, following a steep increase in deaths. It declared a state of emergency and placed four towns in Catalonia in lockdown. Even the Real Madrid football team were quarantined.

It's hard to keep track of travel restrictions, with more and more countries announcing new measures on Friday. Earlier in the week, President Donald Trump banned travel from 26 European countries for 30 days, although not Britain.

There are fears that in some places, the true scale of the outbreak is worse than is being disclosed. Iran is one of the worst-hit countries after China, and this week saw distressing images of multiple bodies bag emerge from the city of Qom.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man stocks up on supplies in Rome

It's not just travel. Social and cultural events around the world are being cancelled. All English professional football leagues are suspended and artists including Madonna and Pearl Jam axed concerts.

And there's been a staggering knock-on effect on global stock markets, with shares in the UK and US suffering their worst day for 33 years.

2. A new normal emerges

In Europe and the US, the virus is changing how people shop, work and interact with friends and family.

The UK government said there was ""no need"" for stockpiling, but it seems people did not take notice. It was the week when shoppers began seeing empty shelves as people dashed to buy hand sanitiser, pasta, tinned foods - and the big one, toilet roll.

One entrepreneurial schoolboy in Leeds was caught selling hand sanitiser for 50p a shot to classmates - leading to praise on social media and suggestions he could get a call from Lord Sugar.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Empty shelves in the toilet roll section of a store in north London

In the US, prisoners in New York were tasked with making hand sanitiser to meet shortages. The state's governor said the gel, branded NYS Clean, had a ""very nice floral"" scent and would be provided for free to government agencies, schools, public transport and prisons.

Businesses have been sending their employees home, either after confirmed coronavirus cases among their workforce or as a preventative measure. In day to day life, people - including Prince Charles - are shunning the traditional handshake, some for elbow bumps or foot taps.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prince Charles opted for an alternative to a handshake when greeting star including Ronnie Wood

More and more people have gone into quarantine and shared their stories of loneliness and fear. Concern for elderly relatives, considered most at risk, has steadily grown - one journalist has described agreeing with her parents not to visit them for the foreseeable future.

People are finding new ways to cope. In locked-down Siena in Italy, residents were recorded singing from their windows - something that also happened in Wuhan and, centuries ago, during the plague in Milan in the 1570s.

3. Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands

Much of the advice from public health officials around the world is the same: wash your hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching your face and if you develop symptoms, self-isolate.

The WHO urges people to keep at least 1m (3ft) away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

It can be difficult for small children to take it all on. In London, a mother used magic marker to write on her son's hands to check how much her son was washing them while at school.

This week, the UK updated their health advice to say anyone who develops symptoms such as a new continuous cough or a temperature should self-isolate for seven days. Officials say they believe up to 10,000 people in the UK could already be infected.

""Everyone's going to be affected I think... everyone's losing money,"" Becky Hill tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.

The singer is due to appear at Coachella with Matoma and is currently supporting The Script on their European arena tour.

She says there are concerns of ""potential gigs being cancelled"" in places like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Brussels and Hamburg.

""The thing that's worrying is that insurance won't cover it.

""Festivals and shows are our bread and butter... it's the part of our job where you can potentially make some money.""

Becky stresses it's not just the artist who misses out on a day's work, it's a whole crew.

""If we lose shows that I've already booked a tour bus for and a band for and x, y and z... I lose that money.

""Us booking the band means they couldn't take another job where corona hasn't necessarily affected their work.""

The impact of cancelled shows ripples through to emerging talent, too.

London's King Nun had been planning their trip to SXSW for months with five ""incredibly important"" shows lined up as well as meetings with ""a bunch of industry people"" to try to boost their profile in America.

""That's unfortunately fallen apart now,"" says frontman Theo Polyzoides, who estimates the band are set to lose ""thousands"" in cancelled flights and accommodation.

""I hope music fans know how financially awful this is for the band they care about.

The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.

For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.

So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?

Incubation period

This is when the virus is establishing itself.

Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.

The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.

It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.

At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.

The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.

Mild disease

This is all most people will experience.

Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.

Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.

The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.

These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.

The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.

Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.

These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.

This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.

However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.

This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.

Severe disease

If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.

Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.

""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia

Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.

If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.

This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.

This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.

Critical disease

It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.

By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.

The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.

It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.

""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.

And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A patient being treated with an ECMO machine

Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.

This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.

But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.

The first deaths

Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.

The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.

The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.

He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.

He died 11 days after he was admitted.

The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.

He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.

Much of Italy is currently in lockdown as the country's tally of coronavirus deaths has topped 1,000.

The outbreak is putting the Italian healthcare service under immense strain. But will the UK follow this path?

On Thursday, Boris Johnson's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the UK was four weeks behind Italy ""in terms of the scale of the outbreak"" if not ""in terms of the response"".

Does that mean we're four weeks away from a similar fate?

Not necessarily. Here are three reasons why experts believe the UK's epidemic could be different from Italy's, and why the number of cases here means something different.

1. Different early transmission

The number of confirmed cases is not the same as the number of actual cases. It depends on how many infected people are detected.

The epidemics in both countries may be growing at a similar rate now, but early on the UK had more diagnosed cases than Italy. Italian numbers shot up on 23 February, leading scientists to think there was a period when the virus was spreading without being detected.

That gave less room for measures like tracing contacts of those who had fallen ill and isolating cases to slow the spread.

Professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth says that put the health system ""behind the curve"" in controlling the epidemic.

Researchers also warn that the Italy virus testing system has become overwhelmed and is not keeping up with new cases. This means Italy's figures could be falling further behind the total number of actual cases.

And as the UK adds more testing capacity, Prof Whitworth adds, we might see a ""jump in numbers"" - not just a result of greater transmission, but better detection.

2. Italy's epidemic is more concentrated

The pressure on health services also depends on where, and how severe, each case is.

There are good reasons to believe that these factors are different for the two countries. Since the initial spread, most of Italy's epidemic has been concentrated in the northern region of Lombardy, home to just over 15% of Italians.

Lombardy has accounted for almost 60 in every 100 cases in Italy. By contrast, the epidemic, so far, is more spread out in the UK. Like Lombardy, London has about 15% of citizens. But it has a smaller proportion of cases: just under 25 in 100.

So 15,000 cases spread out across the UK might not put the same pressure on hospitals as they would if they were mainly in one city or region.

The UK government is still planning for a time when the NHS will face significant challenges. But that may not be when we catch up with Italy's current number of confirmed cases.

3. More of Italy's confirmed cases are fatal

The death rate among confirmed cases in Italy is higher than in the UK. As of 12 March, the mortality rates among detected cases were 1.4% for the UK and 6.7% for Italy.

Prof Whitworth believes a higher death rate in Italy could mean that the observed cases contain a larger number of sicker patients. Italy has an older population than the UK, and the effects of Covid-19 infection have been more serious in older people.

That puts more pressure on services.

The alternative explanation for the higher death rate is that Italy's is an overwhelmed health service.

Don't relax quite yet

Even though our epidemic may not follow Italy's exactly, that doesn't mean the UK will escape serious changes to its way of life.

Epidemiologist Adam Kucharski warns against simple comparisons of case numbers and that ""without efforts to control the virus we could still see a situation evolve like that in Italy"", even if not necessarily in the next four weeks.

,"Image caption Andrew was infected with the virus when he was skiing in Italy

""The worst bit is the uncontrollable coughing,"" says Andrew O'Dwyer, who is recovering after being infected with the new coronavirus following a skiing trip to Italy in late February.

""I've had worse flu, without a doubt - but I wouldn't want to catch it again,"" he says during his self-isolation at home in south-west London.

Despite having type 1 diabetes, Andrew says having the virus ""isn't anything to worry about for me personally"".

He adds that the fever he experienced is ""no different to normal flu-type symptoms"".

""I've not been concerned,"" he says.

The severity of symptoms can vary widely among people. Those who are older and have pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) are more likely to become severely ill and can need hospital treatment. There have been 10 coronavirus-related deaths so far in the UK.

Andrew was told the virus wasn't circulating in the resort he was staying in, but 21 out of 25 people in his skiing group have since become infected.

On his return from Italy to the UK, he decided to stay at home and self-isolate as a precaution, despite experiencing no symptoms at that point.

'Debilitating cough'

Some people in his group fell ill within two days, so he contacted NHS 111, which he says was ""very good"".

""I got tested before I was feeling ill because other people had tested positive.

""I found out three days later I was positive. But it was over a week before I showed symptoms,"" he says.

They included a ""quite debilitating cough"" and a high temperature that kept rising and falling.

Andrew is now on the road to recovery - but it's been a long haul.

By the end of his self-isolation he will have spent 21 days at home, without going out.

,"There will be no elite football played in Britain for at least three weeks because of the spread of coronavirus

Elite football in Britain has been suspended until at least 3 April as a result of the spread of coronavirus - but what happens next?

BBC Sport's Simon Stone has answered some of your questions about this season and the impact the suspension will have on the sport.

If the season is not completed what happens about promotion and relegation?

Stone: ""You would basically have three options. Declare the season void - and restart next season with the same teams that started this one in the same division, or have promotion and relegation, either using this season's positions as they currently are or having play-offs.

""All of these scenarios are controversial, which is why the preference is to finish the current campaign - it's just that no-one knows when that will be.

""There are nine Premier League games to be played, plus three FA Cup rounds, plus Europe. Given a clear window, you are looking at about six weeks to complete the calendar, using midweek games.""

Will Liverpool win the Premier League title no matter what?

Stone: ""I don't think we can say 'no matter what' because the option of scrapping this season does exist. However, everyone recognises that would be exceptionally harsh on Jurgen Klopp's men.

""Scrapping this season is not the option being thought of as preferable at this stage. The aim is definitely to end the current campaign at some point.""

Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool team are 25 points clear at the top of the Premier League

What is the likelihood of the season being completely null and void?

Stone: ""It is very much the will of all the leagues and the majority of the clubs for that not to happen.

""There are so many complications that come with making a decision of that magnitude. Clearly, no-one knows how long the game will be in shut down for. But whenever it restarts, I would think it will restart by finishing off this season.

""It is not entirely clear whether players will carry on training. We are in completely uncharted territory here.""

What happens to tickets for fans, especially season tickets - will people get a refund?

Stone: ""As with any situation, tickets are refundable if matches don't take place - and generally, clubs will look favourably on fans who can't make date changes that could not have been envisaged when the tickets were bought.

""However, some clubs have just had four or five matches called off, so it may take time. Season tickets are a different case. The season has not ended yet. At this stage, I can't see refunds being offered there. More clarity should come in the next two or three weeks.""

If coronavirus lasts for the next six months, does that mean no football will be played in that period?

Stone: ""It is possible, yes. In theory, matches could be played this weekend. It is the clubs who have made the decision today - the government said on Thursday that matches could continue for now.

""No-one, certainly not me, knows how long the current situation will last for. I don't see matches being played until the coronavirus problem has passed its peak point, which the medical experts said yesterday could be between 10 and 14 weeks.

""Given the medical advice, I don't think anyone in football seriously expects the situation to have changed in three weeks and therefore the present situation is much more likely to be extended than lifted.""

Wolves' Europa League game against Olympiakos in Greece on Thursday was played behind closed doors

What happens about player contracts if the season is not finished by 30 June - as well as other extra fees such as for appearances and goals?

Stone: ""This is a complex area. Obviously players whose contracts run beyond the end of this season will get bonuses based on the current campaign, whenever it finishes.

""However, for those whose deals expire on 30 June, it is a different situation entirely. In addition, the transfer window will be open.

""These issues will form part of the fall-out from Uefa's meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to outline the best way forward for the European game as a whole. The players - as well as the leagues - will be represented.""

Could next season be delayed - and if so, to when?

Stone: ""Yes. And as long as is required. If the current season doesn't finish until the summer, there will need to be flexibility about when the next campaigns start.

""A Uefa source told me yesterday that nothing was off the table. Anything is possible.""

Will there be any financial assistance to lower league clubs who will have no income for the next month?

Stone: ""I don't know if the EFL has enough money to start handing out bridging loans. Like most businesses, clubs will have to find a way round their present situation.""

Only games in the top four tiers of English football have been suspended, meaning matches in the fifth-tier National League and below are still scheduled to be played

Will lower leagues be suspended because of the risk of attracting larger crowds from other clubs?

Stone: ""It is a fair point. I suspect it falls into the 'cross the bridge when it comes to it' category. I can't see why a local side that attracts 100 fans should be stopped from playing.

""Junior matches will still go on also. There has to be a line drawn somewhere. It would be illogical to say 'no-one can play football'.

Why is the National League continuing?

Stone: ""To repeat, it is the Premier League and EFL clubs plus the Football Association who took Friday's decision. Government advice on Thursday was that matches could continue.

""The National League has taken the option to follow government advice. Notts County average attendances of more than 5,000, so there are plenty of fans who follow that level of the game anyway.

""If clubs get overwhelmed by spectators, I guess the National League may have a rethink but for now, for them, it is business as usual.""

What will happen to TV deals?

Stone: ""The big unknown is how the broadcasters react to this situation. BBC, BT, Premier Sports and Sky pay huge amounts of money to screen football.

""The latter three use football to drive their subscriptions. If there is no football, what happens to the subscription numbers and, in turn, their ability to pay the contracts.

""As with so many things, the length of time this shutdown goes on for will determine what happens next.""

What about payments given to clubs depending on league position - what will they get?

Stone: ""If the Premier League has its way, they will get the payments they are supposed to get because the season will finish. Anything else is guesswork at this stage.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51876162,BBC,UK,TRUE

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drop-off point to receive samples of the coronavirus for testing at Leeds General Infirmary

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

""We're all reaching that critical point now where we have to take stock and go, if I go to my parents I could be carrying something that could kill them. That's the reality of it.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Some people are wearing face masks although the government does not advise it

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Mental health charity Mind also has tips for those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Age UK's online advice adds: ""The government hasn't said we should stop going out or meeting up with other people.

""Most people can keep doing what they normally do as long as they don't have symptoms and maintain good hygiene practices like washing their hands regularly. You only need to stay at home and avoid contact with other people (called 'self-isolating') if you've been advised to by NHS 111 or a medical professional.""

More people in the UK should isolate themselves to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced.

So, what do you need to know about self-isolation and how to do it?

What is self-isolation?

Self-isolation means cutting yourself off from the rest of the world.

You need to stay at home, not go to work, school or other public places, and avoid public transport or taxis, says Public Health England.

""Common-sense"" steps include staying in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keeping away from other people in your home.

Ask for help if you need groceries, other shopping or medication.

It's OK to have friends, family or delivery drivers drop off supplies to get you through.

But you shouldn't have any visitors, PHE says. You can have deliveries left on the doorstep.

Do I need to self-isolate?

From Friday, everyone with flu-like symptoms - defined as a fever of above 37.8C or a persistent cough - is being asked to stay at home for at least seven days.

Anyone who has travelled to an affected area, or who has been in close contact with an infected person, had already been asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

Spending 15 minutes within 2m (6ft) of someone with the virus, or having face-to-face contact, is judged as close contact and a significant risk.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from the main affected areas and some other countries has been issued by the government. Full details of the countries concerned and whether you need to self-isolate are available here.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

The Covid-19 disease can cause a fever, cough and breathing problems. It takes five days on average for people to start showing the symptoms.

What if someone self-isolating shares a home?

If you are self-isolating and share a kitchen, try to avoid using it when other people are there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Clean all the surfaces at home with household cleaning products daily.

Although you might not be able to entirely separate yourself from family members or flatmates, the advice is to limit contact as much as possible.

If possible stay at least 2m (6ft) from other people you live with and sleep alone. Keep away from vulnerable people.

People living with someone in isolation should wash their hands often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds - especially after coming into contact with them.

You shouldn't share towels, toiletries or other household items with someone in isolation and they should have a separate bathroom. If that is not possible, the isolated person should use the bathroom last, cleaning it thoroughly afterwards if they are able.

Any rubbish that the isolated person has been in contact with should be double-bagged and kept. If the person tests positive, you will be told what to do with their waste.

Will I still get paid?

Workers will get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, not the fourth, to help contain coronavirus, the prime minister has said.

This means that people who have to self-isolate or who are ill would get an extra £40 to cover the first four days. This would take it up to its usual rate of £94.25 per week.

Many casual or agency workers may also be entitled to sick pay but self-employed people are not. Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick pay and should ask their employer.

In the meantime, the government says you can claim universal credit or employment and support allowance if you're prevented from working for public health reasons.

If you need to care for a relative or your child's school is closed and you need to look after them at short notice, your employer must give you time off, but it may be unpaid.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,BBC,UK,TRUE
"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

Professional football in England and Scotland has been suspended because of coronavirus. In future, the UK government could restrict large-scale gatherings to prevent its spread.

So, what are your rights if you have a ticket to something that gets called off?

What has been cancelled because of coronavirus?

The government has the power to cancel events if it believes a big crowd could pose a risk to public health.

It is not doing so at the moment, but the Premier League and English Football League have decided to suspend matches until at least 3 April.

This is because several squads have players and staff with coronavirus symptoms. Matches in Scotland have also been postponed.

Many other European countries have stopped domestic football and European governing body Uefa has suspended its competitions. Next Tuesday, Uefa, will discuss the possibility of postponing this summer's Euro 2020 finals until 2021.

Other events being cancelled include music concerts Six Nations rugby, the England cricket tour of Sri Lanka and Formula 1 races There is doubt over this year's Tokyo Olympics.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

What refunds are being issued?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nearly 43,000 people took part in last year's London Marathon

The football leagues in England and Scotland have not yet announced what will happen about tickets for cancelled matches.

However, the Football Association has said ticket holders for England's matches with Italy and Denmark, which have also been called off, will be refunded automatically.

The Who are among bands to cancel a major tour in the UK and Ireland. Singer Roger Daltrey told fans to hold on to their tickets for rearranged dates.

Madonna is another musician to cancel concerts in March - tickets for her shows are refundable.

The London Marathon, which has been postponed from April until October, has offered runners a free place on the new date or a refund of their entry fee.

Am I entitled to a full refund?

Generally, if you bought your ticket for a cancelled event from an official seller, you should be entitled to a refund, often automatically.

However, additional costs, such as postage and booking fees, are unlikely to be reimbursed.

For anyone who purchased a ticket through a ticket-reselling website, refunds will depend on the site's terms and conditions.

If an event is moved and you cannot make the rearranged date, you should be entitled to your money back.

What if I'm having problems getting my refund?

If you have heard nothing about a refund after a couple of weeks, follow it up, says consumer rights journalist Helen Dewdney.

She advises: ""Where possible, do everything in writing so you have a record.""

If you're not getting anywhere you can approach your credit card company, says Ms Dewdney.

Using a credit card to buy something costing between £100 and £30,000 means you are legally entitled to a refund if you do not get what you were promised.

Even if the ticket is worth less than £100, or a debit card was used instead, there is still the chance of getting a refund under the chargeback scheme. This is used to reverse the transaction.

What if the event goes ahead but my hotel shuts?

If you are unable to attend an event because facilities such as hotels or travel are unavailable, the situation is not so clear-cut.

""You've got to hope for a goodwill gesture,"" says Ms Dewdney. ""From the organisers' point of view, they'll say the event is still going ahead.""

If you've booked a package (with hotel, flight and event entry all included), you may be able to claim under your travel insurance - depending on the small print.

Can I get a refund if an event is not as advertised?

It depends, according to Adam French, from consumer group Which?.

""If you've bought a ticket for a Taylor Swift gig to headline, but she didn't perform, you should get your money back"", he says.

""But if it's a festival with multiple acts, that means you have a ticket for the festival and not the individual performer. In that instance, you can't expect a refund.""

What if I don't want to go?

If you decide against going to a music event or sports match because you're worried about coronavirus, there's little chance of getting your money back.

"['James Gallagher', 'Health', 'Science Correspondent']","Coronavirus has spread to more than 140 countries or territories, including the UK, and claimed more than 5,700 lives.

So, what is the disease and how does it spread?

How do I protect myself?

The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.

Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on then your eyes, nose or mouth.

So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important for limiting the spread.

Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts.

What are the coronavirus symptoms?

Coronavirus infects the lungs. The symptoms start with a fever followed by a dry cough, which can lead to breathing problems.

It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.

The incubation period lasts up to 14 days, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days.

People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but there have been suggestions some can spread the virus even before they are sick.

The early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

How deadly is coronavirus?

The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable.

Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported.

A World Health Organization examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests:

6% become critically ill - lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death

14% develop severe symptoms - difficulty breathing and shortness of breath

80% develop mild symptoms - fever and cough and some may have pneumonia

Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. The data from China also suggests that men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.

Treatment relies on keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight off the virus. Work to develop a vaccine is under way.

What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?

The NHS says an epidemic in the UK is ""likely"".

Patients with mild symptoms - such as a new continuous cough or a high temperature above 37.8C- should self-isolate at home for at least seven days, according to the latest advice issued by Public Health England on Friday.

Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.

Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP.

If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. People needing to do so should take ""common-sense"" steps to avoid close contact with other people, says Public Health England.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from affected areas and who may need to self-isolate, has been issued.

Other countries have introduced their own measures For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people showing symptoms to call their healthcare provider, and those who are mildly ill to self-isolate.

The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public.

Who gets tested and how does it work?

In its latest advice, Public Health England (PHE) has said those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms will not be tested.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms will be tested.

If you need testing in the UK, you may have to give samples of mucus, blood or faeces. These will be tested and results may be available on the same day.

While you await your test results, you may be asked to stay at home and self-isolate.

How fast is it spreading?

Hundreds of new cases are being reported worldwide each day. However, it is thought health agencies may be unaware of many cases.

After starting in China, coronavirus is now spreading fast in countries like South Korea, Italy and Iran.

"['Szu Ping Chan', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mark Carney is the first non-Briton to lead the Bank of England in its 325-year history

Mark Carney steps down as Bank of England governor this weekend after almost seven years in the job.

The Canadian oversaw big changes at the Bank, which was given more power in the wake of the financial crisis.

He also led efforts to support the economy through Brexit and the coronavirus outbreak.

Mr Carney will leave the Bank more open and diverse than when he joined in July 2013, but his tenure has not been without controversy.

Here are some of the changes that happened on his watch.

Predicting the future

The world was very different in 2013. In the UK, economic growth was gaining traction, but unemployment was still high, at close to 8%.

This led to speculation about the timing of the first post-crisis interest rate rise.

The Bank believed the economic recovery needed more time to take hold.

It wanted to reassure people that borrowing costs would not rise any time soon, even if growth picked up.

Mr Carney had previously done this in Canada, which became the first G7 nation to raise interest rates after the global crisis.

So the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates tried something similar.

It said it wouldn't even start thinking about rate rises until unemployment fell to 7%.

The Bank also added some conditions that would overrule this ""forward guidance"". These included any signs of runaway inflation, or threats to financial stability.

'Unreliable boyfriend'

But unemployment started falling much faster than the MPC had anticipated, quickly dipping below the 7% threshold.

David Miles, a bank policymaker between 2009 and 2015, was in favour of the policy at the time. He now says the various caveats made forward guidance confusing.

The quick drop in unemployment raised speculation over interest rates. The Bank later changed its guidance to state that any rises would be ""limited and gradual"".

Mr Miles, an economics professor at Imperial College, London, said: ""The problem always was that any explicit and public rule to guide future policy would need to be complicated and contain many caveats if it was one that allowed the MPC to react to unexpected events.

""But that meant the guidance was of the form 'we will do X unless Y or Z were to happen in which case, then unless Q has happened, we will...'. I think in retrospect we got this wrong.""

Martin Weale, another former MPC member who voted against the policy, agrees: ""With hindsight, people found it much too complicated. I suppose they wanted a simpler story.""

Mr Carney also came under fire for hinting at rate rises but not following through.

MP Pat McFadden famously compared the Bank to an ""unreliable boyfriend"" for sending mixed messages to British households.

Mr Carney has stressed all guidance is based on an ""expectation not a promise"", with interest rate decisions always data dependent.

Michael Saunders, who currently sits on the MPC, said forward guidance is very useful to people who don't follow interest rate movements closely.

""Giving general guidance on the direction of interest rates over the next quarter to few years is very useful, allowing [people] to make well-informed financial choices,"" he recently told MPs.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Carney also oversaw the Bank of England's introduction of plastic banknotes

Dealing with Brexit

The vote to leave the European Union in June 2016 surprised investors, with the value of the pound plummeting against the dollar and euro.

Mr Carney addressed the nation shortly after David Cameron resigned as prime minister in a bid to assure everyone that it was business as usual.

He said commercial banks would have enough cash, and worthy borrowers would have no problem getting loans. The Bank was well prepared and would take all necessary steps to ensure economic and financial stability.

Policymakers later cut interest rates to a fresh low of 0.25%, restarted its money printing programme and designed a new scheme to encourage lending in a world of low rates.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mark Carney addresses the press at the Bank of England in the wake of the 2016 Brexit vote

However, some said Mr Carney's pre-Brexit interventions were too political.

The Governor warned ahead of the vote that it could tip the economy into recession.

Separate Bank analysis said choosing to leave the European Union would hit economic growth, stoke inflation and raise unemployment.

Mr Weale, a professor at King's college London, was involved in producing the Bank's pre-vote analysis.

He said: ""The Bank was obviously in a difficult position. On the one hand people wanted to know its views. On the other hand it risked being seen as partisan if it offered them.""

Expanding the toolkit

Interest rates were just 0.5% when Mark Carney joined the Bank of England. They're now even lower, at 0.25%.

With little room for rates to go lower still, the Bank's interest rate setters had to find new ways to support the economy.

As well as increasing the Bank's bond buying - or quantitative easing (QE) programme - policymakers started buying corporate debt in the wake of the Brexit vote.

They also created a new Term Funding Scheme (TFS) to support bank lending immediately after the referendum.

It offered cheap money - on the condition that commercial banks lent the cash to customers. This protected bank profit margins and got cash to worthy borrowers.

Under Mr Carney's leadership, the Bank also took steps to rein in borrowing without using interest rates.

The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) took action in 2014 to prevent another housing bubble by imposing limits on the amount people can borrow to buy a home.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mark Carney talks to UK chancellor Rishi Sunak (left) ahead of the Budget. Mr Carney announced a new Term Funding Scheme targeted at small businesses to help them deal with the impact of the coronavirus

Transparency drive

Mr Carney's transparency drive means interest rate setters now meet eight times a year instead of 12, and publish information about those meetings alongside decisions.

The reforms came after a review by former US central banker Kevin Warsh.

While the changes have been widely welcomed, Mr Miles described a decision to publish transcripts of some of the MPC's conversations as ""wholly negative"".

He said the changes came after pressure from the Commons Treasury Select Committee.

""My observation was that it much reduced the usefulness of the decision meeting because most of the MPC members - and Mark Carney was an exception - decided they would simply read out pre-prepared statements of their view and their vote. Debate and open discussion dwindled.""

Mr Weale said he also started reading pre-prepared statements and described his comments as more ""stilted"". ""I became more reluctant to revise what I was saying in light of what other people had said.""

Transcripts started being kept in 2015, and will be published with an eight year lag.

Climate change risks

The governor has consistently highlighted the threat to the financial system from climate change.

He has warned that extreme weather events like hurricanes, heatwaves and floods pose significant risks to banks and insurers, which could end up suffering heavy losses.

Mr Carney and other global leaders have been trying to get companies to calculate their exposure to climate risks.

The UK government is now focusing on delaying the spread of coronavirus. But what might an outbreak mean for you, your job and your finances?

Here are the answers to a selection of readers' questions. (Let us know your coronavirus questions by using the form at the bottom of this article).

I run a small business. At what point should I tell people to work from home? - Kieren Johnstone, Horsham

It's really all about following government advice at this stage.

Many firms are already trialling home-working for office-based staff before any potential quarantine. This lets them test home working in a controlled way, before having to do it for real.

As a small business, you'll also need to think about your the way you are supplied, travel and your cashflow.

Also, check your insurance. Does the small print include business interruption cover? If so, does your policy have an extension for ""notifiable diseases""? Also, check if coronavirus is covered.

I'm self-employed. Can I claim benefits if I can't work due to the virus? - Mark Gribby, Nottingham

Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits, Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance.

But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before Universal Credit is paid.

People claiming Universal Credit can be paid early to help them until they receive their first payment. However, this will be taken off future benefit payments.

Unfortunately, those who are self-employed cannot get Statutory Sick Pay because that is paid by an employer.

Ask me

Will lenders be allowing people with mortgages to delay payments during the outbreak? - Clare Waters

Some banks, including NatWest and TSB, are offering customers affected by coronavirus the ability to delay their mortgage payments.

This will be decided on a case-by-case basis, a bit like the process of helping customers in financial difficulty.

Payments will be delayed for two or three months. So, it is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance.

Most probably, any future monthly mortgage bills will be slightly higher.

What will landlords do if coronavirus means people can't pay their rent? - The Urban Troopers via Twitter

At the moment, landlords are not being forced to allow tenants to delay paying their rent.

But they are being encouraged to be sympathetic if tenants have to self-isolate, or are laid off work and take a hit to their income.

The Residential Landlords Association says its members should discuss the problem with tenants, be flexible and arrange for money they owe to be repaid when things return to normal.

Most affected tenants, it says, will be in genuine hardship and suffering stress.

What if you're not on a salary and can't work from home if your workplace closes? - Joseph, Glasgow

If you are employed, your employer has an obligation to pay your Statutory Sick Pay for up to 28 weeks.

Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay Statutory Sick Pay from the first day off.

In the case of small employers, the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days,

Eligible employees are entitled to £94.25 a week.

I am buying a house. What if one party self-isolates after exchanging contracts? - Linda Lawford, Totton

When you exchange contracts for a property, you have made a contract. You would be liable to lose your deposit if you fail to complete the sale and, possibly, face a claim for damages.

In exceptional circumstances, the buyer and seller can agree to delay in completing the sale.

However, self-isolating would not necessarily mean you could not complete. This final step could be done over the phone or online.

Image copyright Getty Images

At what point will the government advise people not to travel in confined spaces? - Lou Doret, Exeter

When its health experts advise it to do so. However, this might never happen.

For now, transport bosses in the UK say they're reviewing cleaning procedures. Transport for London says it's using a more powerful disinfectant.

Meanwhile, it's been announced that a London Underground train driver has tested positive for coronavirus.

Passenger numbers on trains have fallen as more people work at home.

Will panic buying continue to affect supermarkets? - Thomas, Porthmadog

The issue has been getting stock onto shelves quick enough to fill the gaps as shoppers strip them bare of certain products.

There has been a specific problem with hand sanitisers, where demand has outstripped supply.

But overall, the key message is that we're not going to run out of food. Shoppers should buy what they need.

If things take a serious turn for the worse, all our supermarkets have plans in place to keep us fed. The big challenge will be doing this with potentially far fewer workers.

Image copyright Getty Images

If schools are closed will there be financial help available for parents? - Richard, Eastleigh

Employers have to give you time off to deal with a domestic emergency, but they don't have to pay you.

The time you take has to be a reasonable amount. You can apply for some unpaid leave as well.

And the government has relaxed the rules for applying for benefits if you have coronavirus.

""This kind of stuff happens all the time in rugby, but it's usually on the sly.""

You've probably heard England rugby union player Joe Marler has been banned for grabbing the genitals of another player, Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones.

The incident, and the subsequent 10-week ban handed out as punishment, has been the subject of lots of discussion - with some suggesting it's normal in rugby and others saying it's not.

Harry Jackson, a 26-year-old rugby player, says it was a surprise to see what Joe Marler did - but not for the reasons you might think.

""People tend to do it at the bottom of the ruck where they can't be seen, so to do it in front of everyone was quite surprising.""

Harry says it's important to contextualise what happened, and that players try ""all sorts of silly stuff"" to try to provoke a reaction from players.

""Things like giving someone a little kiss, pulling shirts, patting people on the head - or a grope like Joe Marler.""

It's to ""wind people up"" and gain an advantage by getting someone penalised or sent off, Harry says.

Jon Hicks, also a rugby player, agrees with Harry - but doesn't consider it as a big problem because ""players laugh it off"".

Image copyright Steve Karpa Image caption Harry plays at a semi-professional level

The 24-year-old says trying to provoke players is ""massively prevalent"" at the lower levels of the game but thinks it's ""taken as banter"" due to the lack of media attention.

It is against the rules though.

World Rugby says ""grabbing, twisting or squeezing the genitals"" is not allowed and is punishable by a ban.

And lots of people on social media claim what Joe Marler did was sexual assault.

Harry says he ""completely understands"" that point of view.

""Especially as a large public audience is watching these games - including people who don't watch regularly.""

He thinks what happened wasn't malicious and shouldn't happen ""in front of millions of people"".

But Harry also says likening it to sexual assault ""could cheapen people who suffer actual dangerous sexual assaults, so this kind of conversation may not be that helpful"".

'It crossed a line'

According to Jon, even if Joe Marler was engaging in ""banter and provocation"", the punishment was correct.

""I think there has to be a line drawn, especially on the level he did it at - international rugby. It crossed a line.""

Jon says the ban ""sets a precedent for rugby and society"".

""Imagine if a famous person can go on live TV and nothing happens - then you might think 'What's the issue with me doing it?'""

Image copyright Kev Weaver, CRFC Image caption Jon (right) says ""it might be banter but there are limits""

Harry has experience of being provoked during rugby matches.

""At the end of a game I was playing, we conceded a late try, and one of the opponents had been attempting to wind people up by trying to kiss people and pat them on the head.""

He says it escalated because the behaviour was not punished.

""So I got sent off for reacting and had to miss five weeks of playing, which is really frustrating.""

Despite retaliating himself, Harry says it's different for Joe Marler.

""Because those professionals - fair or not - have to be held to a higher standard than average players in a club game.""

"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's ""nuanced"" approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

Many countries are taking tough measures to crack down on the spread of coronavirus, including school closures, an end to mass gatherings and severe travel restrictions. But the UK has adopted relatively modest control measures.

The differences can be partly explained by the fact some of these countries are further into their epidemics. But it's clear the UK has adopted a more nuanced approach.

Computer simulations indicate the UK is in the early stages of its epidemic which is expected to rise sharply in four weeks and peak in 10 and 14 weeks' time.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, and chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty have made the judgement call that it is too soon to impose severe restrictions at this stage.

Such restrictions might last several months and risk ""self-isolation fatigue"", with people leaving their homes just as the epidemic was at its height. The elderly are particularly at risk of developing severe symptoms. But many of them are already isolated. Cutting them off from their communities at this stage, when the risks are still relatively low, would create unnecessary difficulties for them.

Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty have also advised against the suspension of mass gatherings. Again, their computer models indicate this would be less effective and more disruptive than the measures they have recommended: hand washing and asking people to self-isolate if they show symptoms of the disease.

These measures, if correctly implemented, could cut the peak of cases by 20%, says Sir Patrick.

""People are very much more likely to catch the virus from a family member or a friend somewhere in a small space rather than a big space [such as a sporting stadium],"" he said.

It's the same with school closures. While Ireland, France and Denmark are among a host of northern European countries to shut schools, for the moment at least they remain open in the UK.

Closing schools is effective for controlling serious flu epidemics, but Covid-19 seems to affect children less. There's still a risk, though, they could transmit it to their parents and grandparents. In addition, school closures would take many much needed NHS staff away from their jobs while they look after their children.

The British strategy is to delay the onset of the peak of the disease until the summer months, when the NHS is under less pressure, and to spread the peak of the epidemic to make treatment more manageable. The aim has also been to manage the spread of the infection so that the population builds up some immunity to the virus should it return in successive years.

Efforts to stamp it out too quickly risk leading to the epidemic returning, perhaps during the winter, once the extreme measures have been lifted. This would be a time when the health service was again under pressure.

It is important to stress that this strategy has been drawn up based on evidence and input from many of the world's leading scientists and doctors, many of whom have been involved in controlling the spread of the virus in China and Singapore. And it is notable that no UK epidemiologists - specialists in the spread of diseases - have spoken out in the mainstream media against the UK government's approach.

There are undoubtedly some who do disagree with the strategy. But there is an acceptance by such critics that Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty are the ones in the hot seat, having to make the biggest calls they have made in their professional lives. So the science community is prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and not speak out, for now at least.

It's a familiar story: I was bullied a lot, had problems with low self-esteem; had issues about the way I looked, who I was and what I wanted.

I was not like the other ""girly girls"" at the school, and children can be really, really cruel.

Growing into a teenager, things did not let up.

Along with everything that goes along with puberty, I found myself pulling away from an interest in science - something which seemed to come as a birthright for everyone in my family.

On top of that, making friends didn't get any easier.

'Rock was my rock'

Then I found rock music. From then on, rock was my rock.

It was a safety blanket - a soundtrack to a time when I felt alone and isolated.

My first contact came from films, and what I could make out coming through my brother's door.

I soon moved on, via Skillet, Breaking Benjamin and Thousand Foot Krutch to pop-punk bands like blink-182 and Green Day, later venturing into grunge like Nirvana and hard rock like Guns n' Roses.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Eileanor started with bands like blink-182 before moving to the harder stuff

Whenever I needed it - which was plenty of times - it was what I turned to.

Putting my headphones on was a way to switch off the thoughts of self-loathing, the anxiety around my appearance and the echoes of unkind words spoken by classmates.

A few short years later, another big change sparked a change in my music taste.

'Full volume'

In 2018, after finishing my GCSEs, I moved to Downpatrick from Cambridge in England and the culture shock left me stunned.

I had an English accent, I almost felt like people had a predetermined image of what I should be like, like I was stuck up or something like that.

That was until my first group guitar lesson, which my mum had signed me up for in the hope of offering me a gateway to new friends.

There was a boy there with a gorgeous white ESP LTD Snakebyte guitar playing these heavy riffs that I had never heard.

That was when metal came into my life at full volume.

I listened to Master of Puppets by Metallica as soon as I got home, and I was mesmerised.

Image copyright Eileanor Image caption Eileanor moved to Downpatrick from Cambridge in England after her GCSEs

Within no time, I had an in-depth knowledge of all of their albums and moved onto other bands like Megadeth, Iron Maiden and Slayer.

It is more intense than rock music - and it came at a point in my life when I felt a lot of intense things.

'Not as much misogyny in metal'

From the first two months I spent in Northern Ireland when I felt isolated and alone, I now felt like I was part of something.

I had found my new identity, spending weekends at local gigs, discovering new bands, and, most importantly, making a lot of wonderful new friends, all of us united through a love of metal.

Image copyright Matthew Baker Image caption ""It was after seeing Metallica play at Slane that I took up the drums""

There is still an element of sexism in heavy metal, as it involves a lot more men than women.

Some people might want to call you a poser and say you are putting on an act to get male attention.

But that has only happened a handful of times and, mostly, people are interested in why I like it.

Something I like about metal is that, despite what you might think, I have not come across a lot of misogynistic lyrics.

Compared to other genres of music, there is not an over-sexualisation of women.

In the scene, you are starting to see a lot more female-fronted groups, so things are changing.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Megadeth's Dave Mustaine overcame addiction issues

I really look up to all the members of Metallica, but especially Lars, the drummer.

It was after seeing Metallica play at Slane that I took up the drums. A lot of that was down to Lars.

Another person I look to is Dave Mustaine from Megadeth.

He had huge addiction issues to overcome, having to deal with drugs and alcohol, and he never let that hold him back.

Giving 'misfits' a home

To the onlooker, it may seems like a mass of screeching guitars, gruff vocals and aggressive lyrics.

But look past that and you'll see one of the most open, supportive communities out there, full of passionate and talented musicians and incredibly dedicated fans - all united by their love of possibly the most misunderstood genre of music out there.

So, to metal - thank you for rescuing me and giving all the ""misfits"" a place to call home.

"['Tom Symonds', 'Home Affairs Correspondent']","Image copyright PA/Grenfell Tower Inquiry Image caption Grenfell Tower before (L) and after refurbishment

Grenfell was the worst residential fire in UK peacetime history, with 72 people losing their lives. We now know what happened - the report on phase one of the public inquiry has been published - but the next phase is spending months investigating why it happened, and considering who might be to blame.

Each week, during key sections of the inquiry, we keep you up-to-date with the evidence and what it means.

Week Two: The architects return

It was a three-day week - returning after illness, Bruce Sounes, the project manager from Studio E Architects, went sick again on Thursday.

Most of the previous three days had been spent grilling Neil Crawford, the programme manager who took over from him on the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower.

The questioning, by lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC and Kate Grange QC, is technical, and unrelenting.

As well as pursuing their own lines of inquiry, they interrogate witnesses on behalf of the ""core participants"", including the bereaved, survivors and residents.

This week, there was a particular focus on what the architects knew about fire safety regulations and what they did to ensure their designs adhered to them.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The cladding was 'horse meat' masquerading as 'beef lasagne', said Mr Crawford

On Tuesday, Neil Crawford was asked about designs for windows he was sent in 2014 and 2015.

He responded: ""Architects don't approve drawings, they comment on them.""

It was a statement which raises important questions, which the inquiry is clearly thinking about.

Image copyright Studio E Image caption A plan of the new window layout with Neil Crawford's notes in red

Was it the job of architects to make safety-critical decisions?

Mr Crawford often suggested that his main concern was the ""design intent"" or making sure the concept was being delivered.

In the case of Grenfell Tower, the concept was to modernise an ageing tower block, improving the layout, making it warmer, and transform its appearance, after all, a gleaming new school and leisure centre were being built next door.

His younger colleague Tomas Rek, who followed him in the witness box, was clear about the priority.

When asked why sleek, zinc cladding had been chosen for the new-look tower, he said: ""Based just on the aesthetics.""

Image caption Architect Tomas Rek gave evidence on Tuesday

It looked better, it was also less likely to burn in a fire - but a third factor got in the way - cost.

Zinc cladding was more expensive and after early pressure to cut the bill, the project decided to switch from zinc to cheaper aluminium in shades of grey.

The panels chosen were the now notorious Reynobond PE ACM, blamed for the rapid spread of the fire.

The inquiry will examine that decision in intense detail.

Should the architects be blamed?

The inquiry will have to decide whether the Studio E Architects should be blamed for focusing on the design rather than the detail of the fire safety regulations.

Some in the business say architects can't possibly understand every twist and turn of the rules, when big projects have specialists for that.

Others say understanding the materials they are using is crucial, especially when it comes to safety.

Tomas Rek was forced to admit this week that he had drafted the National Building Specification for Grenfell Tower using software which inserts pre-written phrases detailing how the fire rules will be adhered to.

That is normal, except, under questioning it became clear he had added combustible insulation to the spec, stating it would meet the guidelines, without checking whether it actually would.

It didn't, the inquiry heard.

""Retrospectively looking at it,"" he said, ""I think it would help if I had a better understanding...

""It's a lesson learned.""

Neil Crawford clearly felt he had been misled about the materials used on Grenfell Tower, describing the insulation which contributed to the fire as ""horse meat"" masquerading as ""beef lasagne"".

Its manufacturer Celotex will tell the inquiry it had successfully tested the insulation panels as part of a specific cladding design, and it was for the architects to use them safely.

Mr Crawford also attacked the official government fire safety guidelines, considered by many in the industry to be so misleading and contradictory that they put lives at risk.

""The building regs aren't fit for purpose and have led to the regularisation of usage of dangerous and flammable materials,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, the industry only reacts to the regulations that are in place.""

Those regulations are so central to what went wrong that the Grenfell Tower Inquiry has allocated them their own ""module"", due to start later this year.

Image copyright Studio E Image caption The aim of the refurbishment was to make it warmer and improve its look

What have we learned from this week's evidence?

A theme is developing in the inquiry as it becomes clear that key decisions fell into the cracks between the companies tasked with redeveloping Grenfell Tower, allowing each to say another was responsible for any failings.

Next week the inquiry expects to hear from Exova, the firm of fire consultants which Studio E believed were assessing whether its designs created any risk.

Exova's defence will emphasise that it was left out of the loop, and could not have advised on designs it never saw.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51859272,BBC,UK,TRUE
['Bbc News'],"Image caption Over-70s are to face a ""stay at home order"" to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, the Sunday Express declares. It says the government's ""dramatic plan"" - likely to be introduced within 20 days - will see the elderly and anyone with pre-existing medical conditions ""instructed to stay in strict isolation"".

Image caption The Sunday Telegraph says British industry has been put on a ""war footing"", with manufacturers being urged to make ventilators in an ""unprecedented peacetime call to arms"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock writes that ""our generation has never been tested like this"". The paper also reports that ""entire families will soon be told to self-isolate"" together and publishes a coronavirus ""guide for you and your family"".

Image caption And there's more militaristic language on the front page of the Sunday Mirror, which declares ""war on the virus"". The paper emphasises in bold that the isolation order for over-70s could apply for four months and reports that 8,000 private hospital beds ""will be used to treat the UK's coronavirus patients"".

Image caption The Sunday Times says the new rules for the elderly and whole families are expected to be imposed this week. A YouGov survey suggests that the public is ""prepared"" for the introduction of ""draconian powers"" like rationing, while, in a separate article, the paper claims that the Islamic State terror group has warned its followers to avoid Europe because of the virus. The paper's travel section also tells readers where they can find the ""best of Italy""… in the UK.

Image caption And readers' eyes are drawn to the figure £2.4m on the Sunday People's front page - the amount that the ""desperate"" NHS could pay per day for private beds to tackle the coronavirus crisis, according to the paper.

Image caption The Observer says the NHS will ""join forces"" with private hospitals to tackle the outbreak. The paper also suggests that Brexit means the UK could have to ""wait longer and pay more"" to get hold of a vaccine.

Image caption And the Army will be brought in ""to guard hospitals and supermarkets"", according to the Mail on Sunday. The paper says emergency legislation will enable ministers to buy land ""to free up room for extra graveyards"", and also features advice on how readers can boost their immune systems.

Image caption The Daily Star is the only paper not to lead on coronavirus. Instead, referring to fears of unnamed ""critics"", it claims that facts relating to Princess Diana's death in 1997 have been ""hidden"" by French authorities.

Increasing concern over the coronavirus pandemic is the main focus for most of Sunday's papers.

""Death toll leaps and forces Johnson to act"" is the headline in the Sunday Times. The paper says Prime Minister Boris Johnson is accelerating plans to buy up beds in private hospitals and potentially make the elderly and vulnerable self-isolate - possibly for months.

It reports the strict new measures could be brought into force this week - a fortnight earlier than medics and scientists had originally expected.

The front page of the Sunday Express also homes in on the implications for older citizens. ""Over-70s face stay at home order"" is the headline as it details what it describes as a ""dramatic plan to save lives"".

The move comes, the paper says, as Britain is ""rocked"" by the increase in deaths. It suggests the new rules will also apply to anyone under 70 with pre-existing medical conditions.

Image copyright PA Media

The Sunday Telegraph claims Mr Johnson has put industry on a ""war footing"" to equip the NHS for the ""battle ahead"". In what the paper describes as an ""unprecedented peacetime call to arms"", it claims that Mr Johnson is asking manufacturers - including Rolls Royce and JCB - to transform production lines to enable them to make ventilators.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock writes in the paper that firms ""cannot make too many"" ventilators - and he sets out how the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said extra measures to ""shield"" older and medically vulnerable people will need to be instituted soon. He urges people to pull together, as British people did in the Second World War.

Cartoonist Matt attempts to inject a note of humour. His sketch depicts a suited man saying, as he leaves home for the day, that he's going to self-isolate. Or, he adds - in a reference that will strike home for many retailers - ""as I call it, open my shop"".

The Telegraph also reports that the UK's biggest teaching union, the National Education Union, has written to Mr Johnson ""demanding to know why schools are being told to stay open"". France, Ireland and Spain have all announced school closures and the Union says its members deserve to see the modelling government is basing its decisions on.

The Mail on Sunday is one of many papers to carry photographs showing scenes of chaos and shelves stripped bare in shops, as it reports that ministers have made plans to deploy troops to guard hospitals and supermarkets as panic-buying hits.

Its ""at a glance"" guide points out that ""at least 10 times"" as many people have died from winter flu worldwide than from the virus since it was first reported. But it also reports that emergency legislation will be put before MPs to requisition land for ""extra graveyards"" and to relax regulations to allow for speedier cremations and burials.

""It's war on the virus"" is the declaration of the Sunday Mirror, which claims that 8,000 private hospital beds will be rented by the NHS, troops will be mobilised and over-70s will be told to self-isolate for up to four months.

The concerns of ""hundreds of scientists"" that the UK response to the virus is wrong, or has fallen short, make the front page of the Observer. The paper contrasts the situation in the UK with measures being taken by other countries around the world: borders closed by Denmark and Lithuania; ports closed in Norway; national lockdowns in France and Spain; and the US extension of a flight ban.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption The increase in coronavirus cases in the UK comes as people continue to stockpile food

Away from the many pages devoted to the epidemic, the Mail on Sunday reports that the disclosure of private communications between British and US officials has revealed a ""smoking gun text"" in the case of Anne Sacoolas - the US citizen who left the UK under diplomatic immunity after she was involved in a fatal collision with Harry Dunn last summer.

The Mail suggests the correspondence shows that - in spite of insistence from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) that it had objected in clear and strong terms to Mrs Sacoolas' departure - a departmental official had stated in the communications that she was free to ""leave on the next commercial flight"". The FCO insists it acted properly and lawfully.

Image copyright Aiken Standard Archive Image caption Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003

And the paper also brings us news of a new phenomenon, which may bring timely inspiration for those facing the prospect of self-isolation. Following the rise of the ""silver surfer"", it's now the turn of the ""PlayStation pensioner"".

It says the State of Online Gaming report, which quizzed 4,500 people, found that some pensioners spend almost three hours a day on their consoles, while 7% said they'd played a game continuously for five to 10 hours.

""Barmy Army"" is the Sun on Sunday's headline as it reports that just 21 injured veterans have been seen at a new £300m armed forces rehabilitation centre since it opened in Loughborough in 2018.

Treatment at the centre is only guaranteed for serving personnel. The paper points out that this leaves thousands injured on the frontline who've since left service to ""go through the NHS"", putting ""more strain"" on local services. It says charities and politicians are calling for a more ""common sense"" approach.

And the Sunday Times concludes that couples are dropping ""the blame game"" after figures show that the number of people citing adultery as a reason for divorce has more than halved in the past decade. A bill to introduce ""no fault"" divorce is currently passing through Parliament, but, at the moment, the most common ground given is ""unreasonable behaviour"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-51893135,BBC,UK,TRUE

Mencap in Kenysham said two of its runners, Ali and Russ would be running the distance along the Tarka Trail in North Devon.

Lizzie Passingham said she is running with a special educational needs pupil from Three Ways School in Bath along their own route from Saltford towards Bristol with the school dog.

""He'll be in his wheelchair being pushed by his incredible teacher Veryan Cranston,"" said Ms Passingham.

She said they had pulled out ""to make sure that we protect our other vulnerable pupils"".

""We're getting together some old Bath half kit - a medal, shirt, goodie bag and a finishing tape for him so that he's still able to experience the 'event' as best he can,"" she added.

Some though, were supportive of the run being held, saying it was ""one last hurrah for Bath before lockdown"".

A number of organisations said they were not taking part including Bath Rugby Foundation, which said it did ""not want to put any of our supporters or their loved ones at risk"".

Dorothy House Hospice and the Forever Friends Appeal said runners were told ""it's their choice whether they run or not"".

It said those people should not to attend a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital and only contact NHS 111 if they ""cannot cope"" with the symptoms at home or their condition worsens.

On the day the couple finally decided to cancel, their wedding invitations turned up at the home of Ms Eason's father, Mike, at his home in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in the UK.

He said: ""It hit home the effort she had put into organise the day but as I am over 60, she was very worried about putting me and the others at risk.

He said the family was now facing difficulty trying to get refunds.

""We cannot get our money back for the flights and hotel, so stand to write off approximately £5,000. I have tried to claim back through my credit card but despite being on hold for nearly 90 minutes (as everyone else is trying to get through too) they say there is nothing they can do.""

The family hopes to reschedule the wedding at a later date, ideally during blossom season again.

For Saavan Nathwani and Risha Modi, their dream wedding in Italy was supposed to be the happiest moment of their lives.

But Ms Modi, who is from Harrow, London, said: ""In a matter of one week, our world was turned upside down, when the outbreak in Italy was announced.

""We were due to marry in Tuscany in about a month's time but now we're in a bit of a limbo and have no idea whether it's going to go ahead or if we should postpone or cancel.

""We had been planning for this wedding for nearly six months. We both work full-time and even though it has been a stressful and bumpy road, the only thing that kept us going was knowing we would marry one another.""

She said they had more than 150 guests from coming all over the world including babies, grandparents and elderly relatives but many were now too scared to travel.

With the response to the virus in the UK also changing rapidly, they also were concerned that it might be better to postpone if Britain eventually enters lockdown.

""Beyond that, we're nervous of large public gatherings being cancelled which would mean our ceremony couldn't go ahead, or indeed so many people having to self-quarantine meaning that the reception at Whitby Pavilion can't go ahead.

""We also have friends and family travelling from Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Germany and the USA. We're very nervous they won't be able to travel.""

They have taken out wedding insurance and have travel insurance already in place for their 10-day honeymoon in Orlando, Florida and a week on a Royal Caribbean cruise but Ms Maitland adds: ""With the current travel bans, park closures and cruise cancellations, we're certainly starting to feel anxious about what is going to happen with our best-laid plans.""

The couple, who live in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, say they are opting for a wait-and-see approach.

""More importantly, we remember to keep things in context. As important as our wedding is to us, and as excited as we are about our honeymoon, nothing is more important to us than the friends and family who we've invited to join us on that special day.

""As long as they all remain well and virus-free, then postponing or cancelling our plans doesn't really matter in the end. We just want everyone to be OK.""

"['M Ilyas Khan', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Geo Image caption Shakilur Rahman has been arrested and remanded in custody for 12 days

The authorities in Pakistan have arrested one of the country's leading media magnates on charges he illegally obtained government land more than 30 years ago.

Mir Shakilur Rahman is the editor-in-chief of the Jang group which owns some of Pakistan's most widely circulated newspapers, as well as the popular Geo television network.

The arrest is being seen by journalists and human rights activists as more evidence that free media and political dissent are being silenced in Pakistan.

Mr Rahman, who denies the accusations against him, appeared in court on Friday and was remanded in custody. He has not been formally charged.

What was Mr Rahman detained for?

The charges against him relating to the purchase of several plots of land in Lahore go back to 1986.

Image copyright Jang Image caption Shakilur Rahman owns one of Pakistan's largest media groups

Pakistan's anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), has alleged that in that year, when future PM Nawaz Sharif was chief minister of Punjab province, he let Mr Rahman illegally acquire more government-owned-land than he was allowed by law.

Dawn newspaper quoted a NAB official as saying Mr Rahman was entitled to four acres of land under the Lahore Development Authority's ""land exemption policy"", but he acquired more than 13 acres.

NAB says this was illegal and amounted to a political bribe.

Mr Rahman says he bought the land from a private party and paid all the necessary taxes and duties, for which he has documents. He also says the purchase is a civil matter and therefore beyond the writ of an anti-crime agency like NAB.

Is that what it's really about?

Irrespective of the merits of the case, many doubt NAB is carrying out its duties honestly. It often takes action against those who question government policies.

The arrest has triggered widespread criticism from journalists' bodies, rights groups and the political opposition.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has expressed ""deep concern"" over the arrest.

Image copyright AAMIR QURESHI/AFP Image caption Jang has more on-the-ground reporters across the country than any other media group

""There remains a strong suspicion that such actions by NAB are selective, arbitrary and politically motivated,"" HRCP tweeted. ""The journalist community sees this as yet another attempt to gag a beleaguered independent press.""

The Pakistan Broadcasters' Association (PBA) pointed out that ""arresting the editor-in-chief of a media house while the case is still under inquiry… appears to be an attempt at harassment"".

Mr Rahman's daughter, Anamta, called the arrest ""illegal, even by NAB's rules"".

""This is a fight for freedom of media,"" she told the BBC. ""Today it's the editor-in-chief of Jang - tomorrow it can be anyone.""

Jang Group is Pakistan's largest media house, with more on-the-ground reporters across the country than anyone else, giving it a clear edge in Pakistan's increasingly competitive media environment.

In recent months, top anchors of its Geo television network have given government officials a hard time in interviews on a number of occasions.

Requesting anonymity, a veteran journalist in Lahore told the BBC that while there may be some truth in NAB's allegations, ""there's no doubt it's a selective move because evidence of illegal financial activities by owners of the so-called 'friendly' media have also been cropping up from time to time but NAB doesn't seem to be bothered"".

How free is the press in Pakistan?

Not very - the country comes way down press freedom indexes. The media has come under increased censorship since 2018 when the military was accused of rigging national elections to bring Prime Minister Imran Khan's PTI party to power.

But backdoor moves to quell media voices had begun much earlier.

In 2014, a top Geo talk show host Hamid Mir was shot and badly wounded.

Image caption Hamid Mir said the ISI spy agency was behind the 2014 attack on him

No-one was ever brought to justice for the attack, and many suspected he was being punished for his vigorous coverage of missing persons in Balochistan province, where the army has fought an armed separatist insurgency for more than a decade.

Most disappearances are blamed on the military. Pakistan's media have stopped covering the issue.

In 2017, a number of social media bloggers critical of religious groups and Pakistan's powerful military went missing for several weeks. They were released afterwards, and most went abroad.

The following year, a well-known journalist and social media activist, Taha Siddiqui, who had been warned by the military authorities a number of times, was attacked on an Islamabad road in broad daylight.

He was able to escape from the scene but has since left the country and is living in France.

Since 2018, the media has come under a more comprehensive censorship.

This includes threats to individual journalists, and briefly or completely shutting TV channels or influencing cable operators to demote them in the channels list so fewer viewers find them.

How successful has NAB been in fighting corruption?

The bureau was founded in 2000 by Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf to go after corrupt politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.

But it was largely seen as an attempt by the military government to clip the wings of the two largest political parties at the time - the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of Nawaz Sharif, which Pervez Musharraf had overthrown in an army coup a year earlier, and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP).

During the mid-2000s, NAB found ways to drop corruption charges against all those politicians who quit these two parties and joined the one led by Gen Musharraf or allied with it.

Since the controversial election of 2018 that brought Imran Khan to power, the agency has arrested opposition politicians and kept them in custody for prolonged periods.

Government opponents say evidence has yet to be produced that would stand the test of law in a court.

Indian authorities have announced the release of a veteran Kashmiri MP and former chief minister who had been in detention for seven months.

The order did not give any reason for Farooq Abdullah's release.

He said he was ""grateful"" to all those who fought for his freedom, and called for the release of other detainees.

He was among thousands of local leaders put under house arrest a day before the disputed region was stripped of its semi-autonomous status in August.

The government deployed tens of thousands of troops to quell unrest and enforced a crackdown on communications.

Mr Abdullah's detention under the controversial Public Safety Act (PSA) had generated debate, especially as he is an MP. Days ago, eight opposition parties wrote a letter to the government, demanding his release along with other Kashmiri leaders.

The joint resolution warned that ""democratic dissent is being muzzled"" in the state.

Two other former chief ministers - including Mr Abdullah's son Omar and Mehbooba Mufti - are still in detention.

Thousands of others, including political party workers, activists and lawyers are also in custody, with many taken to jails in cities outside the region.

The government said the move, decried by critics as draconian, was necessary to maintain law and public order in the region. It also moved to block internet and mobile connectivity in the region - these have only been partially restored.

A five-time chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir, Mr Abdullah was widely considered to be a ""pro-India"" politician in the state.

Both India and Pakistan claim the region in its entirety, but control only parts of it.

When he was first placed under house arrest, MPs demanded an explanation as the procedure is to inform parliament if a member of the house is to be arrested.

This prompted Home Minister Amit Shah to tell the house that Mr Abdullah was ""not detained or arrested"".

In one of his last public interviews since then, Mr Abdullah gave an emotional television interview where he accused Mr Shah of lying.

""Why would I stay inside my house on my own will when my state is being burnt, when my people are being executed in jails? This is not the India I believe in,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51869134,BBC,Asia,TRUE

Immediately after the attacks, Ms Ardern said the government would bring in laws to make it harder for New Zealanders to access firearms.

In April, less than a month after the shootings, parliament voted by 119 to 1 to change the gun laws.

Military-style semi-automatic weapons were banned, as were parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.

In June, a buy-back scheme began, where the government would compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons.

Prime Minister Arden told reporters on Friday that, under the scheme, 60,907 prohibited firearms have been removed from circulation.

It is not everyday that an octogenarian goes viral on Instagram. It's even more unusual if that octogenarian is a billionaire businessman with a carefully cultivated reputation as a reclusive tycoon.

But perhaps the most unusual bit of this particular story is the friendship which led to Ratan Tata's emergence as India's newest social media star.

Indeed, without the help of Shantanu Naidu, the 27-year-old who introduced him to the social media platform and taught him about hashtags and trends, the world would not have discovered their latest ""man crush"".

Mr Naidu hopes that the mix of old family pictures, snapshots of dogs and photographs of the mogul's younger days - including one from five decades earlier which garnered more than half a million hits - will give people a glimpse of the man behind the tycoon.

The man who led the salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group for 21 years, who he now classes among his closest friends.

These days, the two of them do everything together - from getting haircuts to watching films. Their ""intergenerational friendship"" may be quite unusual, but, Mr Naidu says, it is also pretty special.

""He's been a hard boss, a core mentor as well as an understanding friend,"" he told the BBC.

So how did this doe-eyed, curly-haired millennial become business assistant and best friends to one of India's most internationally-recognised business leaders?

Image copyright Shantanu Naidu Image caption Mr Naidu's non-profit provides stray dogs with glow-in-the-dark collars

Mr Naidu is, in fact, a fifth generation Tata employee. However, although his family has a strong connection to the Tata brand, he never thought he would end up working so closely with the man responsible for so much of it.

It was a mutual love of dogs which brought the two together while the younger man was working for one of Mr Tata's companies in the city of Pune, west India.

At the time, Mr Naidu was also running a social initiative called Motopaws, which makes glow-in-the-dark collars for stray dogs. His work was highlighted in the company newsletter, prompting Mr Tata to write him a letter inviting him to Mumbai.

""Shantanu and I first met because of our common concern and affection for stray dogs,"" Mr Tata explained in an email to the BBC. ""He has led a team of young college students to 'adopt' these dogs and give them affection, food, find homes for them and give them a sense of belonging.""

The meeting would prove to be the first of many.

""While Motopaws was scaling up, we became closer. Work emails slowly turned into asking questions about one another,"" Mr Naidu said.

But soon after their friendship took off, Mr Naidu had to leave India for university in the US.

""I was really sad because it felt like I had just discovered a friend in Mr Tata,"" he said.

But the connection between the two strengthened. Mr Naidu ended up at Mr Tata's alma mater, Cornell University, and soon started work on the businessman's dream project, building a veterinary hospital in Mumbai. The construction for this hospital is set to begin later this year.

Mr Tata even attended his graduation.

""I had mentioned it to him in passing and he said yes,"" Mr Naidu recalls. ""Cut to the actual day and there he was!""

Image copyright Shantanu Naidu Image caption Mr Naidu graduated from Mr Tata's alma mater, Cornell University

On his return to India, Mr Naidu took up a job as as Mr Tata's business assistant.

""Everything for me changed in a single minute. I had never imagined my life would pan out this way,"" he said.

Mr Tata told the BBC: ""I enjoy seeing Shantanu's freshness and concern. We never see enough of this in the 'dog eat dog' world we live in.'""

So, what does a typical day look like as business assistant to Mr Tata?

""At meetings, I take copious notes and keep records for future discussions. As Mr Tata walks in, I'm there to brief him on the happenings of the day. He gives me his plan and we start attacking it one by one. He's a very focused worker - non-stop, no breaks,"" Mr Naidu explained.

The Tata Group patriarch is known to have invested in more than 73 Indian start-ups, including ride-hailing service, Ola. Mr Tata now uses the Instagram profile Mr Naidu helped set up to connect with the youth and has also shared ""a recipe"" for successful start-up pitches.

The 82-year-old has also used it to share the aforementioned picture of him in his 20s - using the popular hashtag Throwback Thursday - to set the internet alight.

But it isn't just business. The two remain fast friends.

He added that they both like action comedy films such as The Other Guys and The Lone Ranger. A series about experiences in the Israel Defence Force called Fauda is Mr Tata's favourite Netflix binge, Mr Naidu said.

Last year during a radio interview with the BBC, I met Mr Tata and Mr Naidu.

It was easy to sense a warm bond between the two - there seemed to be a great degree of camaraderie and mutual respect. Mr Tata spoke about his retirement plans and love for dogs.

Nowadays, Mr Naidu continues to also work on the project that brought Mr Tata and him together in the first place.

Motopaws has expanded over the years and it now operating in four countries. But it isn't just the non-profit that's evolving.

""If something were to bother me or make me happy, he would be the first person I would call. The foundation is there, but it's like a constantly blossoming tree. Mr Tata has always been there for me and I try to do the same for him,"" Mr Naidu said with a smile.

"['Swaminathan', 'Natarajan', 'Khadeeja Arif', 'Bbc World Service']","Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mohammad Shareef began burying bodies after his son's death

Mohammad Shareef never got to bury his son. Instead, he has spent the last 27 years burying the unclaimed sons and daughters of thousands of other families.

It took a month for police to tell Mr Shareef that his son had died, and even then, they couldn't tell him where, or how.

All Mr Shareef knows is that his son, Mohammad Rais, was one of almost 2,000 people killed in the Hindu-Muslim riots which engulfed India following the destruction of a mosque on a disputed religious site in 1992.

Mr Shareef doesn't even know where the 25-year-old was buried.

""Police told me his body had decomposed,"" Mr Shareef recalled, almost three decades on. ""We didn't see his body. We only got his clothes.""

But a few months later, he would witness something which would change his life forever.

""One day I saw police officers throwing a body into a river. I was horrified,"" Mr Shareef says.

Along with the horror, came a realisation.

""I think my son's body might have been thrown into a river, just like other such dead bodies. That day I said to myself, from today I am the guardian of abandoned dead bodies and I will give them a proper funeral.""

Image copyright Mohd Shabbir Image caption Mr Shareef says his wife Bibi never recovered from the death of their son

Unclaimed bodies pile up in India for a host of reasons: they could be people who lost their lives in road and rail accidents, or people who died far from home - pilgrims, migrants, old people abandoned by their children.

Some impoverished patients die in hospital with no-one to take care of the funeral.

But what to do with the bodies? Back in 1992, many districts in India didn't have a mortuary facility. It was fairly common practice to dispose of unclaimed bodies quickly.

Burial was the preferred method, but in some places in north India they dumped unclaimed human remains into rivers to save money, time and effort.

More stories from India

Mr Shareef's family have long suspected that Rais' body ended up in the Gomti river. It flows past Sultanpur, the city where the young man had been working as a chemist in December 1992 - the month when Hindu fundamentalists tore down the 16th Century Babri mosque in Ayodhya, Mr Shareef's home, 65km (40 miles) away.

Rais went missing amid the bloodshed which followed.

""After my son disappeared I searched for him everywhere for a month, like a mad man,"" his father says. ""I didn't find him anywhere. I even went to Sultanpur to look for him.""

Then came the news they had been dreading: their beloved son was dead. Mr Sharif and his wife Bibi were traumatised. His wife still struggles with periods of depression to this day.

The pain is aggravated by the fact they were not able to give their son a proper burial. It is a pain no one else should go through, Mr Shareef says.

""I decided that in my district, I wouldn't let any unidentified body be thrown away into a river,"" he says.

Image copyright Mohd Shabir Image caption Shareef says he takes care of the unknown dead persons as he would a family member

In India's caste-bound Hindu society, those who were at the bottom were historically forced to do the job of burial and cremations - and then treated as ""untouchables"" as a result.

But Mr Shareef - a bicycle mechanic by trade - was not to be deterred. He told the police about his desire to take up a task shunned by everyone else.

""When I got the first call, my heart was pounding. After the post-mortem, the police asked me to take away the body. I clearly remember that person's neck was slashed.""

Soon, his workload started to increase. He even bought a four-wheeled cart to transport the dead.

Predictably his family members, friends and neighbours were taken aback. Even as a Muslim, Mr Sharif began to experience the same social exclusion as his Hindu colleagues.

""No-one in my family was happy at that time. They said, 'you have gone mad'.

""Some people were afraid of me. They thought they would get infected with germs if they made physical contact with me.""

Yet Mr Shareef was resolute in his conviction. He had skipped family weddings, festivals and even prayers for the sake of unknown people. It gave him peace and solace: performing last rights is a moment to remember his son.

""It helped me to deal with the pain of my son's death. I think about him all the time. I miss him.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In the Hindu caste system, those who are relegated to the bottom of the pyramid are forced to assist with cremations and burials

It is not an easy job. Police often struggle to identify the body, which means they may have been dead for some time. Often it is not the bodies, Mr Shareef says, but the smell which is most off-putting.

""Whenever I see a badly mutilated or decomposed body it is difficult to sleep. I have nightmares and resort to sleeping tablets,"" he explains.

""Sometimes police officials come with me to the cemetery but even they stand far away.""

All the same, he always takes the time to ensure the person is given the proper treatment, usually bathing the body.

If he realises the dead person is Muslim, he wraps the body in a sheet of cloth and recites the final prayers. If the body belongs to a Hindu, he takes it to be cremated.

No-one know exactly how many bodies Mr Shareef has buried. The head of Ayodhya district administration, Anuj Kumar Jha, told the BBC that they don't have full records of the bodies handed over to Mr Shareef.

""Both Hindus and Muslims help me. People give me food and warm blankets. Recently I had to have an eye operation - a stranger called me and gave me 20,000 rupees [$290].""

But retirement is not something he is willing to consider. Neither his two surviving sons nor grandchildren want to follow in his footsteps, and he is acutely aware of what will happen if he stops doing this work.

""If I am not there, police will throw the bodies into rivers as they did before.""

For a man who some call the ""saviour of the dead"" that would be unbearable.

""I will continue doing this till my last breath,"" he says.

"['Jonathan Head', 'South East Asia Correspondent']","Image copyright Jonathan Head Image caption Tourists have deserted Thailand over coronavirus fears

Over the past 25 years, Thailand has experienced a spectacular economic crash (1997), a tsunami (2004), coups (2006, 2014), the occupation of its main international airport by protesters (2008) and serious political violence (2010).

Yet the statistics speak for themselves. In 1960 around 80,000 foreign tourists came here.

Last year it reached 39 million, earning more than $60bn (£46bn) for Thailand, and indirectly contributing around one fifth of the country's national income.

The country's tourism sector was considered so robust that the country got the nickname ""Teflon Thailand"". Yet of those 39 million tourists last year, more than 10 million were Chinese.

Image copyright Jonathan Head Image caption The streets of old Phuket Town are now as deserted as the empty beaches

So when the Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan on 23 January, and stopped all overseas tours, the impact was felt immediately in Thailand. Shopping malls and temples in Bangkok were suddenly much quieter and less crowded.

As more flights from China were cancelled, the airports emptied. You could whisk yourself through passport control in no time.

For small-scale entrepreneurs, the collapse of Chinese tourism has been disastrous.

Many of them, such as flower sellers, traditional dancers, and the drivers of the famous ""red cars"" minibuses in Chiang Mai, are reporting their income dropping by half over the past month. The informal association representing tour guides in Thailand thinks 25,000 people are now out of work.

Image caption Nattakit Lorwitworrawat's business is now struggling due to a lack of customers

One of the first successes of Thailand's 60-year-long tourist boom was the island of Phuket, nicknamed the ""Pearl of the Andaman"" for its soft white-sand beaches and sparkling warm seas.

The first foreign visitors in the 1980s and 1990s were mainly European and Australian, but the number of Chinese visitors last year shot up to about two million out of the 15 million foreigners.

The mangrove-lined inlets on the east side of the island, a contrast to the beaches facing the west, are where the boats leave from to take tourists out to the islands offshore. Like many of Phuket's residents, Nattakit Lorwitworrawat moved here from his home town elsewhere in Thailand to start a business.

His company now owns 30 speed boats, each able to carry 30 people. He has had to take 20 out of the water, and the remaining 10 are not getting much use. The inlet, normally constantly noisy from the sound of outboard motors, is now silent apart from the birds and the lapping water.

""At the peak two years ago we carried 1,000 clients a day. Today if we get 200 clients, that is considered very good - we would be very happy with that,"" says Nattakit.

He has bank loans to service on many of his boats. If the crisis goes on beyond the end of this year, he says he will have to downsize the company and start laying off his staff.

For those lower down the food chain it is even tougher.

Somkiat Prasarn has a mortgage on his little house, and loans on the van and car he bought to take Chinese tourists out on day trips around the island. He is supporting four children and an elderly mother.

His monthly payments on the loans, he said, are around $1,500 a month. Could he hold out for six months, I asked him? ""I cannot, sir,"" he says. Right now he is getting no custom at all apart from the occasional airport pickup.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Those tourists who are still are arriving in Thailand are being tested at the airports

""The government needs to help us and soon,"" says Sarayuth Mallam, vice-president of the Phuket Tourism Association. ""We don't ask for much. But if they want us not to lay off staff, they have to help us by cutting or delaying tax payments, social security payments, and giving soft loans to businesses here.""

Sarayuth also believes the powerful Tourism Authority of Thailand needs to start promoting Phuket aggressively in other markets outside China, like Russia, India and Australia. If they can control the virus in three months, he says, we can survive and come back.

But nobody knows how long this crisis will last, nor how serious it will become. For the moment there are still plenty of Europeans, Australians and Russians on the famous beaches, but for how long?

The authorities here have managed to control and monitor infections well considering how vulnerable it was from the number of Chinese people visiting before the restrictions on travel were implemented.

Yet the country has already been placed on some government lists of places to avoid because of coronavirus risk.

And people are booking holidays for later in the year, including the traditional high seasons of July-August and December-New Year in Thailand.

Families with children from Europe or Australia are likely to think twice before travelling so far. And Thailand is now imposing its own restrictions, requiring 14-day quarantine for visitors from some countries, a list that may well expand.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Streets and shopping centres in Bangkok are much quieter than usual

Who will risk booking a holiday in the sun if they end up spending it confined to their hotel room or a hospital?

With more flights being cancelled every week, the numbers of non-Chinese tourists are bound to fall steeply this year, however quickly the virus is brought under control.

The blow to this essential leg of Thailand's economy has come at a terrible time for the government. Already the other two main legs of the economy - manufacturing exports and agricultural commodities - are wobbling as higher wages and an overvalued local currency have been driving investors to cheaper neighbouring countries like Vietnam.

Growth in what was once one of South East Asia's ""tiger economies"" has been anaemic for several years, and may stall completely this year. The government, an unwieldy coalition controversially built around the same military leaders who led the last coup, is proving clumsy and unpopular.

It is an almost perfect storm, one that Thailand's present leaders look ill-equipped to weather.

Two sisters who had experienced ""honour hate"" in their community are to work to raise awareness of it in schools.

Amaleehah and Nadia Aslam-Forrester, from Bristol, were targeted by members of the Asian community for posting photos of themselves in skirts online.

The sisters, who have a Pakistani mother and English father, said they were ""slut-shamed"" for not upholding cultural norms of women's behaviour.

They are now working with a charity to educate young people about the issue.

So-called honour crimes are acts that have been committed to protect or defend the supposed honour or reputation of a family and extended community.

Amaleehah Aslam-Forrester, 22, said the pair had always been creative and would use Instagram to express their love of art, modelling and clothes.

However, they faced a backlash online for the photographs because of what they said were ""deeply ingrained cultural pressures"".

Their social media presence also alarmed their mother.

Worried about their safety, she put the sisters in touch with Integrate, a youth-led charity in Bristol which has campaigned for gender and racial equality and been supported by Sport Relief.

They attended a series of workshops with other young women about issues including female genital mutilation, sexism and honour-based violence and eventually made a film about the issue.

Amaleehah said: ""In our community, honour lies within the body of a woman.

"['Laura Bicker', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright AFP Image caption Daegu city has been worst affected by the coronavirus in South Korea

In a car park behind a hospital in Seoul, 45-year-old Rachel Kim rolls down her car window and sticks out her tongue. She travelled to Daegu last week, the area with the highest number of coronavirus cases in South Korea.

Now she's developed a bad cough and a fever. Fearing the worst, she decided to get a Covid-19 test at one of the dozens of drive-through centres. Two people dressed head-to-toe in white protective clothing, clear goggles and surgical face masks are ready for her.

A long swab stick is rummaged around the back of her mouth and throat and then placed carefully into a long test tube.

Then comes the tough bit. The swab goes right up her nose. She screws up her eyes in discomfort, but the whole thing is over in minutes. She rolls up her car window and off she drives. She will get a call if the result is positive, or a text if it's negative.

Negative pressure room

Nearly 20,000 people are being tested every day for coronavirus in South Korea, more people per capita than anywhere else in the world.

Rachel's sample is quickly shipped off to a nearby laboratory where staff are working 24 hours a day to process the results.

Image caption This drive-through test centre in Seoul is one of dozens across the country

In the battle to contain the contagion, these labs have become the front line. South Korea has created a network of 96 public and private laboratories to test for coronavirus.

Health officials believe this approach may be saving lives. The fatality rate for coronavirus in South Korea is 0.7%. Globally the World Health Organization has reported 3.4% - but scientists estimate that the death rate is lower because not all cases are reported.

I turned up at Green Cross laboratories just outside Seoul as a new batch of samples arrived to be tested. Dr Oh Yejin gave us a tour until she stopped at a door and made it clear we were not allowed through.

Ask me

""The tests are carried out in this negative pressure room,"" she told me. ""It prevents any droplets from the samples escaping.""

Inside, two doctors in bright yellow protective clothing are moving around the sealed room. They lift up a number of test tubes and get to work.

Beside us dozens of machines are whirring away and processing results. These are PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests - in very basic terms it is searching for the presence of Covid-19 in the sample.

The whole process from test tube to test result is about five to six hours.

Lessons from Mers

Professor Gye Cheol Kwon, the chairman of the Laboratory Medicine Foundation, calls this the Korean ""bali bali"" gene. Bali means quick in Korean. He says this because the South Koreans managed to design and create a test, set up a network of labs across the country and get it all to work in 17 days.

But this has come from bitter experience.

""We learned the risk of new infection and its ramifications from the experience of the Middle East Respiratory syndrome (Mers) back in 2015,"" he told me. Thirty-six people died in South Korea during the Mers outbreak.

It forced the country to reassess its approach to infectious diseases. South Korea's Centres for Disease Control even set up a special department to prepare for the worst. In this case, that preparation appears to have paid off.

""I think that early patient detection with accurate tests followed by isolation can lower the mortality rate and prevent the virus from spreading,"" said Prof Kwon. ""To learn from the past and prepare systems in advance… that might be the true power to overcome this new kind of disaster.""

It had been quite quiet for the team at Green Cross until early February when a patient - now known in South Korea as ""patient 31"" - with no known history of travel and no contact with previous cases tested positive for the virus.

She belonged to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect with over 200,000 members. It led to a race to find the source of the outbreak and trace everyone affected. South Korea's labs were put to the test. Fatigue among staff has been an issue. Now they work shifts and Dr Oh tells me, delightedly, that she is finally able to get some sleep.

Role model

There is no shortage of testing kits in South Korea. Four companies have been given approval to make them. It means the country has the capacity to test 140,000 samples a week.

Prof Kwon believes the accuracy of South Korea's Covid-19 test is around 98%. The ability to test so many people has made the country a role model as others look to battle their own coronavirus outbreaks.

But there have been missteps too.

At least two patients died waiting for a hospital bed in Daegu, the worst affected city. The initial reaction was to quarantine everyone infected with the virus in a hospital bed, but now the doctors have learned to treat those with mild symptoms in residential centres and leave the clinical beds for those needing critical care.

""We can't quarantine and treat all patients. Those who have mild symptoms should stay home and get treated,"" Dr Kim Yeon-Jae, an infectious disease specialist from the Korea National Medical Centre told me.

""We should change our end goal strategy to lower death rates. So other countries like Italy, that see huge numbers in patients, should also change their strategies as well.""

Wherever the virus hits in large numbers - makeshift test centres follow.

This week in Seoul, there was a mass infection at a call centre. Medics set up outside and quickly took swabs from hundreds of staff in the building.

Vaccine hope

The blood of recovered patients is also being monitored and analysed. Scientists have developed a ""unique"" protein that can detect antibodies - the hope is that it will help create a vaccine in the future.

One of the former patients undergoing weekly blood tests is Mr Lee. (He did not wish to give his first name). He was working in Wuhan, China in December when the virus struck the city. He was flown home by the South Korean government and tested positive for Covid-19 while in quarantine near Seoul.

Image caption Mr Lee was working in Wuhan and tested positive - but had only a mild case of the virus

His mum was upset.

""People around me were very worried,"" he said. ""I heard my mum cried every night.""

But she did not need to worry. The 28-year-old only had a mild case of the virus.

""I felt fine and almost had no symptoms. Just a little cough. Speaking from my own experience, it's really important to still be cautious and safe, but I wish people would have less fear of the virus itself.

""For me at least, the virus felt weaker than a regular cold. I know those who are older need to be careful. But for young people like me who are healthy, they shouldn't be too worried. Of course, it is important to take preventive measures though.""

'Better to know'

The preventative measures being taken in South Korea have so far involved no lockdowns, no roadblocks and no restriction on movement.

Trace, test and treat is the mantra. So far this country of over 50 million people have been doing their bit to help. Schools remain closed, offices are encouraging people to work from home, large gatherings have stopped.

However, slowly, day by day, more people are creeping back onto the streets of the capital city, Seoul. Restaurants, buses and subways are beginning to get busy again.

Dealing with the threat of coronavirus is the new normal. Most people wear masks (if they can get hold of one). There are thermal imaging cameras in the entrances to major buildings.

Bottles of hand sanitisers have been placed in lifts. There are even people dressed in costumes at subway entrances reminding you to wash your hands.

This may be the new normal for South Korea and elsewhere. But health officials are still on edge and warning there is no room for complacency. One large outbreak at a church, office, exercise class or apartment block can change everything.

And as for Rachel Kim, she got a text the day after her test. She doesn't have coronavirus. But she's glad she got tested.

""Better to know"", she said, ""and that way I am not a danger to others.""

,"Image caption This piece by Syed Mujtaba Rizvi shows how Kashmiris are being robbed of the ability to speak

A long shutdown in Indian-administered Kashmir has disrupted millions of people's lives. The BBC's Chinki Sinha speaks to artists about how their work has been affected.

""I will send you a photo of the key hanger I made when I go back,"" he said.

Malik Sajad, 33, a graphic novelist, was in the capital Delhi to use the internet in November, like many others from his home of Indian-administered Kashmir. But he never did send me the picture.

The region was under a partial internet ban for months, after having been subjected to the longest shutdown of any democracy.

Authorities had imposed a clampdown on Kashmir on 5 August 2019, after they revoked the Muslim-majority region's semi-autonomous status and split it into two federally-administered territories.

Landlines and mobile phone networks were also severely restricted for months before being gradually allowed to come back online.

The government said the measures - decried by many as draconian and excessive were necessary to prevent violent protests and maintain law and order.

But for many, they have brought about hopelessness and despair.

Image copyright Abid Bhat Image caption A landscape of Kashmir featuring the coils of barbed wire that are used to cordon off areas

Among those affected are a cohort of Kashmiri artists, who say they have long used their art as a medium of expression, resistance and resilience.

Mr Sajad, who has worked as a cartoonist for the Greater Kashmir newspaper since he was 15 and published a graphic novel about life in the region, says he began making a little cardboard helicopter for his three-and-half-year old nephew after the little boy was fascinated by drones flying in the sky above their home.

""That's art, too,"" he said.

He added that many artists were trying to record the difficulty of their everyday lives, as a response to the situation there.

Life in the region is not easy. One of the most militarised zones in the world, Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, which only control parts of it.

The two nuclear-armed rivals have already fought two wars and a limited conflict over it. A militant uprising in the nineties against Indian rule saw a revival after Indian forces shot dead a popular militant in 2016. Thousands of civilians participated in rallies against the government, which were violently dispersed by security forces.

Delhi-based Kashmiri origin performance artist Inder Salim is one of them. He says he has created jewellery out of the pellets that he says have caused such chaos among ordinary people in the region.

Indian forces have been criticised for their use of pump action shot guns that spray pellets to quell civilian protests. Although non-lethal, the weapons have caused hundreds of cases of full and partial blindness, including among children and babies.

Image caption Pellets are thought to have blinded hundreds in Kashmir

But Mr Salim, who is known for his provocative performance art, says his ""main work"" at the moment is a petition he has filed in the Supreme Court challenging the government move on Kashmir.

Other artists are responding in different ways.

Artist Masood Hussain (64), who has lived in the city of Srinagar for most of his life, says he has spent a lot of his time ""chronicling"" life in Kashmir, but that this time, things feel different.

""All my paintings before concluded with hope. This is the first time I have not concluded with hope but doom,"" he told the BBC over the phone from Srinagar.

His latest work, on canvas, is what he calls a ""response"" to this ""final betrayal"". It is a rendition of a black and white photo of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in conversation with Sheikh Abdullah, who held the title of Kashmir's prime minister, discussing Article 370 - the constitutional provision that guaranteed Kashmir its special status.

Many have called the revocation of this provision a ""betrayal"" of the basis on which the princely state of Kashmir became a part of India.

Image copyright Abid Bhat Image caption Artist Masood Hussain says this piece is his ""most despondent work"" to date

Artist Syed Mujtaba Rizvi says the lockdown adversely affected his work, he has spent long hours in his studio at home in Srinagar since the lockdown happened.

""I made absolutely nothing for at least the first 30 days. After that, I had to force myself into doing something, for the sake of my own sanity,"" he said.

His work ""Normalcy in the Shrine"" is a reference to the fact that many media outlets have been reporting that life is ""back to normal"" there.

It is a painting of one of the minarets of the historic Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, where people have been barred from praying - not just during the last three months of the lockdown, but quite often in the past decade.

His other painting- of a woman holding a dead child - is a continuation of a series that Rizvi started last year. It is called Redundant Conversations.

According to him, the creative process of art thrives in a conflict zone. However, he says it dies because there is no-one to see the work.

""No-one wants to show works by Kashmiri artists at the moment. Even the Srinagar Biennale is on hold for now,"" he said.

Scientists have discovered what they say is the smallest known dinosaur.

The new species has been described by one team member as the ""weirdest fossil"" she has ever worked on.

The specimen, from northern Myanmar, consists of a bird-like skull trapped in 99-million-year-old amber.

Writing in the prestigious journal Nature, researchers report that the dinosaur would have been similar in size to the bee hummingbird - the tiniest living bird.

The stunning find may shed light on how small birds evolved from dinosaurs - which were often bigger.

While the smallest dinosaurs, such as the bird-like Microraptor, weighed hundreds of grams, the bee hummingbird weighs just 2g.

""Animals that become very small have to deal with specific problems, like how to fit all sensory organs into a very small head, or how to maintain body heat,"" said Prof Jingmai O'Connor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.

Image copyright HAN Zhixin Image caption Artwork: Despite its tiny size, Oculudentavis appears to have been a predator

The new species, dubbed Oculudentavis khaungraae, appears to have dealt with these challenges in unusual ways.

For example, the animal's eye structure surprised the scientists.

Birds have a ring of bones, the scleral ring, that helps to support the eye. In most birds, the individual bones, called scleral ossicles, are simple and fairly square.

But in Oculudentavis, they are spoon-shaped, a characteristic previously only found in some living lizards.

The bones of the eye would have formed a cone, like the eye bones in owls. This indicates that the dinosaur had exceptional vision.

Unlike owls, the eyes faced sideways and the opening at the centre of the ossicles was narrow, which would have restricted the amount of light coming into the eye. This provides strong evidence that Oculudentavis was active in the daytime.

Image copyright LI Gang Image caption A CT scan of the skull of Oculudentavis

In addition, the creature's eyes would have bulged out of its head in a manner not seen in any other living animal, making it hard to understand exactly how the eyes functioned.

""It's the weirdest fossil I've ever been lucky enough to study,"" Prof O'Connor explained. ""I just love how natural selection ends up producing such bizarre forms. We are also super lucky this fossil survived to be discovered 99 million years later.""

Because the new specimen consists of only a skull, understanding how it is related to birds is unclear. Some features of the skull are like those of dinosaurs, while others are like those of very advanced birds.

The researchers say that the new specimen's remarkable suite of traits could have evolved either through the constraints of miniaturisation, or through becoming specialised to a particular lifestyle.

The dinosaur's jaw had a surprisingly large number of teeth. This would appear to suggest that, despite its tiny size, Oculudentavis was a predator that ate insects.

Image copyright HAN Zhixin Image caption Artwork: Oculudentavis had a surprisingly large number of teeth

Some soft tissue has also been preserved with the skull, notably the remains of the animal's tongue, which could yield further insights into its biology.

The find highlights the incredible potential of amber to preserve fossil specimens that might not otherwise have survived.

Co-author Dr Luis Chiappe, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, said: ""It's lucky this tiny creature was preserved in amber, as such small, fragile animals aren't common in the fossil record.

""This finding is exciting because it gives us a picture of the small animals that lived in a tropical forest during the age of dinosaurs.""

The geographical location of the find might have something to do with the process of miniaturisation, say the scientists.

Isolation is often involved in animals evolving smaller body size, with some notable examples occurring on islands.

Interestingly, the amber from Myanmar is thought to have formed on an ancient island arc.

,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Passengers arriving in Kenya on flights from China were being screened at the end of January

In our series of letters from African writers, Kenyan journalist Waihiga Mwaura reflects on how the coronavirus has fuelled anti-Chinese prejudice in his country.

Despite the concerns around the spread of the coronavirus, the greatest enemy is not the virus itself, but ""fears, rumours and stigma"".

Not my words, but those of the Ethiopian who is leading the global effort to lessen the impact of Covid-19.

The World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was responding at the end of last month to cases of anti-Chinese prejudice. He repeated the message on Twitter earlier this week while sharing a story about a Singaporean man who was beaten up in the UK capital, London, over the coronavirus.

The virus of prejudice is spreading. Kenya is no exception.

'You are coronavirus'

A shakily filmed video has been circulating on social media here showing an Asian man and woman being bullied by a large crowd in a low-income area of the capital, Nairobi.

The video begins with unidentified individuals in the crowd shouting: ""You are coronavirus, you are coronavirus.""

The man responds by trying to film the crowd but quickly realises that his female companion could be attacked so rushes to her aid.

He stands up to the most aggressive member of the crowd and starts shouting back: ""We don't have corona, we don't have corona.""

The video stops before we see how the incident ended but it was a true depiction of the side-effects of the coronavirus.

Citizen TV Before Kenya has even recorded a case, the fear, mixed with stigma, is palpable""

On 27 February, a message went viral on Facebook, allegedly posted by a Kenyan member of parliament, calling for his constituency residents to avoid interaction with Chinese nationals who had just returned from China after celebrating their new year.

The post warned that if the government did not do enough to protect its citizens, and forcefully quarantine any of these Chinese nationals, then the residents had his permission to chase away and stone any Chinese people within their vicinity.

China's embassy responded quickly with a Twitter post calling for a ""rational and scientific approach towards Chinese communities"" and described the remarks that had been made as racist.

Kenya is not alone in this prejudice, but what is interesting is that all the initial cases of the virus in sub-Saharan Africa have been linked to European travel rather than China. Yet there is no equivalent anti-European feeling.

Before Kenya has even recorded a case, the fear, mixed with stigma, is palpable.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some Kenyans have campaigned to stop flights coming in from China

The prejudice has been fuelled by China and Kenya's entwined economic relationship.

Kenya has borrowed a large amount of money from China for big infrastructure projects. While the ordinary Kenyan is not feeling the benefit, they are looking for someone to blame for their economic woes.

Tired of pointing the finger at the government, some here have re-directed their frustrations towards the growing number of Chinese nationals who have come to seek economic opportunities.

Coronavirus fears, therefore, have found fertile ground and led to some extraordinary behaviour.

Adrian Blomfield, a veteran freelance journalist here, said that all the drivers at his local taxi rank had agreed not to carry Chinese people as passengers.

One taxi driver told me that Chinese nationals were changing their user names on the taxi hailing apps to avoid their passenger request being declined.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kenya has now set up its first patient isolation centre

He also informed me that when they are ferrying passengers from the airport, they roll the windows down and even wear facemasks, especially if the passengers had just landed from China.

He wound up his narrative by demanding that the government provide free face masks to all taxi drivers who ply the airport route and to provide more information to the public.

There has been some criticism here that the authorities have been slow in educating the public about the virus and warning them against prejudice.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

The vacuum has been filled by rumours and misinformation. A sensitisation campaign has now been promised, but it may come too late.

Nevertheless, for Chinese nationals living in Kenya, like Lin Yimenghan, who runs a charity, life goes on.

He has witnessed only one worrying incident when someone called him ""coronavirus"" at a bus stop in Nairobi.

'Love and understanding'

But his analysis of the situation is remarkable.

""It is normal for people to fear something they are not aware of,"" he told me calmly.

The spread of the stigma is faster than the spread of the virus, he added, and ended with some advice: ""People should have more understanding and love for each other.""

If only everyone had such an attitude, then this world would be a more peaceful place.

Driven by the goal of making visiting North Korea affordable, the company had a big impact on tourism to the North.

Mr Collings, who was from New Zealand, died last week, the company said.

""Troy was instrumental in establishing Young Pioneer Tours as one of the leading travel companies for North Korea,"" the firm said in a statement.

""We here at YPT have lost a visionary and a true pioneer to the travelling industry.

""Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know or to be led on a tour by Troy have lost a dear friend.""

Mr Collings co-founded the company with Gareth Johnson in 2008.

In an interview in 2018, he said his interest in the country was spurred by the 2004 documentary on North Korean gymnastics, A State of Mind.

During a subsequent trip, he realised ""the potential tourism had to help the locals and to influence the country's development"".

""More importantly, I made some real human connections with people I met that had a profound effect on me,"" he said.

""I decided during that trip that this is what I wanted to dedicate my life to.""

Together with Mr Johnson - to whom he credited the idea - he began building a travel business to take groups to North Korea, at around half the cost of what other tour organisers were asking.

""The hurdles were less than most people would expect, but that was mostly due to good relations, with good partners we had formed in Pyongyang over our visits,"" he said.

The agency's packages range from visiting the capital, to the Pyongyang Marathon, to tours through the countryside.

""If it were not for the budget pricing model which YPT pioneered then many young people would never have had the chance to visit the DPRK,"" Chad O'Carroll, managing director of North Korea specialist website NK News told the BBC.

""These are tours which in some cases - such as my own - played a major role in catalyzing a long-term interest in focusing on the country.""

All trips to North Korea receive close scrutiny from the North - groups are accompanied by a North Korean guide and it's not possible to choose your own itinerary.

The company was thrust into the spotlight in 2016 after one of its customers, Otto Warmbier, was arrested in Pyongyang for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda sign and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was returned to the US in a coma in June and died a week later.

Today, the company also offers other tours off the beaten track, including Chernobyl in Ukraine or East Timor in Asia.

In 2018, Mr Collings said he'd ""learnt a lot - but the biggest lessons have probably been to examine my own biases and view everything with a critical eye"".

""People talk all the time about North Korean propaganda, but it's naive to think we aren't inundated with our own. Things aren't black and white and agendas are everywhere.

""Don't just form opinions based off the last book or article you read or speaker you saw but reserve judgement until you really have an understanding of a situation.""

While tourism to North Korea remains niche, it has brought a steady flow of revenue to the country.

Numbers are hard to get and not reliable, but it's thought that around 100,000 foreigners visit the country each year.

The vast majority are Chinese - the number of non-Chinese tourists is estimated to be between 8,000 and 10,000 per year.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-51732244,BBC,Asia,TRUE

At least one of the stars said they were using the mask to make a statement rather than to prevent the spread of the virus.

A routine question from her doctor about menstruation set Kenyan Julian Peter, now 29, down a path that led her to discover she was born without a womb, cervix or a vagina. Twelve years on she shared her story with the BBC's Anne Ngugi.

I was born with a condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), where you have no womb or vagina, and you can also find yourself with just one kidney.

A woman who has MRKH can never get periods.

I don't have a uterus, so I've never had periods. This is the normal that I know, I don't feel bad about it.

People have different feelings about who I am.

'They can say whatever they want'

Someone told me that I should go somewhere to be prayed for.

Another person said that because I come from Ukambani [a region that is stereotypically linked to witchcraft] then my grandmother had something to do with this.

They can say whatever they want to but what really matters is how I take it. If I were to listen to them it would start affecting me, and I would start thinking that what they were saying was true.

I discovered I had the syndrome when I was a 17-year-old school student.

I went to hospital as I had problem with my legs, which were swollen. The first thing the doctor asked me was when I last had my period. I had never had one.

Julian Peter I cried on the first day and the second day and the third, but then I moved on... my priority was to get back to school""

They did a scan. The first image indicated that my reproductive tract was closed from the outside.

I went through an operation to open it, which was not successful.

I had another scan that showed I had no uterus or vagina, and that was when I was diagnosed with MRKH.

I cried on the first day and the second day and the third, but then I moved on. I was only 17 and quite small, so my priority was to get back to school.

I was in hospital with my mother, my only parent, and the diagnosis shocked her. I think as a parent there were questions she was bound to ask herself, Essentially she was wondering if she had done something wrong.

'I didn't want the operation'

As I had studied biology, I understood what the doctor was saying that first time.

I told her that I didn't want to go through with an operation at that point as I wanted to go back to school to complete my education.

Ten years later, I went back to hospital and had a successful operation.

The type of MRKH that I had meant that I had no vagina, no womb and I only have one kidney. My vaginal canal was not there and it had to be created.

My life is normal as MRKH does not interfere with how I want to live. But for some it is emotionally disturbing and people might need to go to a psychologist to accept the condition.

When you realise the implications of the condition that you have, you have to forget about giving birth to children.

Getty Images MRKH syndrome Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Characterised by absence of the vagina, cervix and the uterus

Affects one in 5,000 women

Type 1 refers to the absence of reproductive organs

Type 2 refers to the absence of, or abnormality with, a kidney

Usually discoveredduring puberty when menstruation does not start Source: NHS

I have had four scans and no ovaries were found, so even retrieving eggs for IVF cannot be done.

You must accept the way you are. But realising that you are not like other women is difficult, you need someone who you can talk to.

I've met many people here in Kenya with the condition and we share our experiences. I accepted my condition early on and I have accepted myself, so I'm OK.

Explaining to a partner

I have been in relationships. But I don't let things go too far before sitting down with them and letting them know about my condition.

If they want to accept it they will accept it. But you know, human beings are just human beings.

A large percentage of the people I have told have gone away. Others accuse me of lying, they think that I am saying it to chase them away.

Right now I'm not in a relationship, but it's all God's doing.

When it comes to having sex, I had the surgery to reconstruct the vaginal canal in 2018, so it's just over a year after and I am not ready to have sex.

Neither am I ready to get married. If we wanted to have children we could adopt.

It took me at least 10 years to decide to share my story with the public.

There are people who do not understand what MRKH is and I want to raise awareness.

Image copyright Julian Peter Image caption Julian Peter has a support group where people listen and help each other

First of all, I'm advising parents who have babies with such a condition not to accept the operation when your child is young.

Let it happen after they are grown up, when they can understand, because the procedure is complicated and long.

Advice to parents

It's painful and the child may not understand what's happening.

As a parent, also do your research, so that when your daughter gets to know about the condition, you are ready to help to fight the stigma they will face.

I have a support group and I have heard from people with all sorts of challenges.

There are those who are married, and their in-laws are making demands for children. There is one woman who has been told by her in-laws that she is a man.

So we listen and encourage. What is important is to help each other because this journey can be difficult.

The coronavirus outbreak is no longer a threat for Africa, it is now a reality as more and more countries on the continent have cases.

East Africa is the last region to confirm infections: Sudan confirmed that a 50-year-old man has died, while Ethiopia says a Japanese man who recently travelled to the country tested positive to Covid-19.

News on Friday that a Kenyan woman, who travelled from the US via London, had the virus sparked panic buying in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.

Pictures and videos shared on social media showed shoppers filling up baskets with hand sanitiser, soap and food.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Liquid soap is selling fast in Nairobi

The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that the window of opportunity to prepare is closing and that critical gaps remain.

""Every country can still change the course of this pandemic by scaling up their emergency preparedness or response,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa.

The inter-governmental organisation says it has now shifted from ""readiness"" to ""response"" mode on the continent.

Experts baffled

Most of the confirmed cases involve people arriving from Europe and North America.

More on Africa and the virus:

The WHO said while local transmission - that is people with no travel history - remains low, containment is the most appropriate strategy.

That means detecting cases quickly, isolating them to minimise transmission, treating them and tracing their contacts.

Yet the relatively low numbers in Africa have baffled experts.

Some suggest the tropical climate is less favourable to the new virus.

John Nkengasong, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Prevention and Control, says no data is available to support that theory.

""But we know that Covid-19 is part of the coronavirus family to which the common cold belongs,"" he told the BBC.

These better-known coronaviruses are less prevalent where temperatures are higher.

But Dr Nkengasong hastens to point out that there are significant outbreaks of Covid-19 in countries in the tropics, like Thailand.

If the virus follows the pattern of other viruses, with seasonal peaks in winter, this will be a source of concern for southern Africa, which is heading into its colder months and ""flu season"", Dr Moeti told the BBC.

One thing that put Africa a step ahead of the rest of the world was its early screening at airports and other ports of entry.

This is because infrastructure was already in place and health workers at hand because of the outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which now appears to be coming to an end.

DR Congo's first confirmed case of coronavirus was detected this way.

AFP It's possible that with a predominantly young population, Africa may be spared widespread severe cases""

But most symptoms tend to develop days after arrival, like Nigeria's first patient: the Italian was asymptomatic when he arrived in Lagos. He even travelled to Ogun state before falling ill. His contacts were traced and one of them tested positive for the virus.

The continent has also had time to observe what other countries are doing to combat the new virus and prepare.

During the current pandemic, it been noted that some asymptomatic cases have been infectious.

This is something South Africa's health ministry has taken on board - identifying such cases and advising them to self-quarantine while those with symptoms are treated.

So far, countries with confirmed cases appear to be managing them.

Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia have reported clusters of local transmission.

Widespread person-to-person transmission is what health experts fear most in Africa, as that could quickly overwhelm the health systems.

Across the world, there is a strong correlation between age and severity of the Covid 19 infection.

Older people with pre-existing conditions are more vulnerable.

""It's possible that with a predominantly young population, Africa may be spared widespread severe cases,"" says Dr Nkengasong, as the continent has the world's youngest population.

HIV and Africa's 'big three'

But concerns have been raised about suppressed immunity, particularly among people living with HIV.

HIV eventually wipes out the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to other infections, what is known as acquired human immunodeficiency syndrome (Aids).

More than 32 million people have died from Aids-related illnesses since it was identified in the early 1980s, according to UNAids.

Nearly 38 million are living with the virus, and the vast majority of them are in Africa.

""It's important to underline that there is currently no strong evidence that people living with HIV are at an especially increased risk of contracting Covid-19 or, that if they do contract it, they will experience a worse outcome,"" says head of UNAids Winnie Byanyima.

She notes that there is anxiety among people living with HIV and urges them to take all necessary preventive measures just like the rest of the population.

However she cautions that those with HIV should not be forgotten as countries focus on fighting Covid-19.

A study by UNAids found that when the coronavirus outbreak began in China, people in affected areas living with HIV found it difficult to get hold of their anti-retroviral medicines.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Last year, the WHO reported that 94% of malaria deaths occurred in Africa

She also called for more research into the ""biological and immunological interactions"" between HIV and the new coronavirus.

For Dr Nkengasong co-infection is one of the greatest concerns.

""Not just with HIV but with tuberculosis and malaria as well,"" he said.

The hope now is that as countries focus their resources on controlling Covid-19, the three infections that are among the biggest killers on the continent are not forgotten.

Any lapses in treating Africa's ""big three"" could lead to more deaths.

It is no doubt going to be a major test for countries and their management of available resources.

And unlike with the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, this coronavirus outbreak is a pandemic.

A South African king, a nephew of the late Nelson Mandela, has been arrested after allegedly going on the rampage with an axe in the palace.

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, freed from jail on parole in December, broke into the Thembu royal palace in the early hours.

Witnesses said he was searching for his son, the regent, who was appointed the acting monarch while he was in prison.

The regent escaped through a window, but his wife has been injured and taken to hospital, a royal spokesman said.

King Dalindyebo was sentenced to 12 years in jail for kidnapping, assault and arson, but only served four years after the president granted some prisoners early parole last year.

He was the first monarch to be convicted of a crime in South Africa since white-minority rule ended in 1994.

The 56-year-old comes from the Thembu clan, to which Mr Mandela, South Africa's first black president, belonged.

South Africa has seven officially recognised monarchs representing different ethnic groups and clans.

'People were running for their lives'

Since King Dalindyebo's release from jail, there have been tensions in the Thembu royal family and he has refused to see his son, acting King Azenathi Zanelizwe Dalindyebo.

Last month, the royal household decided that Azenathi should continue on as regent for at least another year, South Africa's City Press paper reported.

Image copyright AFP Image caption King Dalindyebo, seen here flanked by his chiefs in 2013, has always been a maverick

Royal spokesman Prince Siganyeko Dalindyebo said the king had broken into the palace - Bumbane Great Place, just outside the town of Mthatha in Eastern Cape Province - at around 03:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning.

""He was carrying weapons such as [an] axe, a machete and also a crowbar. He managed to break a window from the sitting room of the main house,"" he told public broadcaster SABC.

""As he was moving up the stairs looking for the acting king, some people managed to distract him and then the acting king managed to jump out of a window, running for safety.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Traditional rulers and chiefs continue to enjoy widespread respect in South Africa

Other people were also running for their lives, the prince said.

""He has wreaked havoc in the palace… he started ransacking the king's room, all confidential documents - he threw them around.""

Video footage shows the troubled monarch later standing outside his palace, calmly smoking a cigarette, and daring the police to arrest him, which they eventually did.

The king was jailed in 2015 after being convicted of assaulting his subjects during a ""reign of terror"" in the 1990s.

He had kidnapped a woman and her six children, set their home on fire and beaten up four youths, one of whom died, because one of their relatives had failed to present himself before the king's traditional court.

Will this spell the end for South African royals?

Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo is, to put it mildly, a maverick royal.

If his behaviour has often proved extreme, it nonetheless poses some fundamental questions about the role of traditional leaders in modern, post-apartheid South Africa: their entitlements, public funding, the feudal nature of their control and, above all in this case, the extent to which their royal titles grant them impunity.

As well as the formally recognised monarchs, South Africa has thousands of other traditional leaders - headmen and chiefs - who continue to enjoy widespread respect, particularly in rural areas, and who are often called to mediate in civil disputes within their clans.

During the decades of racial apartheid, the white-minority government sought to strengthen the role of royal families, seeking to play them off against the broader and much more threatening liberation movement led by the African National Congress (ANC).

Image copyright AFP Image caption Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is the most influential of South Africa's traditional rulers

But in recent years - and after multiple royal scandals - some South Africans have begun to question the sustainability of the traditional system, not least when it comes to issues like the semi-feudal control that Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini still enjoys over vast areas of land that he rents out to his subjects.

King Zwelithini - whose outspoken views on immigrants and sex education along with his lavish lifestyle have often been criticised - has, like King Dalindyebo, repeatedly challenged the authority of South Africa's democratic government.

The country's royal families face no immediate challenge to their authority, and many South Africans may shrug off King Dalindyebo as an embarrassing outlier.

The EU says it will pay €2,000 (£1,770; $2,225) each to migrants in overcrowded camps on the Greek islands willing to go back to their home countries.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson announced the scheme in Athens on Thursday. It was agreed with the Greek government.

She said 5,000 migrants would be eligible for the ""voluntary return"".

Many of the migrants are Syrians fleeing the civil war, but there are also Afghans, Pakistanis and West Africans. It is not clear how many would qualify for refugee status.

Aid agencies consider Syria too dangerous for migrants to be sent back there, but some other countries of origin, such as Pakistan, are considered safe enough.

Greece has temporarily suspended its processing of new asylum applications - a move condemned by aid groups.

Oxfam's spokesman on EU migration, Florian Oel, said ""all EU governments have avoided taking responsibility, not just Greece"" over the migrant crisis.

He said the situation had remained very bad since 2016, when Turkey signed a deal with the EU to halt a much larger flow of migrants into Europe.

The latest surge in numbers at the Greek border came after Turkey announced that it would no longer stop them trying to enter Greece. Turkey, which is hosting 3.7 million Syrian refugees already, accuses the EU of not doing enough to help.

""People in need of safety have been turned into political bargaining chips,"" Mr Oel told the BBC.

""The EU partners have to share responsibility for those arriving; it means states should relocate refugees to their own countries and do the asylum procedure there. They must agree on permanent rules.""

However, he welcomed the EU announcement on relocating unaccompanied children as ""a good first step"".

Ms Johansson said repatriation of migrants from the islands would be coordinated with the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the EU border force Frontex.

,"Odion Ighalo has scored four goals in three starts for Manchester United

Odion Ighalo's sensational goal for Manchester United in their 5-0 thrashing of LASK in the Europa League was worthy of a packed house at the Linzer Stadion.

Juggling the ball from right foot to left, the 30-year-old Nigeria forward then cannoned a left-footed shot in off the crossbar from 18 yards.

But instead of the roar of a crowd, all that was audible was was a thud of boot to ball and the clang of the crossbar before he was joined by his team-mates.

It was a sparkling effort unfortunately witnessed live by a smattering of people and not the wider audience it deserved due to the coronavirus outbreak restricting the attendance to just 500.

United's substitutes even crowded around a screen in their dugout to watch it again. But then would Ighalo have even attempted it at Old Trafford?

Former United midfielder Paul Ince, suggested otherwise on BT Sport, likening it to the sort of potshot seen at training grounds when the pressure is off.

""Maybe he doesn't do it in front of a full house,"" said Ince. ""It reminds me of one of those that you do at training. Maybe I'm doing a disservice to him.""

However, fellow studio guest Owen Hargreaves, was a touch more complimentary.

""It is like Tony Yeboah, it's a thing of beauty,"" he said, referencing the Ghanaian's famous in-off-the-crossbar volley for Leeds in 1995.

""It is one of the best goals he has ever scored.""

'No-one would have saved that'

United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also effusive in his praise of Ighalo, who was a surprise January addition on loan from China's Shanghai Shenhua.

""Odion has done really well when he's come in and he's enjoying himself,"" Solskjaer said.

""He will improve and get better, but he has qualities that we saw in him that we needed and we'll still need those qualities for next season so let's see what we do.

""He is very good back to goal, you can play up to him. Great link player, but maybe the best thing about him is his personality, so he's got the whole lot really.

""He had three touches before his fourth, the finish. All them touches were high quality but he had to make them to create the space for himself.

""But the strike is on the half-volley, great timing. No-one would have saved that one so anyone would be proud of that finish.""

What fans made of it all

Paul Murphy: Remember when we all laughed when United signed Ighalo?

Michal Koziol: Everyone who said Ighalo wasn't the calibre United need should look at that goal over and over again. The first touch, the control, the power, everything perfect. Such a shame the stadium's empty.

Nicholas Mills: Anything about this Ighalo loan spell reminding anyone of Henrik Larsson.

Stuart Mitchell: That goal deserved to be seen by many more people in the ground. Stunning strike and United would do well to sign him up for next season clear he wants to play for the club.

Altaf Shaikh: Had my reservations about Ighalo, but what a start he has had, top goal, just what United needed.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51865144,BBC,Africa,TRUE
,"Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption Soldiers have taken over key installations in the capital

For a day recently, the small West African country of Guinea-Bissau had two presidents and two prime ministers, until one of the presidents stepped down citing death threats.

The country has been gripped by political turmoil for so many years that analysts do not agree on exactly how many coups it has had in its 46 years of independence. Some say nine, others count 10. An election held last year was another attempt to carve a new peaceful path but it has sparked yet more chaos, as journalist Ricci Shryock reports.

Amidst the political chaos, daily life appears to be carrying on as normal in the capital, Bissau, but underneath the veneer, residents say they are deeply frustrated with the political chaos and confused about what will happen next and whom to believe.

While the Portuguese word ""saudades"" expresses a longing for the past, the feeling in Bissau is more akin to a longing for a more prosperous future they know is possible, but each time Bissau-Guineans' raise their hopes, they are dashed by political manoeuvring - often backed by guns.

Along the streets, women are selling the country's number-one cash crop - freshly harvested cashews.

But the presence of armed soldiers is a reminder that things are not normal.

The absence of trusted sources of news has provided good fodder for rumours and innuendo, with people constantly trying to parse what is true and what is not.

Contradictory official communiqués and letters from various sides, about who is the rightful president, are being shared on WhatsApp and Facebook in the country of 1.6 million people.

""We don't know what's going on,"" said a hotel manager, Aboubacar, as he scrolled through his Facebook feed. He furrowed his brow and frowned as he tried to decide which local blogs to read.

One restaurant owner, who said the chaos was hurting her business, added: ""For such a tiny country, it's amazing how much fake news we can produce.""

Umaro Cissoko Embaló was announced as the winner of December's election.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Umaro Sissoco Embaló has won two legal challenges and hopes to win a third

The long-time ruling party PAIGC however alleged it was cheated out of victory and insists that Mr Embaló waits for the Supreme Court to rule on its third request to annul the elections. But he refused and has taken the oath of office.

And in the meantime, PAIGC lawmakers, who say that an alliance with smaller parties means they still have a majority in parliament, swore in one of its members as president and insisted their current prime minister stay in office.

However, shortly afterwards PAIGC Cipriano Cassamá stood down, citing fears for his safety.

Fake news fills the vacuum

""The problems in Bissau are structural problems, and the country has never really stabilised politically,"" said Gilles Yabi, founder of West African think-tank, Wathi.

""The country has the history of war, fighting for independence from Portugal, so the presence of the military is directly linked to this history, and the role the military played to get independence.""

Image copyright Ricci Shryock Image caption An uneasy calm has engulfed the streets of Bissau

He added there were other factors at play in the current crisis.

""The main problem is the political class of the country, and the fact that they have been fighting for power for a long time. The current situation is very polarised. Depending on whom you talk to, they will have quite a different version of things.""

There are two competing versions at the moment: While the PAIGC says the elections was rigged, the opposing side, MADEM-G15, says its candidate Mr Embaló won December's polls and is now rightfully installed at the presidency.

Image copyright Dan Sanha Image caption Cipriano Cassamá was speaker of parliament until he briefly became president

The National Election Commission has repeatedly confirmed that Mr Embaló won the polls with 54% of the vote, and at least one minister in his government has publicly accused their opponents of bribing a Supreme Court judge to rule in PAIGC's favour and stall the confirmation of Mr Embaló's win.

Both sides say they have proof, but in the vacuum of that proof, residents' social media feeds are flooded with false news reports of weapons seizures at a political party's headquarters and politicians hiding out at foreign embassies - events that never happened.

Bissau and the cocaine trade

To add to the confusion, Guinea-Bissau has for many years been used as a staging post in the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America to Europe.

The PAIGC's Aristides Gomes, who still says he is the rightful prime minister, has claimed that narco-trafficking is the main factor behind the current political instability.

A brief history of Guinea-Bissau:

Image copyright AFP

1446-47: First Portuguese arrive; subsequently administered as part of the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, the Guinea area becomes important in the slave-trade. Guinea-Bissau becomes a separate colony in the Portuguese Empire in 1879.

1974: Independence following a guerrilla war.

1980: Country's first president, Luís Cabral, is ousted in military coup led by João Bernardo Vieira; plans for unification with Cape Verde dropped. The overthrow is the first of many political coups that undermine the country's stability over the next four decades.

2010: US names two top military officials as international drugs traffickers and freezes their US assets. EU announces it is ending mission to reform Guinea-Bissau's security forces, saying lack of respect for rule of law is making this an impossible task.

2011: EU suspends part of its aid to Guinea-Bissau because of concerns over governance and the rule of law. Several months later, thousands take to the streets to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior for his failure to curb rising food prices.

2012: The UN Security Council expresses concern that drug trafficking has increased, and demands a return to constitutional rule.

2020: Umaro Cissoko Embaló takes office

Experts say drug traffickers can profit from the current political chaos, and there were already reports that one notorious trafficker who had previously fled the country was spotted back in Bissau at a downtown hotel last week.

This report was denied by Ibrahima Jalo, an ally of Mr Embaló, who heads the association of 18 political parties which is not represented in the assembly.

""No, no, no… Drug trafficking? In this country? No. Please. The drug trafficking here in Guinea-Bissau was maybe happening before, but it will never happen again.""

Image copyright AFP Image caption Vultures are often seen as a portend of death in the region

In the past, the military and navy have been heavily linked to the country's drug trade.

In 2013, US Drug Enforcement Administration arrested the former head of the navy as he was attempting to close a million-dollar cocaine deal going through Guinea-Bissau.

Trafficking reportedly dropped off in Guinea-Bissau after that, but some experts say the recent few years of political crisis have reopened the corridor.

Amidst the chaos, nearly 1,000 hooded vultures were killed in a mass poisoning in the east of the country. Some said it was a bad omen for the country.

The birds were bubbling from their beaks in what the Vulture Conservation Foundation says is the worst mass vulture death event in recent memory in the world.

Fighting in the courts, not with guns

Vincent Foucher, a researcher for the French National Centre for Scientific Research, stresses that the latest iteration of the crisis appears at least for now to be more peaceful than some in the past.

""I think it's quite important to note that the elites have realised that now the competition is fought with and around legal norms. It's not about killing people - well for now - or coups. Let's hope it stays that way,"" he said.

However, all parties insist the law is on their side.

""It's always this thing that in Bissau people bend the law in one sense or another as suits their interests in the position of the moment. The law is bendable and it's not strong enough, not written clearly enough to an extent, and that's part of the problem even though it's not the cause of the problem,"" Mr Foucher added.

Foreign involvement is also complicating the situation.

Senegalese President Macky Sall has been outspoken in his support of Mr Embaló's presidency and his Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Regional troops have been in Guinea-Bissau for years to prevent conflict

The PAIGC has, however, denounced Senegal for what it says is interference in Guinea-Bissau's internal politics and that it wants to control the country's development - or lack thereof - especially when it comes to contentious maritime rights along their shared border.

Regional body Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) has said Mr Embaló's inauguration was outside the legal framework. A claim Mr Embaló's supporters rejected.

Still dreaming of a better future

Meanwhile, young people in the country lament that the political crisis in the country has lasted their entire lives.

Teachers and healthcare workers have been on strike since late last year, and many in the capital express a desire for the international community to intervene.

The UN Security Council also late last week urged security and defence forces not to interfere with the post-electoral political crisis.

,"Marrakesh staged Africa's annual E-Prix race on 29 February

Electric motorsport series Formula E is seeking to expand its operations in Africa, the sport's founder Alejandro Agag has told the BBC.

The series currently has just one race in Africa - with Morocco's Marrakesh hosting one of the season's 14 rounds - but this could be two within the next ""12-24 months"".

The championship has not featured an African driver since it started in 2014, but there are also plans to change this.

""One of the locations we're talking to is Cape Town,"" Agag told BBC Sport Africa.

""We have some people there working to see if we can make it happen. There's a great location there around the football stadium, so that would be one of the options we're looking at.""

Marrakesh has staged a race since the 2016, the third season of a championship which started in 2014, and the sport is keen to expand further.

""Africa is a key continent where growth is happening and is going to happen,"" said Allan McNish, the team principal of Audi Sport.

""For the moment, Marrakesh is our home in Africa but we are actively looking for other cities, which doesn't mean we'll stop doing Marrakesh.

""We could do two cities in Africa - and that's a priority for us. I would suggest in the next 12-24 months, you're going to be going to a lot more races on the continent.""

Formula E organisers are considering a race near to Cape Town's Green Point Stadium

African Driver

While Formula E is looking to expand the number of races in Africa, officials also say they are ""actively looking"" to find the first African driver in the series.

None of the 12 teams, who have two drivers apiece, competing this year have one, nor have had one in the past.

""I think having a local hero on the track is very important to attract fans and to really have a connection with the fans,"" Spaniard Agag added.

""So we will need African drivers to be good and to be competitive. [If they could] be up there fighting for victory, that would be fantastic.

""Of course we're looking - for the moment, we don't have one - but definitely it would be fantastic to have one and we're actively looking.""

Formula E founder Alejandro Agag says an African driver is being 'actively' sought

South Africa's Kelvin van der Linder is one driver harbouring dreams of competing in Formula E.

In Marrakesh on 1 March, the 23-year-old competed in the Formula E rookie test, which took place a day after the E-Prix.

The rookie test is an introduction to Formula E cars for drivers who have never contested an E-Prix and who do not hold a licence to compete in the sport.

""The dream for me is to get to the top level of motorsport and right now, that's Formula 1 or Formula E,"" Van der Linder told BBC Sport Africa.

""There's not many in the world that get the chance, especially at a high level such as Formula E.

""What I'm trying to do is be the face of it and show that it is possible because as a continent, especially as a country in South Africa, we're typically underestimated - we have lot of talent but we just don't have the opportunity to get to show it.""

South Africa is the country that provided the last African driver in Formula 1, with Jody Scheckter - who quit the sport in 1980 - having won the title itself in 1979.

The last Formula 1 race to be held in Africa was also South Africa-based, with the Kyalami track staging the 1993 Grand Prix.

Kyalami is located just north of Johannesburg, where a Formula 1 festival is scheduled to take place at the end of the month.

""Formula 1 is very committed to the African market and South Africa - and putting every effort in possible to try to bring F1 back to the continent and South Africa,"" said Warren Scheckter, the CEO of South African Grand Prix.

""So this F1 festival is part of those efforts. There's still a lot of work to be done to actually secure an F1 return to South Africa from a racing standpoint, but the F1 festival is laying that groundwork.

,"David Rudisha, pictured in December 2018, attending an event known as the 'Maasai Olympics' at Kimana, near Kenya's border with Tanzania

Snoozing in Nairobi airport's departure lounge in a navy blue suit, David Rudisha looks like just another businessman having a quick power nap.

His fellow passengers seem pretty relaxed about being in the presence of Kenyan running royalty. My feelings are a little different.

Appropriately for a man who has hardly been seen or heard from in the past three years, the two-time Olympic 800m champion Rudisha has been difficult to track down.

But now here we are, finally face to face with the man who, for some, outshone Usain Bolt at London 2012. It's a fuller face than you might remember.

By his own admission, the 31-year-old has changed a lot since that incredible world record of one minute 40.91 seconds he set in winning Olympic gold, before defending his crown four years later in Rio.

The initial problem was injury. A long-term issue with the tendon that attaches to the sitting bone means he has not run competitively since 4 July 2017.

But Rudisha has had to cope with a lot more than that.

Marital problems, separating from his wife, plus the death of his father Daniel - himself an Olympic medallist - last year left Rudisha looking for ""a bit of destruction to distract"".

To release the pressure valve, he was ""partying too much"". When the injuries finally subsided and he was able to return to running in November, he did so two stone overweight.

And then there is the reason why Rudisha feels he is living a ""second chance"" at life. He could easily have died last summer.

Five hours into a six-hour drive to his family home in Kilgoris, south-west Kenya, Rudisha rounded a corner late at night to be confronted by a bus on his side of the road. They collided head-on.

His car was a write-off. Recalling the memory, he recoils in his seat.

""Actually I don't even have words to explain the accident,"" he says. ""It was really horrific and scary. It was not easy and everybody, every time, kept asking me: 'How did you even survive? How did you get out of that car?'

""To come out without a single scratch was just like a miracle. It is not something that happens every day, it was so special and I feel like God still loves me.""

All of this explains why reducing weight, rather than lap times, is still top of the to-do list. However, a big goal is back on the table: the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Rudisha is one of four men to win consecutive 800m Olympic titles. Nobody has won three - at all, let alone in a row.

""I still feel like I still have something in me. I have not exhausted everything,"" he says.

""There is something left in the tank and that is what I want to exhaust before I think of doing other things.

""If you saw me one month ago I was a little bit heavier, but now I am losing the weight and the response is pretty good. The routine is back. When you miss out on training and competition for two years it is never easy…""

Rudisha trails off. The question of what could happen if the old magic returns is left hanging.

It's a tantalising thought. This is the man who after all, according to chairman Lord Coe, delivered the best performance of the entire London 2012 Olympics.

""Bolt was good, Rudisha was magnificent,"" Coe said. ""That is quite a big call but it was the most extraordinary piece of running I have probably ever seen.

""He had the balls to go in there and think: 'I am so much better than anyone else that I could [run a world record].' In Olympic finals you are not supposed to gamble with the till, but he did.""

Rudisha circa 2020 is more circumspect.

The impact of three years of back-to-back injuries undoubtedly informs his current mantra, for which he dips into Swahili: ""Pole, pole (slowly, slowly).

""I have had so many setbacks before so I don't want to rush into anything.

""We are human beings, not machines. You cannot have a spare part of your leg or foot or whatever, but we have also to listen sometimes to our body.

""Don't push, just try to be disciplined, doing the right thing at the right time. If the body responds and says yes…""

In an interview with Spikes magazine in October, Rudisha was open about turning to partying as a way to release the pressure he felt from his on and off-track issues.

""With everything else going on in my life, the pressure sometimes got to me,"" he said.

Rudisha's victory in the 800m was one of London 2012's iconic moments

""To release it I'd often hang out with friends, partying too much. It's not something you intend to come your way but sometimes, during periods like that, you look for a bit of destruction to distract yourself.""

Four months later he's a little more defensive.

""Well, I, you know, I have never really directly spoken about partying but, you know, just a social life that everybody has the right to enjoy,"" is how he explains it now.

""Whenever we have a [athletics] meet, sometimes we go to socialise, to go out for instance. That is normal life.

""I never meant anything extreme, because that is not what I do. Mostly I am a very focused person and disciplined. Sometimes when you have friends, you go out and throw a party and so forth, and that is actually what I meant.""

Rudisha's penchant for a post-race party is, of course, entirely natural.

But having spent two days earlier that week getting behind-the-scenes access to marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge's regime the contrast is striking.

Life in Kipchoge's Spartan training camp in Kenya's Rift Valley is all work and no play. Kipchoge - and 30 other athletes - live in dormitories in Kaptagat from Monday to Saturday. Away from their families and other distractions their life is simple. Train, eat, rest, repeat.

""Eliud's discipline is exceptional,"" Rudisha says. ""If you go back, Eliud can give you his training plan for the past two, three years. I don't think I have something like that.""

I ask if that is not his way. Rudisha lets out a big laugh.

""That's not my way. I do things more relaxed,"" he says.

""I do so passionately. Running is something you have to enjoy sometimes. It is hard but you just have to enjoy and you have to make it look like fun.""

To illustrate that more intuitive approach, Rudisha tells an anecdote about his pre-London 2012 training sessions.

His world record time of 1:40.91, set in an Olympic final having already run heats and a semi-final, was arguably as stratospheric as Kipchoge's ""moon-landing moment"" last year when he became the first man to run a sub two-hour marathon.

However, while Kipchoge had a team of hundreds of support staff who left no stone unturned in their search for perfection - climate, diet, training, trainers - Rudisha's key sessions before London 2012 didn't even feature a stopwatch.

""At a certain point I just needed to do some splits with my mind,"" he says.

""I gave Brother Colm [his coach, Brother Colm O'Connell] the watch. If I said I wanted to run 400m in 53, 54, 55 seconds I would do it, without the watch. It was amazing.

""That is how I familiarised myself with timing. It was very natural and that is why I really mastered 800m very well, in such a way that I knew exactly what I was running for the first lap. It was just there in my mind.""

Rudisha defended his Olympic title at Rio 2016 - and is still the 800m world record holder

It's easy to forget that Rudisha defended his London gold in Rio.

In fact, the man himself made the same mistake during our conversation, talking about winning a second, rather than a third, Olympic title in Tokyo.

That hat-trick would be an incredible athletic achievement for anyone. Given Rudisha's considerable issues both on and off the track for the past three years, it would be nothing short of a miracle.

We met with less than six months to go until the Olympics and Rudisha was yet to set foot on a track. He was still building up his baseline fitness with 10-kilometre runs on the dirt roads around his home in Eldoret.

But, crucially, eight years on from his greatest achievement, one of his greatest gifts has returned.

""I am happy,"" he says. ""I missed the track and I missed training for the past two years. Sport is what I loved in my life. Whenever I am out there and training I feel like I am doing what I really truly love, and I am a passionate about it.

""I know I have missed some of my best years and injury has robbed me. But I am looking forward.

""If I make the team, go to Tokyo, qualify for the final and be in that final, yes I will say I will be standing there as a potential gold medallist, or medallist in that event. But before I get there I cannot start counting things that are not ready yet.""

And with that the conversation is over.

""Ladies and gentlemen, flight 8606 to Mombasa is ready for boarding. We apologise for the delay and any inconvenience caused.""

The businessmen and women rush to gate three - visibly restless after what has been a lengthy delay.

Not Rudisha. Ticket in hand, he slowly says goodbye and takes time to pose for a picture before joining the back of the queue.

"['Umaru Fofana', 'Bbc News']","Image caption Saren Idaho (L) and Prince Latoya were held for five months in a police cell in Sierra Leone's capital

Saren Idaho said he has no connection to Sierra Leone and had never been to the country until he was deported there from the US six months ago.

""I know nobody here,"" lamented the 55-year-old father of two.

Looking unwell and struggling to walk, he sat down on a plastic chair in his sparsely furnished hotel room in the capital, Freetown. As he was talking he played with a pack of cigarettes and several butts were squashed in an ashtray beside him.

At least this was better than the crowded police cell, where he slept on the floor ""with cockroaches, rats and bed bugs"" for the first five months of his time here.

Prince Latoya, 47, was on the same deportation flight and is in the same situation.

Both men, who had never met before coming to Sierra Leone, were long-term residents of the US. But they say they were originally from the Caribbean, which the US authorities dispute.

Image caption The two men are now staying in a hotel in Sierra Leone's capital

Idaho and Latoya were expelled last August, along with 17 Sierra Leoneans, among other West Africans, who had been convicted of committing crimes in the US.

They ended up on that flight after staff at Sierra Leone's embassy in Washington DC were put under pressure by US officials, according to Isha Sillah, director for the Americas and the Pacific at the foreign ministry here.

She said that the US immigration authorities had submitted documents to the embassy that ""appeared to suggest"" that the two men were from Sierra Leone. Without cross-checking, embassy officials issued them each with an Emergency Travel Certificate (ETC).

Embassy staff had told her that ""what contributed to the issuance of the ETC was also pressure piled on them by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security"" to accept them as Sierra Leoneans.

BBC America forged documents to bring me here. And I know I was not born in this country""

""The Sierra Leone government are like puppets to the Americans,"" Latoya, who said he was originally from the Bahamas, told the BBC.

Idaho was angry with the US authorities.

""America forged documents to bring me here claiming this to be my country of citizenship,"" he said. ""And I know I was not born in this country.

""I am from the Commonwealth of Dominica. What is so hard about returning to the US?""

'Denied by Dominica'

This has now become a massive bureaucratic problem.

The foreign ministry has contacted the two Caribbean countries' embassies in Washington to certify that the two men were born there.

""The Dominican embassy has denied that Idaho is their national while the Bahamian embassy says more documents are needed to enable them make a determination - hence it's inconclusive,"" Ms Sillah said.

Meanwhile, they are stuck in limbo in the hotel.

Image copyright Mowanda Idaho Image caption Idaho, pictured with his children 10 years ago, wants to be reunited with his family

The manager, Osman Kamara, said the men were checked in by the police with an advance payment for their lodging, but that ran out and an anonymous businessman stepped in to pay the bills to stop them being thrown out.

He also paid for a food and clothing allowance.

Before that, they were each getting $2.50 (£2) to cover daily costs, which they said barely paid for breakfast and bottled water.

""We have been living here with no food, no medical care, nothing,"" Latoya said.

Lost ID

The two men had been receiving extra money from relatives sent through Western Union. But as their Sierra Leone travel documents have now expired, they can no longer pick up the cash as a valid photo ID is required.

Idaho said he had been living in the US for 28 years until he was arrested and jailed in 2018 for driving while drunk.

He has lost all his ID documents. They were in a house that was seized by the bank as he was unable to pay the mortgage because he was imprisoned, he said.

""All my possessions, including my birth certificate, are locked in a store somewhere after the takeover of the house,"" he told the BBC.

Image copyright Mowanda Idaho Image caption Mowanda Idaho said that her two sons are missing their dad

His wife of 17 years, Mowanda Idaho, and his two sons, aged 14 and 11, are now living in the US state of South Carolina.

""It has been devastating for me and the two boys with the 14-year-old now living in a state of depression and failing in school,"" Ms Idaho, who is an American citizen, said by phone.

She last saw him for ""a five-minute encounter"" when he was taken to prison in April 2018.

She had spoken to an immigration lawyer who told her that he had heard nothing like her husband's case before. But she says she cannot afford the legal fees to take the authorities to court.

Latoya, who had lived in the US for 25 years, was convicted of identity theft. He said he had no wife or children.

'They said they were from Sierra Leone'

But the US government sees things differently.

In an email to the BBC, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described Latoya as a ""criminal alien who has been convicted of multiple identity theft-related criminal offenses"".

It said that he entered the country illegally in 1997, and ""on numerous occasions, Latoya stated to US immigration officers that he was a citizen of Sierra Leone"".

The Sierra Leonean embassy in Washington confirmed his citizenship, the DHS said.

BBC I never told then I was from Sierra Leone. Ask them to produce anything that said I claimed Sierra Leonean citizenship""

Latoya vehemently denied that he had made any claim to being from Sierra Leone.

""I never told then I was from Sierra Leone,"" he said.

""I don't know where they got this idea from. I went [to the US] by boat from the Bahamas. Ask them to produce anything that said I claimed Sierra Leonean citizenship.""

The US authorities also called Idaho ""a criminal alien"", who entered the country in 1999, adding that he had ""multiple convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol"".

He had told the immigration officials that he was from Sierra Leone, according to the email from the DHS.

""I never claimed Sierra Leonean citizenship,"" Idaho said in response. ""I don't have a multiple criminal record. I have only one conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol.""

As for the idea that the US authorities pressurised the Sierra Leonean embassy into issuing travel documents, the DHS is adamant that this did not happen.

In fact, it said that ""Sierra Leone has a history of refusing to issue travel documents for its citizens"", a situation which put the country under temporary US visa sanctions in 2017.

Waiting for travel documents

But the government here does not think the men are Sierra Leonean. It had wanted to fly the two men to the Caribbean, but without confirmation of their citizenship it now hopes to hand them over to the International Office for Migration (IOM).

The IOM chief in Sierra Leone, Sanusi Savage, said that his agency had not received an official request. He said he had only received phone calls from foreign ministry officials including from the minister, Nabilla Tunis, to help.

""I promised to support them with tickets but upon producing official travel documents and acceptance of their countries of origin,"" he told the BBC.

But that has not happened yet and the two men continue to live at the mercy of bureaucratic bickering.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51585330,BBC,Africa,TRUE
"['Rick Kelsey', 'Newsbeat Reporter']","Babacar Sarr is a 29-year-old footballer who's played in top teams across the globe, including in one of the world's highest paying leagues.

He's also a fugitive, wanted in a rape case in Norway and the subject of an international arrest warrant.

He maintains his innocence and now has dropped off the radar.

Sarr is a Senegalese midfielder who built his reputation in Norwegian football, before playing in the top leagues in Russia and Saudi Arabia.

He was a star player at Molde, a top league Norwegian club he joined in 2016. He played there for about two years when the club was managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - who's now the manager of Manchester United.

'He was the engine of the team'

""Sarr was the engine, the motor of the team in a way,"" says Lars Johnsen, a journalist from Josimar, an independent online football magazine based in Norway.

""He had all these qualities, was good on the ball - everything,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.

But while his career flourished, Sarr faced multiple allegations of rape.

He was first accused in 2015, when he was playing for another Norwegian team. He was accused of raping a woman during an end-of-season trip to Stockholm. Police investigated but didn't press charges.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Molde, where Babacar Sarr lived for three years

After the move to Molde, Sarr faced further accusations of rape. He denies all the allegations against him.

In March 2018, he was charged for the first time, with a rape that allegedly took place at an after-party in an apartment in Molde in 2017.

Newsbeat spoke with the alleged victim who claims she woke to find him ""on top of her"".

Sarr continued to play for Molde before his trial, leading to anti-rape campaigners turning up at the team's matches with banners saying ""No Means No"", and anti-rape chants being sung at games.

After a joint criminal and civil trial, Sarr was found not guilty in August 2018 of the criminal charge.

But he was ordered to pay his accuser compensation of 150,000 Norwegian kroner (around £12,500) after the court ruled in her favour on the civil claim. Both sides appealed against the result.

Image copyright Ingvild Thorn Nordheim Image caption Ingvild Thorn Nordheim is a senior prosecutor in Norway

Sarr's Molde contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2019. At the time, Norwegian papers reported that the club thanked him for his contribution ""through a difficult time for the player as well as the club"".

The prosecution's appeal hearing against his acquittal was set for February 2019. But it had to be delayed, because both the defendant and a witness didn't appear in court.

In Norway, a criminal trial can't go ahead for serious crimes if the suspect isn't there, which is different to the UK.

By this time, he was more than 4,000 miles away, in Siberia, Russia.

'A huge mistake by the police'

In February 2019, Sarr signed for Yenisey Krasnoyarsk, a team in the Russian Premier League.

Following huge investment by wealthy club owners, the Russian league is now the seventh highest-paid football division in the world, so it was a big move for Sarr in his footballing career.

The extradition process between Russia and other countries is known to be complicated.

Then in June last year, just before he was due to appear in court in Norway for the rescheduled appeal hearing, Sarr signed for another club, this time in Saudi Arabia.

Around the same time, it emerged that Norwegian prosecutors had issued an international arrest warrant for him through Interpol, the organisation that helps police across the world work together on serious crimes.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sarr (right) moved from Norway to Russia then to Saudi Arabia

He joined Damac FC, a team on the rise in the Saudi top division, moving to a country where there is no extradition treaty with Norway. That means there was no agreement between those countries to send Sarr back to Norway for his case to be heard again in court.

But then in January, Sarr's contract with Damac FC was suddenly cancelled before the end of the season.

Damac didn't respond when Radio 1 Newsbeat asked why that was.

Around the same time, it emerged that he'd been charged with a second rape - one that was alleged to have taken place in Oslo, at Molde's end-of-season party in November 2018.

That second charge was recently dropped because Oslo police failed to notify Babacar Sarr within three months after being asked by prosecutors - the time limit allowed under Norwegian law.

The Oslo state prosecutor's office told us that the police were ""unsuccessful in their attempts at serving the indictment on Mr Sarr"".

This has been described by a senior law professor at the University of Bergen as ""a huge mistake by the police"".

Oslo police responded to Newsbeat saying they were unable to comment on cases that have been transferred to prosecutors.

Image copyright Josimar / Damac FC Image caption Damac FC in Saudi Arabia welcomed Babacar Sarr in June 2019 in a tweet

It's from January this year that Sarr's whereabouts become less clear.

No other club appears to have signed him.

There have been no sightings of him since the last of his 13 games with Damac.

A tweet that Damac had posted celebrating Sarr joining when he was signed last year appears to have been deleted, and Newsbeat could find no other references to him on the club's account.

Sarr's Instagram account, which was public, is now private.

Sarr's story has been in the news last month after one of his alleged victims told the Daily Telegraph that she thinks Solskjaer is ""not fit to lead"" Manchester United after his decision to keep playing Sarr at Molde after his original charge.

She thinks that football players charged with sexual assaults should not be allowed to continue playing until the case has been resolved.

""It's about the signal it sends, especially when it's someone's kids who looks up to them,"" she says.

Manchester United told The Telegraph that Solskjaer fully respected the due process of the Norwegian legal system.

In response to this case, UK campaigners have called for football clubs to suspend players if they are on trial for serious sexual offences.

'Nothing strange about this situation'

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The midfielder Babacar Sarr when he played for Molde

With no club linked to him, Sarr's whereabouts are unknown.

Norway's state prosecutor, Ingvild Thorn Nordheim, issued the international arrest warrant.

She says Sarr and his lawyers haven't answered any communication from her.

Newsbeat has seen court documents showing Norwegian prosecutors asking Saudi Arabian officials where he is, but receiving no concrete answers.

Lars Johnsen, says all the indications are he's still in Saudi Arabia, but he can't be sure.

""I have to say Saudi - but I don't know,"" he says.

""He might be in Senegal.""

He believes Sarr will be looking for his next move and may soon leave Saudi Arabia if he hasn't already.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sarr moved to Krasnoyarsk to play in the Russian Premier League - sometimes known as the prettiest city in Siberia

For now, his location - as well as whether he'll come back to Norway to face the appeal - are a mystery.

Sarr's lawyer, Yvonne Larsen, told Newsbeat the issue of the first rape has been ""dealt with already"" because Sarr was found not guilty at his first trial.

She added that Sarr continued to play football while he was charged because ""everyone is innocent until guilt is proved by the law, and Mr Sarr is still innocent"".

""There is nothing strange about this situation at all.""

As for one of the alleged victims, she has decided to move away from Molde.

She ""doesn't get her hopes up that the appeal will happen"" and wants to rebuild her life in another city.

Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus.

When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

The government is to release social distancing advice for the elderly on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods.

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35.

Mr Hancock told the BBC manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS, and hotels could be turned into hospitals, Mr Hancock said.

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care.

Earlier, 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Image copyright Nick Matthews Facebook Image caption Mary Matthews paid tribute to her husband, Nick, on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""best friend""

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"", following Mr Matthews' death at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

She said she and her family were ""currently in isolation"" until they received their coronavirus test results back and urged people not to visit them until they got the all-clear.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had recently returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, flying out on February 22 and returning on February 29.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are not being tested, with the government prioritising tests for those ""most at risk of severe illness"".

Tests will primarily be given:

To all patients in critical care for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

To all other patients requiring hospital admission for pneumonia, ARDS or flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

Earlier, Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would be told within weeks they needed to remain at home, with groceries and vital medication delivered - but he did not give details about how long this would be for or when it would start.

Mr Hancock told Andrew Marr people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends so long as they stayed two metres - or six feet - apart from them.

All the UK deaths from the virus so far have been among people aged over 60 or with underlying health conditions.

The Scottish government set out its interpretation of the strategy, saying it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.

""What we're saying to them is, reduce your contact.""

The Scottish government has also published its guidance that gatherings of 500 people or more should not take place in Scotland.

Although it does not have the power to call off events, it has urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" in cancelling large gatherings from Monday to help the efforts of emergency services.

'Start making more ventilators'

Manufacturers including car makers, weapon makers and army suppliers are to be asked to switch their production lines to making ventilators for use in hospitals treating coronavirus - which can cause severe breathing problems.

Digger manufacturer JCB said it has been approached by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to see if it could help with the production of ventilators.

The company chairman, Lord Bamford, said it was ""unclear as yet"" whether it could assist, but its research and engineering teams were ""actively looking"" at the request.

The health service is to stop non-urgent surgery and implement a huge training programme to retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those who become seriously ill with the Covid-19 disease.

What is a ventilator?

A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide

Ventilators can be used to help a person breathe if they have lung disease or another condition that makes breathing difficult. They can also be used during and post-surgery

A tube, connected to a ventilator machine, is placed in a person's mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat (called a tracheostomy)

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment, but that many times that number would be needed.

Work is also under way to buy up thousands of private hospital beds to boost NHS capacity should it be needed and the possibility that empty hotels may be requisitioned has not been ruled out.

Mr Hancock earlier used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to liken the coronavirus crisis to World War Two.

He wrote that, despite the Blitz, the UK ""pulled together in one gigantic national effort"" and that the same must happen once more.

It came as the government's strategy was criticised by some scientists, who wrote to ministers urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

""Of course there is a scientific debate around scientific concepts but I want to be absolutely crystal clear, we will do what is necessary,"" Mr Hancock said.

An emergency bill giving the government temporary powers to tackle the outbreak will be published next week.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the government is ""well behind the curve"" in its management of the outbreak and urged No 10 to give ""clearer guidance"" and ""much better support"".

He insisted the government had not acted ""fast enough"" to tackle the virus, citing concerns over the availability of NHS beds, ventilators and staff.

He said he had written to Mr Johnson demanding a meeting and to ask what would be in the emergency legislation that is to be presented to Parliament next week.

Why and when should vulnerable self-isolate?

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks or so.

That's why it's essential people don't go too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self isolating.

But the officials recognise that individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's nuanced approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging them to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19.

In an open letter, the 229 specialists in disciplines ranging from mathematics to genetics - though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases - say the UK's current approach will put the NHS under additional stress and ""risk many more lives than necessary"".

The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune.

The Department of Health said Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

The scientists - all from UK universities - also questioned the government's view that people would become fed up with restrictions if they were imposed too soon.

Their letter was published on the day it was announced 10 more people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 21.

Meanwhile the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) advised that measures to protect vulnerable people - including household isolation - ""will need to be instituted soon"".

Sir Patrick and the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, have said they intend to publish the computer models on which their strategy is based.

The UK's approach to coping with the coronavirus pandemic has been in stark contrast to other countries. The whole of Italy has been on lockdown since Tuesday, while Poland is set to close its borders for two weeks.

On Saturday the French government ordered the closure of all non-essential public locations from midnight (23:00 GMT Saturday).

And Spain has declared a 15-day national lockdown on Monday to battle the virus,

Measures 'insufficient'

In the open letter the group of scientists argue that stronger ""social distancing measures"" would ""dramatically"" slow the rate of growth of the disease in the UK, and would spare ""thousands of lives"".

The group, specialising in a range of disciplines, ranging from mathematics to genetics, though no leading experts in the science of the spread of diseases, said the current measures are ""insufficient"" and ""additional and more restrictive measures should be taken immediately"", as is happening in other countries.

On Friday, Sir Patrick suggested managing the spread of the disease so that the population gains some immunity to the disease was a part of the government strategy.

This idea, known as ""herd immunity"", means at-risk individuals are protected from infection because they are surrounded by people who are resistant to the disease.

Rough estimates indicate that herd immunity to Covid-19 would be reached when approximately 60% of the population has had the disease.

But in the open letter, the scientists said: ""Going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option.""

'Laissez-faire attitude'

The major downside of herd immunity, according to Birmingham University's Prof Willem van Schaik, is that this will mean that in the UK alone at least 36 million people will need to be infected and recover.

""It is almost impossible to predict what that will mean in terms of human costs, but we are conservatively looking at tens of thousands of deaths, and possibly at hundreds of thousands of deaths,"" he said.

""The only way to make this work would be to spread out these millions of cases over a relatively long period of time so that the NHS does not get overwhelmed.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Willem Von Schaik, professor of microbiology and infection at the University of Birmingham, was one of the signatories

Prof van Schaik noted that the UK is the only country in Europe that is following what he described as its ""laissez-faire attitude to the virus"".

But a Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said that Sir Patrick's comments had been misinterpreted.

""Herd immunity is not part of our action plan, but is a natural by-product of an epidemic. Our aims are to save lives, protect the most vulnerable, and relieve pressure on our NHS,"" he said.

""We have now moved out of the contain phase and into delay, and we have experts working round the clock. Every measure that we have or will introduce will be based on the best scientific evidence.

""Our awareness of the likely levels of immunity in the country over the coming months will ensure our planning and response is as accurate and effective as possible.""

In a separate letter to the government, more than 200 behavioural scientists have questioned the government's argument that starting tougher measures too soon would lead to people not sticking to them just at the point that the epidemic is at its height.

""While we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about 'behavioural fatigue' or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,"" the letter said.

""Such evidence is necessary if we are to base a high-risk public health strategy on it.""

""In fact, it seems likely that even those essential behaviour changes that are presently required (e.g., handwashing) will receive far greater uptake the more urgent the situation is perceived to be. Carrying on as normal for as long as possible undercuts that urgency,"" it added.

The scientists said ""radical behaviour change"" could have a ""much better"" effect and could ""save very large numbers of lives"".

""Experience in China and South Korea is sufficiently encouraging to suggest that this possibility should at least be attempted,"" it added.

The second letter called on the government to reconsider its stance on ""behavioural fatigue"" and to share the evidence on which it based this stance.

A drug that prevents the transmission of the HIV virus will be available in England from April, the Department of Health has confirmed.

PrEP - or pre-exposure prophylaxis - is an antiretroviral medicine which, taken once a day, stops the transmission of HIV during unprotected sex.

The pill is already available in Scotland and Wales to people at risk of contracting the virus.

It is estimated there are about 103,800 people living with HIV in the UK.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the roll-out of the drug in England would eliminate new HIV infections within 10 years.

NHS England will pay for the drug.

The cost is estimated to likely be much less than the lifetime bill for treating those who already carry the virus.

The Terrence Higgins Trust, a charity that supports those living with HIV, estimates that about 7% of the roughly 103,800 people living with the virus in the UK do not know they are HIV positive.

Ian Green, Chief Executive at the Terrence Higgins Trust, described the development as a ""game-changer"" for HIV prevention.

But he said more work needed to be done to ensure the benefits of PrEP were made clear to groups other than gay and bisexual men, such as women, trans people and BAME communities.

Sir Elton John, whose foundation supports HIV prevention and treatment, welcomed the government's decision.

""Taking PrEP prevents HIV from being passed on, which is truly incredible,"" he told the Sunday Times.

""It is the right decision for the UK government to roll this out more widely to minimise the spread of this disease so more people are protected - which is critical in fighting any epidemic.""

What is PrEP?

A pill taken daily, or on demand prior to having sex, to prevent HIV infection

If taken consistently, when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV, it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying

A UK Medical Research Council-run study comparing gay men on PrEP against non-users found an 86% fall in new HIV infections in PrEP users

Many in the sexual health sector say PrEP, when taken correctly, is almost 100% effective

It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk, including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed

Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections

But PrEP does have its critics, with some commentators saying funding it will lead to an abdication of personal responsibility, with men choosing not to use condoms.

Unlike condoms, PrEP does not protect against other sexually-transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhoea - of which the numbers of infections are rising.

In 2018, new HIV diagnoses in the UK fell to their lowest level since 2000 - 4,484 people - due to the success of preventative measures, Public Health England said.

The decline has been attributed to a mix of prevention methods, such as testing, condom provision, and the wider use of PrEP.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51897856,BBC,Health,TRUE

Planned surgery is to be cancelled in Wales as the NHS gears up to tackle the coronavirus outbreak.

On Saturday, Public Health Wales said the number of cases had risen to 60.

Cutting back on so-called ""elective"" operations - those waiting for non-urgent treatment - had been put forward as one of the likely options as the pandemic escalates and more patients with the virus need treating.

Non-urgent outpatient appointments will also be put on hold.

Waiting time targets and monitoring arrangements are also being relaxed.

Meanwhile, Welsh Rugby Union chairman Gareth Davies has defended the decision to postpone Wales' Six Nations game with Scotland, just 24 hours before kick-off.

Also, Cardiff City have confirmed a player and member of staff are self-isolating as a precaution, while a Wrexham FC player has been told to self-isolate after seeking medical advice, with the team's weekend game against Barrow postponed.

Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""I am choosing to act now before we see a significant surge in demand so that our services can be ready to act. A larger number of people requiring high levels of care is highly likely over the coming weeks.""

He stressed that access to cancer and other essential treatments such as kidney dialysis would continue.

The minister said the priority was to save as many lives as possible, with 25,000 deaths in Wales possible in a worst case scenario.

What actions have been outlined?

Suspending non-urgent outpatient appointments to ensure urgent appointments were prioritised

Suspending non-urgent surgical admissions and procedures - but ensuring access for emergency and urgent surgery

Prioritising the use of non-emergency patient transport to focus on hospital discharges and ambulance emergency response

Expediting discharge of vulnerable patients from acute and community hospitals

Relaxing targets and monitoring arrangements across the health and care system

Minimising regulation requirements for health and care settings

Fast-tracking placements to care homes by suspending the current protocol which gives to right to a choice of home

Giving permission to cancel internal and professional events, including study leave, to free up staff for preparations

Relaxing contract and monitoring arrangements for GPs and primary care practitioners

Suspending NHS emergency service and health volunteer support to mass gatherings and events

EASY STEPS: How to keep safe

With the peak believed to be 10 to 14 weeks away, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was about making the ""right decisions at the right time"".

Earlier on Friday, the Welsh Government hinted at the move, saying it would need to consider reducing planned activity.

There are currently about 390,000 referrals waiting for hospital treatment in Wales - including some patients on multiple waiting lists. These include 47,000 orthopaedic referrals.

There were also 3 million outpatient appointments in the past year.

This could mean some quite big operations, including heart surgery, will be postponed for people - particularly if patients require intensive care afterwards.

But clinical decisions will have to be made if the conditions of patients deteriorate as they wait and they become emergencies.

We are used to seeing the temporary cancellation of planned surgery used as a pressure valve in the NHS by individual health boards, to relieve demand during winter pressures.

But in the wake of this crisis and the anticipated demand, to see this directed centrally by NHS Wales, is unprecedented.

Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""We would ask members of the public to help by being patient and understanding staff are working tirelessly.

""It is important to remember that we all have a responsibility to take precautions to minimise the chances of catching or spreading Covid-19"".

On Wednesday, a senior intensive care consultant warned about the supply of beds and staffing, because critical care units normally work at more than 90% capacity.

Dr Jack Parry-Jones, Welsh board member for the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said Wales was ""uniquely at risk"" if there was a surge of very sick people.

Europe is now the ""epicentre"" of the global coronavirus pandemic, the head of the World Health Organization says.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to use aggressive measures, community mobilisation and social distancing to save lives.

""Do not just let this fire burn,"" he said.

His comments came as several European countries reported steep rises in infections and deaths. Italy has recorded its highest daily toll yet.

There were 250 deaths recorded over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 1,266, with 17,660 infections overall.

Spain, the worst-affected European country after Italy, reported a 50% jump in fatalities to 120 on Friday. Infections increased to 4,231.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says a state of alert will come into effect there on Saturday for two weeks.

Controls are also being introduced at an increasing number of borders in Europe, in response to rapid spread of the virus.

Why is Europe the 'epicentre'?

More than 132,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in 123 countries around the world, according to the WHO.

The total number of deaths has reached about 5,000 - a figure Dr Tedros described as ""a tragic milestone"".

""Europe has now become the epicentre of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China,"" he said.

""More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic.""

As well as the increases in Spain and Italy, France has now confirmed 2,876 cases and 79 deaths, up from a total of 61 deaths on Thursday.

Germany has seen 3,062 cases and five deaths. There have been 798 confirmed infections in the UK and 11 deaths.

What are European countries doing about it?

Announcing the state of alert in Spain, Mr Sanchez said the government would ""mobilise all the resources of state to better protect the health of all of its citizens"".

It will be able to limit movement, order evacuations, prohibit access to certain places and intervene in industry for up to 15 days.

""Victory depends on every single one of us,"" Mr Sanchez said. ""Heroism is also about washing your hands and staying at home.""

All but ""essential travel"" to parts of Spain should be avoided, says the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Italy has imposed a nationwide lockdown.

Meanwhile, at least 10 other countries in Europe are enforcing border closures, including:

Denmark: Closes borders to foreign visitors from Saturday

Closes borders to foreign visitors from Saturday Czech Republic: Bans all foreigners from entering the country, except those with residence permits. Bans most of its own nationals from leaving

There are also widespread curbs on large gatherings and measures to close theatres, restaurants and bars.

Germany's Bundesliga, the only one of the big five European football leagues still being played, is to suspend games in the top two divisions from Tuesday.

Paris's Louvre - the largest art museum in the world - announced it would close from Friday, as will the Eiffel Tower.

Why Europe could be worse off than China

The number of cases of coronavirus reported every day in Europe has surpassed China at its peak.

But Europe is in a worse position.

The overwhelming majority of China's cases were in one place, Hubei province and those were largely concentrated in one city, Wuhan.

It was dealt with by an authoritarian government that imposed the biggest quarantine in human history.

While there are hotspots in Europe, this is an outbreak across a continent and different countries are adopting very different strategies for dealing with coronavirus.

All these figures are based on cases that have been detected, but scientists fear there could be large outbreaks going on unnoticed in countries that don't have the tools to spot them.

"['Pallab Ghosh', 'Science Correspondent']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Architects of the UK's ""nuanced"" approach: Sir Patrick Vallance (left) and Prof Chris Whitty (right)

Many countries are taking tough measures to crack down on the spread of coronavirus, including school closures, an end to mass gatherings and severe travel restrictions. But the UK has adopted relatively modest control measures.

The differences can be partly explained by the fact some of these countries are further into their epidemics. But it's clear the UK has adopted a more nuanced approach.

Computer simulations indicate the UK is in the early stages of its epidemic which is expected to rise sharply in four weeks and peak in 10 and 14 weeks' time.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, and chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty have made the judgement call that it is too soon to impose severe restrictions at this stage.

Such restrictions might last several months and risk ""self-isolation fatigue"", with people leaving their homes just as the epidemic was at its height. The elderly are particularly at risk of developing severe symptoms. But many of them are already isolated. Cutting them off from their communities at this stage, when the risks are still relatively low, would create unnecessary difficulties for them.

Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty have also advised against the suspension of mass gatherings. Again, their computer models indicate this would be less effective and more disruptive than the measures they have recommended: hand washing and asking people to self-isolate if they show symptoms of the disease.

These measures, if correctly implemented, could cut the peak of cases by 20%, says Sir Patrick.

""People are very much more likely to catch the virus from a family member or a friend somewhere in a small space rather than a big space [such as a sporting stadium],"" he said.

It's the same with school closures. While Ireland, France and Denmark are among a host of northern European countries to shut schools, for the moment at least they remain open in the UK.

Closing schools is effective for controlling serious flu epidemics, but Covid-19 seems to affect children less. There's still a risk, though, they could transmit it to their parents and grandparents. In addition, school closures would take many much needed NHS staff away from their jobs while they look after their children.

The British strategy is to delay the onset of the peak of the disease until the summer months, when the NHS is under less pressure, and to spread the peak of the epidemic to make treatment more manageable. The aim has also been to manage the spread of the infection so that the population builds up some immunity to the virus should it return in successive years.

Efforts to stamp it out too quickly risk leading to the epidemic returning, perhaps during the winter, once the extreme measures have been lifted. This would be a time when the health service was again under pressure.

It is important to stress that this strategy has been drawn up based on evidence and input from many of the world's leading scientists and doctors, many of whom have been involved in controlling the spread of the virus in China and Singapore. And it is notable that no UK epidemiologists - specialists in the spread of diseases - have spoken out in the mainstream media against the UK government's approach.

There are undoubtedly some who do disagree with the strategy. But there is an acceptance by such critics that Sir Patrick and Prof Whitty are the ones in the hot seat, having to make the biggest calls they have made in their professional lives. So the science community is prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and not speak out, for now at least.

Much of Italy is currently in lockdown as the country's tally of coronavirus deaths has topped 1,000.

The outbreak is putting the Italian healthcare service under immense strain. But will the UK follow this path?

On Thursday, Boris Johnson's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the UK was four weeks behind Italy ""in terms of the scale of the outbreak"" if not ""in terms of the response"".

Does that mean we're four weeks away from a similar fate?

Not necessarily. Here are three reasons why experts believe the UK's epidemic could be different from Italy's, and why the number of cases here means something different.

1. Different early transmission

The number of confirmed cases is not the same as the number of actual cases. It depends on how many infected people are detected.

The epidemics in both countries may be growing at a similar rate now, but early on the UK had more diagnosed cases than Italy. Italian numbers shot up on 23 February, leading scientists to think there was a period when the virus was spreading without being detected.

That gave less room for measures like tracing contacts of those who had fallen ill and isolating cases to slow the spread.

Professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth says that put the health system ""behind the curve"" in controlling the epidemic.

Researchers also warn that the Italy virus testing system has become overwhelmed and is not keeping up with new cases. This means Italy's figures could be falling further behind the total number of actual cases.

And as the UK adds more testing capacity, Prof Whitworth adds, we might see a ""jump in numbers"" - not just a result of greater transmission, but better detection.

2. Italy's epidemic is more concentrated

The pressure on health services also depends on where, and how severe, each case is.

There are good reasons to believe that these factors are different for the two countries. Since the initial spread, most of Italy's epidemic has been concentrated in the northern region of Lombardy, home to just over 15% of Italians.

Lombardy has accounted for almost 60 in every 100 cases in Italy. By contrast, the epidemic, so far, is more spread out in the UK. Like Lombardy, London has about 15% of citizens. But it has a smaller proportion of cases: just under 25 in 100.

So 15,000 cases spread out across the UK might not put the same pressure on hospitals as they would if they were mainly in one city or region.

The UK government is still planning for a time when the NHS will face significant challenges. But that may not be when we catch up with Italy's current number of confirmed cases.

3. More of Italy's confirmed cases are fatal

The death rate among confirmed cases in Italy is higher than in the UK. As of 12 March, the mortality rates among detected cases were 1.4% for the UK and 6.7% for Italy.

Prof Whitworth believes a higher death rate in Italy could mean that the observed cases contain a larger number of sicker patients. Italy has an older population than the UK, and the effects of Covid-19 infection have been more serious in older people.

That puts more pressure on services.

The alternative explanation for the higher death rate is that Italy's is an overwhelmed health service.

Don't relax quite yet

Even though our epidemic may not follow Italy's exactly, that doesn't mean the UK will escape serious changes to its way of life.

Epidemiologist Adam Kucharski warns against simple comparisons of case numbers and that ""without efforts to control the virus we could still see a situation evolve like that in Italy"", even if not necessarily in the next four weeks.

"['James Gallagher', 'Health', 'Science Correspondent']","Coronavirus has spread to more than 140 countries or territories, including the UK, and claimed more than 5,700 lives.

So, what is the disease and how does it spread?

How do I protect myself?

The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.

Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on then your eyes, nose or mouth.

So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important for limiting the spread.

Face masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts.

What are the coronavirus symptoms?

Coronavirus infects the lungs. The symptoms start with a fever followed by a dry cough, which can lead to breathing problems.

It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, scientists have said, but some people will get symptoms much later than this.

The incubation period lasts up to 14 days, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days.

People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but there have been suggestions some can spread the virus even before they are sick.

The early symptoms can easily be confused with other winter bugs including colds and flu.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

How deadly is coronavirus?

The proportion dying from the disease appears low (between 1% and 2%) - but the figures are unreliable.

Thousands are being treated but may go on to die - so the death rate could be higher. But it may also be lower if lots of mild cases are unreported.

A World Health Organization examination of data from 56,000 patients suggests:

6% become critically ill - lung failure, septic shock, organ failure and risk of death

14% develop severe symptoms - difficulty breathing and shortness of breath

80% develop mild symptoms - fever and cough and some may have pneumonia

Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. The data from China also suggests that men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women.

Treatment relies on keeping the patient's body going, including breathing support, until their immune system can fight off the virus. Work to develop a vaccine is under way.

What should I do if I think I have coronavirus?

The NHS says an epidemic in the UK is ""likely"".

Patients with mild symptoms - such as a new continuous cough or a high temperature above 37.8C- should self-isolate at home for at least seven days, according to the latest advice issued by Public Health England on Friday.

Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E.

Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP.

If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. People needing to do so should take ""common-sense"" steps to avoid close contact with other people, says Public Health England.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from affected areas and who may need to self-isolate, has been issued.

Other countries have introduced their own measures For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people showing symptoms to call their healthcare provider, and those who are mildly ill to self-isolate.

The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public.

Who gets tested and how does it work?

In its latest advice, Public Health England (PHE) has said those who are self-isolating with mild symptoms will not be tested.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms will be tested.

If you need testing in the UK, you may have to give samples of mucus, blood or faeces. These will be tested and results may be available on the same day.

While you await your test results, you may be asked to stay at home and self-isolate.

How fast is it spreading?

Hundreds of new cases are being reported worldwide each day. However, it is thought health agencies may be unaware of many cases.

After starting in China, coronavirus is now spreading fast in countries like South Korea, Italy and Iran.

The coronavirus emerged in only December last year, but already the world is dealing with a pandemic of the virus and the disease it causes - Covid-19.

For most, the disease is mild, but some people die.

So how is the virus attacking the body, why are some people being killed and how is it treated?

Incubation period

This is when the virus is establishing itself.

Viruses work by getting inside the cells your body is made of and then hijacking them.

The coronavirus, officially called Sars-CoV-2, can invade your body when you breathe it in (after someone coughs nearby) or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face.

It first infects the cells lining your throat, airways and lungs and turns them into ""coronavirus factories"" that spew out huge numbers of new viruses that go on to infect yet more cells.

At this early stage, you will not be sick and some people may never develop symptoms.

The incubation period, the time between infection and first symptoms appearing, varies widely, but is five days on average.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Everything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the BBC's Laura Foster

Mild disease

This is all most people will experience.

Covid-19 is a mild infection for eight out of 10 people who get it and the core symptoms are a fever and a cough.

Body aches, sore throat and a headache are all possible, but not guaranteed.

The fever, and generally feeling grotty, is a result of your immune system responding to the infection. It has recognised the virus as a hostile invader and signals to the rest of the body something is wrong by releasing chemicals called cytokines.

These rally the immune system, but also cause the body aches, pain and fever.

The coronavirus cough is initially a dry one (you're not bringing stuff up) and this is probably down to irritation of cells as they become infected by the virus.

Some people will eventually start coughing up sputum - a thick mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.

These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and paracetamol. You won't need specialist hospital care.

This stage lasts about a week - at which point most recover because their immune system has fought off the virus.

However, some will develop a more serious form of Covid-19.

This is the best we understand at the moment about this stage, however, there are studies emerging that suggest the disease can cause more cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose too.

Severe disease

If the disease progresses it will be due to the immune system overreacting to the virus.

Those chemical signals to the rest of the body cause inflammation, but this needs to be delicately balanced. Too much inflammation can cause collateral damage throughout the body.

""The virus is triggering an imbalance in the immune response, there's too much inflammation, how it is doing this we don't know,"" said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Scans of lungs infected with coronavirus showing areas of pneumonia

Inflammation of the lungs is called pneumonia.

If it was possible to travel through your mouth down the windpipe and through the tiny tubes in your lungs, you'd eventually end up in tiny little air sacs.

This is where oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide moves out, but in pneumonia the tiny sacs start to fill with water and can eventually cause shortness of breath and difficulty breathing.

Some people will need a ventilator to help them breathe.

This stage is thought to affect around 14% of people, based on data from China.

Critical disease

It is estimated around 6% of cases become critically ill.

By this point the body is starting to fail and there is a real chance of death.

The problem is the immune system is now spiralling out of control and causing damage throughout the body.

It can lead to septic shock when the blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels and organs stop working properly or fail completely.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by widespread inflammation in the lungs stops the body getting enough oxygen it needs to survive. It can stop the kidneys from cleaning the blood and damage the lining of your intestines.

""The virus sets up such a huge degree of inflammation that you succumb... it becomes multi-organ failure,"" Dr Bharat Pankhania said.

And if the immune system cannot get on top of the virus, then it will eventually spread to every corner of the body where it can cause even more damage.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A patient being treated with an ECMO machine

Treatment by this stage will be highly invasive and can include ECMO or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation.

This is essentially an artificial lung that takes blood out of the body through thick tubes, oxygenates it and pumps it back in.

But eventually the damage can reach fatal levels at which organs can no longer keep the body alive.

The first deaths

Doctors have described how some patients died despite their best efforts.

The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were seemingly healthy, although they were long-term smokers and that would have weakened their lungs.

The first, a 61-year-old man, had severe pneumonia by the time he arrived at hospital.

He was in acute respiratory distress, and despite being put on a ventilator, his lungs failed and his heart stopped beating.

He died 11 days after he was admitted.

The second patient, a 69-year-old man, also had acute respiratory distress syndrome.

He was attached to an ECMO machine but this wasn't enough. He died of severe pneumonia and septic shock when his blood pressure collapsed.

More people in the UK should isolate themselves to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced.

So, what do you need to know about self-isolation and how to do it?

What is self-isolation?

Self-isolation means cutting yourself off from the rest of the world.

You need to stay at home, not go to work, school or other public places, and avoid public transport or taxis, says Public Health England.

""Common-sense"" steps include staying in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keeping away from other people in your home.

Ask for help if you need groceries, other shopping or medication.

It's OK to have friends, family or delivery drivers drop off supplies to get you through.

But you shouldn't have any visitors, PHE says. You can have deliveries left on the doorstep.

Do I need to self-isolate?

From Friday, everyone with flu-like symptoms - defined as a fever of above 37.8C or a persistent cough - is being asked to stay at home for at least seven days.

Anyone who has travelled to an affected area, or who has been in close contact with an infected person, had already been asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

Spending 15 minutes within 2m (6ft) of someone with the virus, or having face-to-face contact, is judged as close contact and a significant risk.

Advice for people who have travelled back to the UK from the main affected areas and some other countries has been issued by the government. Full details of the countries concerned and whether you need to self-isolate are available here.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 or their GP to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

The Covid-19 disease can cause a fever, cough and breathing problems. It takes five days on average for people to start showing the symptoms.

What if someone self-isolating shares a home?

If you are self-isolating and share a kitchen, try to avoid using it when other people are there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Clean all the surfaces at home with household cleaning products daily.

Although you might not be able to entirely separate yourself from family members or flatmates, the advice is to limit contact as much as possible.

If possible stay at least 2m (6ft) from other people you live with and sleep alone. Keep away from vulnerable people.

People living with someone in isolation should wash their hands often, using soap and water for at least 20 seconds - especially after coming into contact with them.

You shouldn't share towels, toiletries or other household items with someone in isolation and they should have a separate bathroom. If that is not possible, the isolated person should use the bathroom last, cleaning it thoroughly afterwards if they are able.

Any rubbish that the isolated person has been in contact with should be double-bagged and kept. If the person tests positive, you will be told what to do with their waste.

Will I still get paid?

Workers will get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, not the fourth, to help contain coronavirus, the prime minister has said.

This means that people who have to self-isolate or who are ill would get an extra £40 to cover the first four days. This would take it up to its usual rate of £94.25 per week.

Many casual or agency workers may also be entitled to sick pay but self-employed people are not. Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick pay and should ask their employer.

In the meantime, the government says you can claim universal credit or employment and support allowance if you're prevented from working for public health reasons.

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

""We're all reaching that critical point now where we have to take stock and go, if I go to my parents I could be carrying something that could kill them. That's the reality of it.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Some people are wearing face masks although the government does not advise it

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Mental health charity Mind also has tips for those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Age UK's online advice adds: ""The government hasn't said we should stop going out or meeting up with other people.

""Most people can keep doing what they normally do as long as they don't have symptoms and maintain good hygiene practices like washing their hands regularly. You only need to stay at home and avoid contact with other people (called 'self-isolating') if you've been advised to by NHS 111 or a medical professional.""

"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

A total of 1,372 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK, with the country now ramping up measures as part of the second stage of the government's phased plan to tackle the outbreak.

Some 40,279 people in the UK have been tested for the respiratory infection so far. Thirty five people who tested positive have died.

If you can't see the look-up click here.

The following maps, charts and graphics will help you understand the situation in the UK and how the authorities are dealing with it.

1. The number of UK cases is growing

The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January.

While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase significantly at the beginning of March.

Since then, cases have been reported across the UK, with 232 new cases announced on Sunday.

Most confirmed cases are in England, which has more than 1,000. But Scotland has 153 confirmed cases, Wales has 94 and Northern Ireland has 45.

Confirmed case numbers for the UK are lower than other European countries, such as Italy, for example, where there have been more than 21,000 cases and more than 1,400 deaths, according to 15 March figures from the World Health Organization.

However, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance has said there are probably between 5,000 and 10,000 people infected in the UK at this time.

He also said that many people will no longer be tested if they are showing mild symptoms. Only those with the most serious symptoms will be given a test in hospital.

England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said the peak of the UK outbreak is most likely still 10 to 14 weeks away.

Globally, authorities have confirmed more than 140,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 5,700 deaths.

More than half the cases - about 80,000 - are in China, where the virus originated in December.

2. We are in the second phase of the government's response

The government has published its action plan for dealing with the virus, which involves three phases - contain; delay; mitigate - alongside ongoing research.

While the emphasis has been on the contain and research phases up until this week, the country has now moved to the ""delay"" phase to stop the wider spread of the virus.

As part of the delay phase, people with even mild coronavirus symptoms - defined as a temperature above 37.8 C or a ""new, continuous"" cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home for seven days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease.

Schools are also being advised to cancel trips abroad and people over 70 and those with pre-existing health conditions are being told not to go on cruises.

The delay phase could also mean further ""social distancing"" measures at a later date, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out closing schools at this stage.

Action to isolate the over-70s for an extended period to shield them from coronavirus is planned in the coming weeks, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed.

Government sources have also said mass gatherings might soon be banned to ease pressure on emergency services.

If the virus becomes even more widespread, the government may then decide to enter the third phase of mitigation, when health services are asked to focus on critical care and retired NHS staff could be asked to return to work.

3. People who think they have coronavirus should self-isolate

If you have a ""new, continuous"" cough or high temperature and think you have coronavirus you are advised not to go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. Instead, you should self isolate for seven days.

If symptoms persist beyond seven days or if you get worse you should contact the NHS's dedicated 111 online coronavirus service if you are in England.

In Scotland, you should call your GP or NHS 24 on 111 out of hours. In Wales call 111 (if available in your area) or 0845 46 47. In Northern Ireland call 111.

The UK government is now focusing on delaying the spread of coronavirus. But what might an outbreak mean for you, your job and your finances?

Here are the answers to a selection of readers' questions. (Let us know your coronavirus questions by using the form at the bottom of this article).

I run a small business. At what point should I tell people to work from home? - Kieren Johnstone, Horsham

It's really all about following government advice at this stage.

Many firms are already trialling home-working for office-based staff before any potential quarantine. This lets them test home working in a controlled way, before having to do it for real.

As a small business, you'll also need to think about your the way you are supplied, travel and your cashflow.

Also, check your insurance. Does the small print include business interruption cover? If so, does your policy have an extension for ""notifiable diseases""? Also, check if coronavirus is covered.

I'm self-employed. Can I claim benefits if I can't work due to the virus? - Mark Gribby, Nottingham

Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits, Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance.

But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before Universal Credit is paid.

People claiming Universal Credit can be paid early to help them until they receive their first payment. However, this will be taken off future benefit payments.

Unfortunately, those who are self-employed cannot get Statutory Sick Pay because that is paid by an employer.

Ask me

Will lenders be allowing people with mortgages to delay payments during the outbreak? - Clare Waters

Some banks, including NatWest and TSB, are offering customers affected by coronavirus the ability to delay their mortgage payments.

This will be decided on a case-by-case basis, a bit like the process of helping customers in financial difficulty.

Payments will be delayed for two or three months. So, it is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance.

Most probably, any future monthly mortgage bills will be slightly higher.

What will landlords do if coronavirus means people can't pay their rent? - The Urban Troopers via Twitter

At the moment, landlords are not being forced to allow tenants to delay paying their rent.

But they are being encouraged to be sympathetic if tenants have to self-isolate, or are laid off work and take a hit to their income.

The Residential Landlords Association says its members should discuss the problem with tenants, be flexible and arrange for money they owe to be repaid when things return to normal.

Most affected tenants, it says, will be in genuine hardship and suffering stress.

What if you're not on a salary and can't work from home if your workplace closes? - Joseph, Glasgow

If you are employed, your employer has an obligation to pay your Statutory Sick Pay for up to 28 weeks.

Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay Statutory Sick Pay from the first day off.

In the case of small employers, the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days,

Eligible employees are entitled to £94.25 a week.

I am buying a house. What if one party self-isolates after exchanging contracts? - Linda Lawford, Totton

When you exchange contracts for a property, you have made a contract. You would be liable to lose your deposit if you fail to complete the sale and, possibly, face a claim for damages.

In exceptional circumstances, the buyer and seller can agree to delay in completing the sale.

However, self-isolating would not necessarily mean you could not complete. This final step could be done over the phone or online.

At what point will the government advise people not to travel in confined spaces? - Lou Doret, Exeter

When its health experts advise it to do so. However, this might never happen.

For now, transport bosses in the UK say they're reviewing cleaning procedures. Transport for London says it's using a more powerful disinfectant.

Meanwhile, it's been announced that a London Underground train driver has tested positive for coronavirus.

Passenger numbers on trains have fallen as more people work at home.

Will panic buying continue to affect supermarkets? - Thomas, Porthmadog

The issue has been getting stock onto shelves quick enough to fill the gaps as shoppers strip them bare of certain products.

There has been a specific problem with hand sanitisers, where demand has outstripped supply.

But overall, the key message is that we're not going to run out of food. Shoppers should buy what they need.

If things take a serious turn for the worse, all our supermarkets have plans in place to keep us fed. The big challenge will be doing this with potentially far fewer workers.

Image copyright Getty Images

If schools are closed will there be financial help available for parents? - Richard, Eastleigh

Employers have to give you time off to deal with a domestic emergency, but they don't have to pay you.

The time you take has to be a reasonable amount. You can apply for some unpaid leave as well.

And the government has relaxed the rules for applying for benefits if you have coronavirus.

Coronavirus can affect anyone, but people with pre-existing health problems and older people are thought to be at greater risk of developing severe symptoms.

If you have a long-term health condition you may be feeling anxious. So here's what experts are advising.

Who is at risk?

Having a health condition does not make you more likely than anyone else to contract coronavirus, which is a respiratory disease.

But it appears people who are older, those with weakened immune systems and people who have underlying chronic conditions including asthma, diabetes or heart disease are more at risk of severe effects.

Most people recover from coronavirus quickly after a few days' rest. For some people, it can be more severe and, in rare cases, life-threatening. The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu:

a cough

a high temperature

shortness of breath

I have asthma, what should I do?

Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your preventer inhaler (usually brown) daily as prescribed. This will help cut your risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus.

Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service.

I'm elderly, should I self-isolate?

The latest advice from the government's chief medical adviser is that pensioners currently do not need to be self-isolating.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Older people and their families can also call Age UK Advice for free on 0800 169 65 65.

What if I have a chronic health issue?

Those with underlying medical issues such as high blood pressure, lung complaints and weakened or compromised immune systems are more likely to develop serious illness as a result of the disease.

Anyone with a higher risk from viruses such as cold or flu should take sensible steps to reduce the risk of picking up infections, and call your doctor if you're feeling unwell.

Those who begin to show symptoms should immediately contact their GP or NHS 111 for advice.

I have diabetes, what should I do?

Those living with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes could be at greater risk of more severe symptoms. Dan Howarth, head of care at Diabetes UK, said: ""Coronavirus or Covid-19 can cause complications in people with diabetes.

""If you have diabetes and you have symptoms such as cough, high temperature and feeling short of breath, you need to monitor your blood sugar closely and call the NHS 111 phone service.""

Should pregnant women worry?

There is no evidence yet that pregnant women are a high-risk group. Like anyone, they should take steps to avoid infection.

I'm a smoker, am I at higher risk?

Deborah Arnott, chief executive of public health charity, Ash, advises that those who smoke heavily should either cut back or try to quit entirely to lower their risk.

""Smokers are more likely to get respiratory infections and twice as likely to develop pneumonia as non-smokers,"" she said.

""Quitting smoking is good for your health in so many ways and smokers should see coronavirus as further motivation to give quitting a go to build up their body's defences now before coronavirus becomes widespread in the UK.""

What about my medication?

It is important that even if you are unwell, you continue to take your prescribed medication. If you need to collect prescriptions while unwell, ask a friend or family member to collect them for you.

Do I need a flu jab?

Coronavirus is an entirely different virus to flu, so the flu jab won't prevent infection, but flu can also make you sick and can be severe in certain people.

If you have not yet had your flu jab there is still time to get one. People aged 65 and over, pregnant women and children and adults with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems can get one for free on the NHS.

So how can I stay safe?

The virus is thought to be spread by coughs and via contaminated surfaces, such as handrails and door handles in public places.

Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading:

Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze

Put used tissues in the bin immediately

Wash your hands with soap and water often - use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available

Try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell

Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean

Should I use a face mask or avoid public places?

The British Lung Foundation says it does not recommend using a face mask ""as there isn't enough evidence to show how effective they are. Also, for people living with a lung condition wearing a face mask can make breathing more difficult.""

"['Robert Cuffe', 'Head Of Statistics']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 50 countries have now confirmed cases

Researchers currently think that between five and 40 coronavirus cases in 1,000 will result in death, with a best guess of nine in 1,000 or about 1%.

On Tuesday, the World Health Organization's Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that ""globally, about 3.4% of reported Covid-19 cases have died"".

Scientists' estimate of the death rate is lower because not all cases are reported.

On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK government's ""very best assessment"" was that the mortality rate was ""2% or, likely, lower"".

But it depends on a range of factors: your age, sex and general health and the health system you are in.

How hard is it to work out the death rate?

It is PhD-level hard. Even counting cases is tricky.

Most cases of most viruses will go uncounted because people tend not to visit the doctor with mild symptoms.

The different death rates we are seeing reported around the world are unlikely to be due to different versions of the virus.

According to research by Imperial College, it's because different countries are better or worse at spotting the milder, harder to count cases.

So under-reporting cases makes it easy to overestimate the death rate. But you can also get it wrong in the other direction.

It takes time before an infection results in recovery or death.

If you include all cases that haven't yet had a chance to run their course, you will underestimate the death rate because you are missing the cases that will end in death later.

Scientists combine individual pieces of evidence about each of these questions to build a picture of the death rate.

For example, they estimate the proportion of cases with mild symptoms from small, defined groups of people who are monitored very tightly, like people on repatriated flights.

But slightly different answers from those pieces of evidence will add up to big changes in the overall picture.

If you just use data from Hubei, where the death rate has been much higher than elsewhere in China, then the overall death rate will look much worse.

So scientists give a range as well as a best current estimate.

But even that doesn't tell the full story because there is no single death rate.

What's the risk for people like me?

Even though the death rates among confirmed cases don't tell us about the precise risk in any single group, their patterns can tell us about who is most at risk.

Some types of people are more likely to die if they contract coronavirus: the elderly, the unwell and, maybe, men.

In the first big analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was ten times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged.

The death rates were lowest for the under 30s - there were eight deaths in 4,500 cases.

And deaths were at least five times more common among people with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart or breathing problems.

There was even a slightly higher number of deaths among men compared to women.

All of these factors interact with each other and we don't yet have a complete picture of the risk for every type of person in every location.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At least 621 people were infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan

What's the risk for people where I live?

A group of 80-year-old men in China could have very different risks to men of the same age in Europe or Africa.

Your prognosis also depends on the treatment you get.

In turn, that depends on what is available and the stage of the epidemic.

If the epidemic takes off, then healthcare systems could get swamped with cases - there are only so many intensive care units or ventilators available in any given area.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronavirus patients in England are being treated at a specialist centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London

Is it more dangerous than flu?

We can't compare mortality rates because many people with mild flu symptoms choose never to visit a doctor.

So we don't know how many cases there are of flu, or any new virus every year.

But flu continues to kill people in the UK, as it does every winter.

As the data evolves, scientists will develop a clearer picture of who would be most at risk should a coronavirus outbreak arrive in the UK.

The basic advice from the WHO is that you can protect yourself from all respiratory viruses by washing your hands, avoiding people who are coughing and sneezing and trying not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth.

With the number of coronavirus patients rising around the world, children are being exposed to information and misinformation from many sources. How can parents best keep them up to date without terrifying them?

""Will I get sick?""

""Will my school close?""

""Will grandma or granddad die?""

Coronavirus is dominating the news and children, as always, are asking direct, difficult questions about what's going to happen.

While the risk of young people being seriously affected by the virus appears low, doom-laden social media posts and playground rumours can induce panic.

Stories of deaths, possible food shortages and school closures, and the circulation of phrases like ""pandemic potential"" can add to a sense of alarm.

Keeping control

So tone is vital when discussing coronavirus with a child, advises Angharad Rudkin, clinical psychologist and consultant on the parenting book What's My Child Thinking?

""We all enjoy scare stories to a degree, but we don't like to hear them quite so much when they're a bit closer to home,"" she says. ""Help your child put some distance between them and the threat by giving information about how coronavirus is spread and what we can do to help minimise the risk such as using loads of lovely bubbles when washing our hands.""

Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus which seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. After about a week, it leads to shortness of breath and some patients require hospital treatment.

Medics aren't sure exactly how it spreads from person to person, but similar viruses do so via droplets, such as those produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

It's essential to talk to a child about things he or she can control, such as disposing of tissues and personal hygiene, Dr Rudkin says, rather than those they cannot.

Once the explanation is over, the conversation should move on to something that ""isn't threatening, such as what they had for lunch or who do they think is going to win the football match this evening"", she adds.

The virus could affect millions of people around the world soon. The UK government says, in its latest plans, that up to a fifth of workers could be off sick at the peak of an epidemic, with school closures possible.

One problem in explaining the virus is that it's difficult to predict what will happen, though early, albeit limited, evidence suggests children with Covid-19 have tended to show mild symptoms.

While parents have long experience in explaining global threats - war, terrorism and climate change - pre-adolescent children are still developing their ability to assess risk, says Dr Rudkin. So it's important to find out what their level of worry over coronavirus is.

""Be clear that you don't know all of the answers but that there are people making decisions for us who have all the information they need.""

Parents, in turn, should be as informed as possible before explaining issues to children, including keeping up with official advice, Dr Rudkin says.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How to wash your hands: 30-second guide

In the event that a boy or girl catches coronavirus, parents are advised not to overplay any risk to their health.

""You could tell them it's 'a bit like feeling sore', so they get to see it's not as dreadful as they might believe,"" Jon Gilmartin, a speech language therapist at the children's communication charity I Can, says.

Older people and those with existing health conditions are thought to be most at risk of death or serious sickness from catching coronavirus. This could lead children to worry about older friends and relatives.

Dr Rudkin advises honesty over the argument ""we will all die eventually but chances are not until we are really, really old"".

Use simple language

""But we can talk about it with a smile and use humour, or at least a lightness of touch, that doesn't then plummet our children into an existential pit they really don't need to be in, until they're 13 at least,"" she adds. ""Reassure your child that you and granddad are really fit and strong and that you will continue to do all you can to keep yourself/granddad healthy and safe.""

Children's capacity to deal with complex and worrying information increases with age, so the way a parent speaks to a three-year-old is very different to dealing with a teenager - and it involves a personal judgement.

But Mr Gilmartin suggests the use of ""simple language"" for all age groups and allowing children to ask ""lots of questions"" to show they're being listened to.

Parents who themselves are looking for the right language to use, could start with the BBC's Newsround coverage.

Children, like the rest of the population, are exposed to myths and misinformation about coronavirus, via playground gossip and, particularly among pre-teens and teenagers, on social media.

The best way to combat this is providing ""age-appropriate information and reassurance"", says Dr Rudkin, as the source young people trust best is a parent.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51734855,BBC,Health,TRUE

Coronavirus has spread to more than 60 countries and the UK government says more cases are ""likely"".

There is currently no vaccine available to protect people against the disease. But when could that change?

When will there be a coronavirus vaccine?

Researchers have developed vaccines and are starting to test them on animals, and if that goes well there could be human trials later in the year.

But even if scientists can celebrate having developed a vaccine before Christmas, there is still the massive job of being able to mass-produce it.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine

It means, realistically, one would not be ready until at least the middle of next year.

All of this is happening on an unprecedented timescale and using new approaches to vaccines, so there are no guarantees everything will go smoothly.

Remember there are four coronaviruses that already circulate in human beings. They cause the common cold, and we don't have vaccines for any of them.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

Would it protect people of all ages?

It will, almost inevitably, be less successful in older people. This is not because of the vaccine itself, but aged immune systems do not respond as well to immunisation. We see this every year with the flu jab.

All medicines, even Paracetamol, have side effects. But without clinical trials it is impossible to know what the side effects of an experimental vaccine may be.

Until a vaccine is ready what treatments are there?

Vaccines prevent infections and the best way of doing that at the moment is good hygiene.

If you are infected by coronavirus, then for most people it would be mild. There are some anti-viral drugs being used in clinical trials, but we cannot say for sure that any of these work.

How do you create a vaccine?

Vaccines harmlessly show viruses or bacteria (or even small parts of them) to the immune system. The body's defences recognise them as an invader and then learn how to fight it.

Then if the body is ever exposed for real, it already knows how to fight the infection.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference?

The main method of vaccination for decades has been to use the original virus.

The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is made by using weakened versions of those viruses that cannot cause a full-blown infection. The seasonal flu jab is made by taking the main strains of flu doing the rounds and completely disabling them.

The work on a new coronavirus vaccine is using newer, and less tested, approaches called ""plug and play"" vaccines. Because we know the genetic code of the new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, we now have the complete blueprint for building that virus.

Some vaccine scientists are lifting small sections of the coronavirus's genetic code and putting it into other, completely harmless, viruses.

,"Image copyright Cransley School Image caption Cransley School in Cheshire has been closed over coronavirus symptom fears

Some UK schools have closed over fears pupils and staff members may have been exposed to coronavirus after travelling abroad during the half-term break.

Others have sent pupils and staff home, as the illness continues to spread across Europe.

However, Public Health England (PHE) says it is not advising schools to shut to stem the spread of the virus.

Why are some schools closing their doors?

One academy chain chief executive told BBC News the decision to close one of his schools - Trinity Catholic College, in Middlesbrough - was primarily about the school's duty of care towards pupils and staff.

Hugh Hegarty, head of the Nicholas Postgate Catholic Academy Trust, which oversees the closed school, said he had made the decision after 36 pupils and eight staff members returned from a skiing trip to Italy over half-term.

""It's important people acknowledge that schools and other organisations have a duty of care to staff and have a duty of care to their children - and that is my paramount concern,"" said Mr Hegarty.

""The challenge for us was... the children had returned to school on Monday, so there had been the potential that the total school population had been exposed - even though it was minimal - to the potential risk and potential threat.

""The decision was made to advise those parents who had children on the ski trip to self-isolate and the other students to remain at home until we commence a deep clean.""

In Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the ContinU Plus Academy closed for the day on Wednesday after a staff member had been in ""close contact"" with a family member self-isolating following a trip to northern Italy.

William Martin Church of England Junior, Infant and Nursery School in Harlow, Essex, also closed on Wednesday after a staff member had returned from Italy.

Head teacher Gina Bailey said: ""The school is closed for one day and it is purely as a precaution. The staff member is not displaying any symptoms of the virus.""

But other schools have decided not to close following ski trips to northern Italy.

At St Aldhelm's Academy, in Dorset, head teacher Jon Webb wrote to parents: ""As it currently stands, we are not aware of anyone returning from the ski trip who are displaying symptoms that would cause us to have any concerns.""

What is the official advice to schools?

PHE's medical director Prof Paul Cosford acknowledged schools had to take ""difficult decisions given the complexity of the issues that they're facing"".

""Of course, schools have difficult decisions to take - a whole range of issues to take into account and we are able to talk to them about their specific circumstances and help them make the right decisions for them,"" he said.

""But what I would say is that our general advice is not to close schools.""

Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""no blanket closure"" for schools and the ""goal was to keep schools open"".

""If anyone has been in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or an educational setting, no special measures are required while test results are awaited,"" Mr Hancock told MPs.

""There is no need to close the school or send other students or staff home.

""Once the results arrive, those who test negative will be advised individually about returning to education.

""In most cases, closure of the childcare or education setting will be unnecessary but this will be a local decision based on various factors including professional advice.""

Head teachers in England should contact their regional schools commissioners should they need advice, he added.

Dr Bharat Pankhania, from University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""If you have returned from the area of northern Italy that is currently in lockdown since 19 February, you need to self-isolate, as per the advice from Public health England and the UK government.

""However, there's no need for a school to close. There are consequences to closing schools.

""It's disproportionate and it gives the wrong impression. It makes people extremely concerned, when there's no need to be.""

Official government guidance for educational settings says if a pupil or member of staff is confirmed as having coronavirus, anyone who has been ""in close face-to-face or touching contact, including those undertaking small group work (within 2m [6ft] of the case for more than 15 minutes)"" should self-isolate at home, or within their boarding school dormitory room, for 14 days"".

Does parental pressure affect head teachers' decisions?

Some parents have expressed concern via social media about their child coming into contact with the coronavirus, particularly if fellow pupils have been away in northern Italy.

But while some parents want to see schools closed, others do not want their child's education to be disrupted.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Schools listen carefully to the views of parents and they will obviously have regard to this feedback in making decisions over how to respond to any situation regarding coronavirus.

""However, it is often the case that different parents will have different views over an unfolding event, so school leaders have to take this range of opinion on board, together with the views of other stakeholders, and make a judgement on what response serves the best interests of all pupils and staff.""

Could there be an impact on the exam season?

With the exam season coming up next term, some teachers, parents and young people may be worried about disruption to important exams.

But the exams watchdog Ofqual said it was monitoring the situation closely and students should not be concerned.

""We routinely consider whether there are particular risks to the smooth running of exams and we are working closely with the exam boards and with the Department for Education,"" a spokesman said.

""We will update our existing guidance to reflect any specific arrangements schools and colleges should put in place if required.

""In the meantime, students should continue to prepare for the summer exams as usual and schools and colleges should ensure their contingency plans are up to date.""

Mr Barton added: ""We would urge students who are studying for their exams not to worry about what may or may not happen with regards to coronavirus and to concentrate on preparing for these important qualifications.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,BBC,Health,TRUE
"['Helen Briggs', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A trafficked pangolin in Kuala Lumpur: the animal is a suspect in the outbreak

The race is on to find out how the deadly coronavirus jumped from animals to humans. Helen Briggs looks at how scientists are trying to trace the source of the outbreak.

Somewhere in China, a bat flits across the sky, leaving a trace of coronavirus in its droppings, which fall to the forest floor. A wild animal, possibly a pangolin snuffling for insects among the leaves, picks up the infection from the excrement.

The novel virus circulates in wildlife. Eventually an infected animal is captured, and a person somehow catches the disease, then passes it on to workers at a wildlife market. A global outbreak is born.

Scientists are attempting to prove the truth of this scenario as they work to find wild animals harbouring the virus. Finding the sequence of events is ""a bit of a detective story"", says Prof Andrew Cunningham of Zoological Society London (ZSL). A range of wild animal species could be the host, he says, in particular bats, which harbour a large number of different coronaviruses.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronaviruses under the microscope

So how much do we know about the ""spillover event"", as it's known in the trade? When scientists cracked the code of the new virus, taken from the body of a patient, bats in China were implicated.

The mammals gather in large colonies, fly long distances and are present on every continent. They rarely get sick themselves, but have the opportunity to spread pathogens far and wide. According to Prof Kate Jones of University College London, there is some evidence bats have adapted to the energetic demands of flight and are better at repairing DNA damage. ""This might enable them to cope with a higher burden of viruses before getting sick - but this is just an idea at present.""

There's no doubt that the behaviour of bats allows viruses to thrive. ""When you consider the very way that they live, then they are going to have a large array of viruses,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball from the University of Nottingham. ""And because they're mammals there's a possibility that some of them can infect humans either directly or through an intermediate host species.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most infections are in China but other nations are battling the virus

The second part of the puzzle, then, is the identity of the mystery animal that incubated the virus in its body and possibly ended up in the market at Wuhan. One suspect for the smoking gun is the pangolin.

The ant-devouring scaly mammal, said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world, is threatened with extinction. The animal's scales are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine, while pangolin meat is considered a delicacy by some.

Coronaviruses have been found in pangolins, some claimed to be a close match to the novel human virus. Could the bat virus and pangolin virus have traded genetics before spreading to humans? Experts are cautious about drawing any conclusions. Full data on the pangolin study has not been released, making the information impossible to verify.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Officials seize civet cats in Xinyuan wildlife market in Guangzhou to prevent the spread of SARS

Prof Cunningham says the provenance and number of pangolins examined for the research is especially important. ""For example, were there multiple animals sampled directly in the wild (in which case the results would be more meaningful), or was a single animal from a captive environment or wet market sampled (in which case conclusions about the true host of the virus could not be robustly made)?""

Pangolins and other wild species, including a variety of species of bat, are often sold in wet markets, he says, providing opportunities for viruses to move from one species to another. ""Wet markets, therefore, create ideal conditions for the spillover of pathogens from one species to another, including to people.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Camels can harbour the novel coronavirus, MERS

The market in Wuhan, which was closed down after the outbreak, had a wild animal section, where live and slaughtered species were on sale, including body parts of camels, koalas and birds. The Guardian reports that an inventory at one shop listed live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions, bamboo rats, squirrels, foxes, civets, hedgehogs (probably porcupines), salamanders, turtles and crocodiles.

As far as we know, bats and pangolins weren't listed, but authorities in China will have intelligence on what animals were being sold, says Prof Ball. ""If the spillover's happened once, you want to know whether or not this sort of thing can happen again, because it's important from a public health standpoint,"" he says. ""And so you need to know exactly what species of animal it's in and also what were the risks that gave rise to that spillover event.""

Many of the viruses we have become familiar with in recent years have crossed over from wild animals. This is the story of Ebola, HIV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and now coronavirus. Prof Jones says the rise in infectious disease events from wildlife might be because of our increasing ability to detect them, growing connectivity to each other, or more encroachment into wild habitats, thereby ""changing landscapes and coming into contact with new viruses the human population hasn't seen before"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bats being sold at an Indonesian market this month

If we understand the risk factors, we can take steps to prevent it happening in the first place without adversely affecting wild animals, says Prof Cunningham. Conservationists are at pains to point out that although bats are thought to carry many viruses, they are also essential for ecosystems to function. ""Insectivorous bats eat huge volumes of insects such as mosquitoes and agricultural pests, while fruit bats pollinate trees and spread their seeds,"" he says. ""It is imperative that these species are not culled through misguided 'disease control' measures.""

After Sars in 2002-3, caused by a very similar coronavirus to the one now emerging in China and beyond, there was a temporary ban on wild animal markets. But the markets quickly sprang up again across China, Vietnam and other parts of south-east Asia.

China has again suspended the buying and selling of wild-animal products, which are commonly used for food, fur and in traditional medicines. Reports suggest this may be made permanent.

While we may never know exactly how or where the disease responsible for many deaths made the leap into humans, Prof Diana Bell of the University of East Anglia says we can prevent another ""perfect storm"". ""We are bringing together animals from different countries, different habitats, different lifestyles - in terms of aquatic animals, arboreal animals and so on - and mixing them together and it's a kind of melting pot - and we've got to stop doing it.""

"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']","Image caption Steve Walsh, 53, was infected with the virus in Singapore before bringing it into the UK

There were 12 days between Steve Walsh leaving a business conference in Singapore and finding out he had been infected with the new coronavirus. When he was tested, he did not even have any symptoms.

But it was still enough to set in train a series of events that have left health officials battling to stop the disease - now named Covid-19 - from spreading across the UK.

The 53-year-old had stopped over for four days at a French ski resort to see friends on his way back from the business conference. Unbeknown to him, he was spreading the virus as he went.

By the time he alerted the NHS and Public Health England (PHE), after being contacted by Singaporean authorities about the spread of coronavirus at that conference, he had already passed it on to 11 other Britons at the resort.

Five of them were also back in the UK by this stage - and two were GPs.

Between the six of them, they had come into contact with hundreds of people around Brighton and East and West Sussex before being isolated, giving the virus a real opportunity to get a foothold in the UK and marking the first major test of PHE's infection containment plans.

Mr Walsh, of course, was not the first person in the UK to have been diagnosed with the virus. But the previous two - both Chinese nationals who were in York - had had limited contact with others.

The race to contain the virus

PHE's containment strategy was quickly put into action in both cases. Local PHE staff - there are nine teams across England - were sent to interview the confirmed cases to quickly piece together their movements.

It is a process being repeated in London following confirmation of the ninth UK case, a Chinese national.

This is called contact-tracing and has meant scores of people are being asked to isolate themselves at home. This self-isolation - different from the quarantining of British nationals repatriated from China - lasts until it is clear they are not going to get ill, which can take two weeks.

The hope is this stops the further spread of the virus - because there is no vaccine or cure, containment is the only option.

The rough rule of thumb means anyone who has had physical contact with the carriers or spent 15 minutes within 6ft (2m) of them is contacted and self-isolation considered.

That includes people who were within two rows of them on the flights into the UK and, in the case of Mr Walsh, bar staff in pubs where he had stopped for a drink and members of a yoga class he had taken part in.

For the doctors - both GPs by training - it has involved patients.

Between them, they had done shifts at an accident and emergency unit and two GP practices as well as carrying out a visit to a nursing home.

The fact doctors have become infected is, in many respects, the ""worst-case scenario"" for health officials as the virus is known to be most risky to the frail and vulnerable.

The only silver lining, according to those involved in the hunt for contacts, is they do not seem to have treated that many patients.

PHE believes only about a dozen people were seen by the two doctors during the shifts they did. At one practice, the GP only did paperwork.

Image copyright PA Wire Image caption County Oak medical centre in Brighton was closed for cleaning on Monday

Those patients and many others now face an anxious wait to find out if they have been infected. The standard procedure is to wait to see if symptoms develop before testing - a negative test during the pre-symptomatic phase can be misleading.

But many in East and West Sussex have already been tested - as have others across the UK who have come in on flights from China, including those in quarantine in Milton Keynes and Merseyside, and those who had contact with the Chinese nationals in York. In total, more than 1,700 tests have been carried out.

Has the virus been contained?

PHE medical director Paul Cosford says the system of contact-tracing, isolation and testing is the best way of stopping the spread of the coronavirus.

He describes it as ""incredibly robust"" as shown by the fact the other Britons infected by Mr Walsh were found through the contact-tracing process

""That suggests it is working. If we can identify cases early, we can stop the spread.""

But is this really realistic? At Britain's airports, flights coming in from at-risk countries, which include Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand, are being closely monitored.

Passengers are warned about which symptoms to look out for and given leaflets on what to do if they develop them, while captains have to sign declarations no-one is known to be ill on their flights.

Prof Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, says despite this, it will not be possible to catch every case, predicting that, for every one that gets caught, another two could slip through.

Those in the business refer to it as fires and sparks. Each carrier is a fire letting off sparks that may generate other fires. If those fires are detected, they can be isolated before letting off too many sparks.

But if they are not, the sparks breed new fires, leading to the risk of rapid sustained transmission.

A long way to go yet

Ministers and senior officials involved in containing coronavirus accept more UK cases will be likely, including, perhaps, transmission within the UK rather than just cases imported from abroad.

That in itself will not spell the end of the attempts to contain it. It is only when there are five, six or seven links in the chain of transmission that health officials would concede containment is no longer realistic and instead focus all efforts on NHS contingency planning to cope with the surge in patients that would follow.

At the moment, there is only one link in the chain - Mr Walsh to the others on the ski holiday.

If containment fails - and chief medical officer Prof Chris Witty is adamant that is still an if, not a when - then the longer it can be delayed the better position the UK will be in because more would be understood about the way the way the virus works and there is hope that in warmer weather it may be harder for it to spread.

The biggest concern now in the UK and abroad is what will happen if the virus starts spreading rapidly in nations other than China in the coming weeks.

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this would have the potential to ""create havoc"".

This is because countries with weak health systems would find it more difficult to contain the spread and the nature of global travel and movement means even countries with sophisticated and developed surveillance systems would find it difficult to keep the virus at bay.

,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption As the virus spreads, preventative checks are taking place around the world

The coronavirus outbreak has been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

It is a term that the organisation had refrained from using before now.

WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was now using the term because of deep concern over ""alarming levels of inaction"" over the virus.

What is a pandemic?

A pandemic describes an infectious disease where we see significant and ongoing person-to-person spread in multiple countries around the world at the same time.

The last time a pandemic occurred was in 2009 with swine flu, which experts think killed hundreds of thousands of people.

Pandemics are more likely if a virus is brand new, able to infect people easily and can spread from person-to-person in an efficient and sustained way.

Coronavirus appears to tick all of those boxes.

With no vaccine or treatment that can prevent it yet, containing its spread is vital.

Why is the term being used now?

At the end of February, Dr Tedros said while coronavirus ""absolutely"" had pandemic potential it was not there yet because ""we are not witnessing uncontained global spread"".

What has changed is the number of countries dealing with cases. There have now been 118,000 in 114 countries.

Changing the language does not change anything about how the virus is behaving, but the WHO hopes it will change how countries tackle it.

Dr Tedros said: ""Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve.""

He added that the WHO was asking all countries to:

activate and scale-up emergency response mechanisms

communicate with people about the risks and how they can protect themselves

find, isolate, test and treat every Covid-19 case and trace every contact

"['The Visual', 'Data Journalism Team', 'Bbc News']","Coronavirus - a fast-moving infection originating in China - has spread to more than 140 countries and claimed more than 5,700 lives.

While more than half the cases are in China, the virus is now spreading faster outside the country than within. Italy, so far, has the highest number of confirmed infections outside China.

This series of maps and charts will help you understand what is going on.

1. The virus outbreak is now a pandemic

A rise in the number of daily confirmed cases of the new coronavirus internationally has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare its spread a global pandemic.

This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time.

About 81,000 people in China have been diagnosed with coronavirus since its emergence in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, in December.

But there are now also about 71,000 confirmed cases outside China, according to the latest WHO figures.

However, the number of people with coronavirus internationally is thought to be a much higher number - as many of those with mild symptoms have not been tested and counted.

After China, Italy has the highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 21,000. Europe has become the new ""epicentre"" of the pandemic.

Iran and South Korea also have significant outbreaks, with nearly 13,000 and 8,000 known cases respectively.

In response to the virus's spread, countries around the world are ramping up measures to try to slow it down.

Governments have halted flights from virus-hit nations, locked down towns, urged people to stay at home, and suspended major sporting and social events.

US President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency, freeing up to $50bn (£40bn) in relief funds.

He has also announced travel restrictions on European countries. The measures - originally only applying to non-Americans travelling from countries which are members of the Schengen border-free travel area - have been extended to include the UK and Ireland from Tuesday. The restrictions are in addition to those applying to China and Iran.

A number of international conferences and sporting events have also been cancelled, including Six Nations rugby matches.

To better co-ordinate the global response, leaders of the world's richest economies - the G7 group - will hold a crisis summit via videoconference on Monday.

2. Italy has the most recorded cases outside China

Italy currently has the most confirmed cases outside China, having overtaken both South Korea and Iran.

It has more than 21,000 confirmed cases and a death toll of about 1,400.

Italian authorities have imposed stringent restrictions, closing nearly all shops, bars, hairdressers, restaurants and cafes until 25 March.

Schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues have also been shut, and people have been ordered to stay home and seek permission for essential travel.

A number of airlines, including British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair, have cancelled Italy flights until the start of April.

3. Numbers across Europe are also rising

European countries have seen steep rises in infections and deaths, and the region has become the new epicentre of the crisis.

As well as Italy, Spain, France and Germany now have thousands of confirmed cases each.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that up to 70% of its population - some 58 million people - could contract coronavirus.

However, some German virologists dispute the high figure, suggesting a worst-case scenario of 40,000 cases.

In Spain, a state of emergency came into force on Saturday, with Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez warning that the number of confirmed cases in the country could top 10,000 next week.

In the UK, where cases stand at 1,140, the government has told those with a high temperature or new, persistent cough to self-isolate for a week as it steps up its response.

The UK has switched to tactics aimed at delaying the virus's spread, rather than containing it.

4. China still has the most cases

The number of overall coronavirus cases in China has been rising since January, but has been levelling off over the last couple of weeks.

The country still has the highest number of confirmed cases of any country and accounts for about 81,000 of the 152,000 global cases.

Government and regional officials have imposed tight restrictions in a bid to reduce infections, including cancelling flights, closing schools and workplaces and ordering some cities to go into lockdown.

The country is now tightening travel restrictions to try and prevent imported cases, so all international arrivals in the capital Beijing will have to be quarantined for two weeks

There are deep concerns laboratory tests are incorrectly telling people they are free of the coronavirus.

Stories in several countries suggest people are having up to six negative results before finally being diagnosed.

Meanwhile, officials in the epicentre of the epidemic, Hubei province, China, have started counting people with symptoms rather than using the tests for final confirmation.

As a result, nearly 15,000 new cases were reported on a single day - a quarter of all cases in this epidemic.

What are these tests and is there a problem with them?

They work by looking for the genetic code of the virus.

A sample is taken from the patient. Then, in the laboratory, the virus's genetic code (if it's there) is extracted and repeatedly copied, making tiny quantities vast and detectable.

These ""RT-PCR"" tests, widely used in medicine to diagnose viruses such as HIV and influenza, are normally highly reliable.

""They are very robust tests generally, with a low false-positive and a low false-negative rate,"" Dr Nathalie MacDermott, of King's College London, says.

But are things going wrong?

A study in the journal Radiology showed five out of 167 patients tested negative for the disease despite lung scans showing they were ill. They then tested positive for the virus at a later date.

And there are numerous anecdotal accounts.

These include that of Dr Li Wenliang, who first raised concerns about the disease and has been hailed as a hero in China after dying from it.

Image copyright Weibo Image caption Dr Li posted a picture of himself on social media from his hospital bed, on 31 Jan. The next day, he said, he had been diagnosed for coronavirus

He said his test results had come back negative on multiple occasions before he had finally been diagnosed.

Chinese journalists have uncovered other cases of people testing negative six times before a seventh test confirmed they had the disease.

And similar issues have been raised in other affected countries, including Singapore and Thailand.

In the US, meanwhile, Dr Nancy Messonnier, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says some of its tests are producing ""inconclusive"" results.

What might be going on?

One possible explanation is the tests are accurate and the patients do not have coronavirus at the time of testing

It is also cough, cold and flu season in China and patients may confuse these illnesses for coronavirus.

""The early signs of coronavirus are very similar to other respiratory viruses,"" Dr MacDermott says.

""Maybe they weren't infected when first tested.

""Then, over the course of time, they became infected and later tested positive for the coronavirus. That's a possibility.""

Another option is the patients do have the coronavirus but it is at such an early stage, there is not enough to detect.

Even though RT-PCR tests massively expand the amount of genetic material, they need something to work from.

""But that doesn't make sense after six tests,"" Dr MacDermott says.

""With Ebola, we always waited 72 hours after a negative result to give the virus time.""

Image copyright Getty Images

Alternatively, there could be a problem with the way the tests are being conducted.

There are throat swabs and then there are throat swabs.

""Is it a dangle or a good rub?"" asks Dr MacDermott.

And if the samples are not correctly stored and handled, the test may not work.

There has also been some discussion about whether doctors testing the back of the throat are looking in the wrong place.

This is a deep lung infection rather one in the nose and throat.

However, if a patient is coughing, then some virus should be being brought up to detect.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronaviruses are named for the tiny ""crowns"" that protrude from their surface

A final option is the RT-PCR test for the new coronavirus is based on flawed science.

In order to develop the test, researchers must first pick a section of the virus's genetic code.

This is known as the primer. It binds with the matching code in the virus and helps bulk it up. Scientists try to pick a region of the virus's code they do not think will mutate.

But if there is a poor match between the primer and the virus in the patient, then an infected patient could get a negative result.

At this stage, it is impossible to tell exactly what is going on so lessons for other countries are unclear.

""It is not going to change that much,"" Dr MacDermott says.

""But it flags up that you have to test people again if they continue to have symptoms.""

"['Kate Scotter', 'Bbc News']","Image caption Personal trainer Emily Barclay went from triathlon training to ""needing a snooze every day""

At 39, Emily Barclay was hit with irregular periods, crushing fatigue and mood swings. It took four years before she was diagnosed with perimenopause - a phase that can last for 10 years before the menopause itself, with similar debilitating symptoms.

""Everything was just wrong.""

That's how Emily felt when she started gaining weight, feeling exhausted all the time and ""totally out of control"".

She couldn't understand it - she was fit, healthy and training six times a week for long-distance triathlons. But within three months, she went from preparing for Ironman events to ""needing a snooze every single day"".

The personal trainer went to the doctor several times over the following four years and was repeatedly given conflicting advice.

""I just wasn't getting any answers. I was told I was stressed, that they needed to change what [contraceptive] I'm on, I needed to exercise more, I needed to lose weight.""

Image copyright Victor Ling Image caption Emily says not knowing what was wrong made her feel ""out of control""

Emily says not knowing what was wrong with her was ""scary"" and that every couple of months, she would have ""episodes"" where she didn't feel like herself.

""I didn't understand what was happening and I was really scared about why I wasn't me any more,"" she says.

""I had episodes of just being psycho... It wasn't just being a bit ratty but proper angry and I would keep going back for arguments. Then afterwards, I would feel totally wiped out.

""It was terrifying, as I felt totally out of control. It's like you've been body-snatched and you're watching another person.""

Emily had ""endless"" hormone tests that all came back normal. She ended up conducting her own research and told the doctor she thought she either had chronic fatigue syndrome or perimenopause.

Together, they identified that her symptoms seemed to run in conjunction with her menstrual cycle and at 42, she was finally diagnosed with perimenopause - a phase that can last up to 10 years and cause hot flushes, night sweats and mood swings, similar to the menopause.

""I didn't know perimenopause even existed [but] I felt such a relief because I now knew what was going on,"" she says.

""I didn't know there was this transition, I just thought you toddled along happily and one day you had a few hot flushes, your periods finished and you were done.""

Image copyright Family photo Image caption The personal trainer regularly went swimming, cycling and running before the onset of symptoms

For most women in the UK, the average age of reaching the menopause is 51, but decreasing levels of oestrogen can cause perimenopausal symptoms.

Emily struggled at first with the impact of the condition. She had been used to training for 12 to 15 hours a week through swimming, cycling and running, but felt too tired to exercise - something that had brought her social benefits as well as fitness.

Many of her friends were from the Norwich-based triathlon club Tri-Anglia and the Bungay Black Dog running club, so she saw them less frequently.

She also didn't finish the 2017 Outlaw Half Holkham - an event consisting of a 1.2-mile (1,900m) swim, 56-mile (90km) bike and 13.1-mile (21km) run - due to her symptoms and she pulled out of Ironman Vichy in France as the distances were double and she felt ""there was simply no point"" going.

""A huge part of [training] was socialising and catching up with people; I would run with one of my friends which was an opportunity to chat and I would do long runs with my dogs,"" she says.

""I felt lost not being able to do that.""

What is perimenopause?

The time from when a woman first starts to develop the physiological changes associated with menopause, to 12 months after her last period

The average age of menopause in the UK is 51 - perimenopause usually starts between two and eight years before this but can start even earlier

Symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, anxiety, low mood, poor concentration, low libido, headaches, crawling-skin sensation, and changes in menstrual cycle

For most women diagnosis should be based on symptoms. Hormone blood tests can be misleading as hormones fluctuate significantly during this time

The most effective treatment is hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

Other treatment includes cognitive behavioural therapy, acupuncture, antidepressants, and the anti-epileptic drug gabapentin

Herbal options include black cohosh, ginseng, evening primrose oil and sage

The 43-year-old decided not to take medication and instead adapted her lifestyle to ""allow for fatigue"". Cardiovascular exercise still ""wipes me out for days"" so instead she has taken up power-lifting.

""Now I know what it is, I feel happy to ride it out,"" she says. ""I don't take PT clients in the evening any longer, I allow time for naps, I make sure I get early nights when I need to.""

She has also channelled the years she spent trying to get answers into an online support service called Perimenopause Hub, where women with the condition all over the world can find out more about symptoms and get support.

It has a Facebook group with more than 1,200 members and experts on hand to give advice. Emily, who says the project has ""grown and grown"", will also be hosting a three-day online summit on 20-22 March.

""The feedback has been phenomenal. People have been in contact and said they feel they are 'no longer alone', 'I'm not different', 'I'm not the only one going through this',"" she says.

The mental health charity Mind says it is signposting people to street drug charities to help them withdraw from antidepressants because of the lack of alternatives available. Those affected can experience debilitating symptoms.

""The withdrawals are far worse than the original depression, for me and so many other people.""

Stuart has tried to stop more than 10 times, but has struggled with what he calls his withdrawal ""hell"" - and has now had to stop working.

He says doctors have advised him to take anything between ""a few weeks"" to three months to slowly stop using the drugs.

But he believes people coming off anti-depressants are being ""abandoned by the system"".

Image caption Mind's Stephen Buckley says it is not fully understood how difficult a process coming off anti-depressants can be

While antidepressants are not addictive, just over half of those who stop or reduce their dosage experience withdrawal symptoms, according to one review of 24 studies last year.

The mental health charity Mind's head of information Stephen Buckley says it is having to signpost patients to street-drug charities, even though they have been prescribed the drugs on the NHS.

Street-drug charities usually help those misusing alcohol and illegally-obtained drugs.

""The process of withdrawing from something like a street drug and withdrawing from a medicine is not that dissimilar,"" he says.

""It's not really well understood how long and how difficult a process coming off anti-depressants can be.

""If you've been prescribed and been on a medicine for about six months, we might think that it'll take you another six months to successfully reduce and come off that medicine.

""It's not a process that for most people can be done really quickly.""

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises doctors to gradually reduce anti-depressant dosages over a four-week period.

But, it adds, some patients will need longer to adjust and updated guidelines are expected to come out later this year.

The Royal College of Psychiatrists, meanwhile, says the fact some patients who stop or reduce their dosage experience significant withdrawal symptoms ""needs greater recognition"" within the health service.

Prescriptions for anti-depressants in the UK have doubled in the past decade.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in a statement that he was ""determined everyone has access to excellent mental health care"".

""Anti-depressants have a place but they must be used with caution,"" he said.

""Our world-class medical staff have the skills and training to ensure they can diagnose accurately and decide on the best treatment plans.""

Back in Worcester, Stuart is getting ready to welcome other people withdrawing from prescription drugs at his monthly support group.

He decided to set it up after finding it difficult to get support when he began trying to withdraw.

""I made a self-referral to the local substance misuse charity,"" he says, ""but then I was told it was only for people that was abusing the medication, which I wasn't, so there was no service available.""

""It was really an acute need, and those needs aren't being met by services.

"['Edward Main', 'Bbc Ouch']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ‘We accidentally posted a video about diabetes, and it went viral’

When best friends Ellen Watson and Beth McDaniel posted a TikTok video of themselves getting glammed up for a night out, they had no idea they were about to become a viral sensation.

Overnight, a video of them dancing around racked up 500,000 views - not because of their outfits or before-and-after hair and make-up transformation, but because the Northern Irish students happily showed off their wearable blood glucose scanners which help them manage their type 1 diabetes.

Rather than conceal the small white discs under clothing as many people do, Beth and Ellen displayed them on their bare arms and pointed to them as they danced.

The video propelled them into the social media stratosphere and the Diabetic Duo was born.

""It's just been crazy,"" Ellen, 19, told the BBC Ouch podcast. ""I think it was because people had seen it and they were tagging their diabetic friends going: 'Isn't this what you have in your arm?'.

""Even non-diabetic people were commenting: 'What is this? Why do you have this in your arm?' So it did cause a lot of conversation.""

Image copyright Diabetic Duo

The scanners Beth and Ellen wear help them to track their blood sugar levels by taking glucose readings from interstitial fluid - a thin layer of fluid that surrounds the cells of the tissues below the skin. Those readings can be scanned using a mobile phone and the results shared with anyone who needs to know.

It's an alternative to the more traditional finger-prick test which relies on drawing blood, and which can be painful and numb the fingers.

People who wear the monitors often hide them under their clothing because they prefer to manage their condition quietly but Beth and Ellen choose to be open about it on their chosen site TikTok, mostly known for videos which last just a few seconds.

The majority of clips on the platform feature lip-synching to pop videos, dancing or visual gags, so the pair have to get creative when it comes to getting a medical lifestyle message across.

In a video about taking insulin, the Diabetic Duo filmed themselves injecting in unusual locations - standing at the top of a human pyramid, hula hooping, in front of a police riot van, and all to the soundtrack of the Bee Gees song Stayin' Alive.

Image copyright Diabetic Duo Image caption Getting the point: Beth and Ellen filmed themselves self-injecting in unusual places

In another video Beth and Ellen, both from Banbridge, County Down, don glasses and suits, and take on the role of stern diabetes nurses who tut over their own blood sugar levels.

As well as enjoying their moment in the spotlight, the pair find relief in being able to take a light-hearted look at a serious illness.

Ellen was diagnosed at age six after her mother, a nurse, spotted the main symptoms, known as the Four Ts: Extreme Thirst, losing weight and getting Thin, needing the Toilet and Tiredness.

Then, last August, Beth's 12-year-old sister was diagnosed. Eight days later, in an unexpected coincidence, Beth, 20, became unwell and was also found to have type 1 diabetes. Her blood sugar levels had sky-rocketed to 20 whereas a non-diabetic result would be between four and seven.

What is diabetes?

Image copyright Getty Images

Despite being caused differently, all forms of diabetes have one thing in common - too much sugar, or glucose - in the bloodstream.

The levels of glucose are normally controlled by the hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas.

If you have type 1 diabetes, your body cannot make insulin. It is a serious, lifelong condition that is treated by injecting insulin.

With type 2 diabetes, your insulin is not working effectively, or you cannot make enough. It can often be treated with lifestyle changes and medication, and sometimes it is possible to reverse the condition.

Without treatment and management, diabetes can have long-lasting health impacts - including eye problems, kidney issues, increased stroke risks and nerve damage.

Close friends Beth and Ellen were known by those around them as the Iconic Duo. When Beth revealed she too was diabetic, Ellen says: ""My mum dropped the washing basket and I burst into tears."" She gave Beth a card to cheer her up and wrote ""We're the Diabetic Duo now"".

Beth says ""It just kind of stuck. We were like, 'Oh my goodness, this was meant to happen'.""

She says they were not trying to make a point about diabetes when they started posting videos together, but the audience quickly zeroed in on the topic and the response has been positive.

Cox2be2013 posted: ""My 10 year old son Ellis (diagnosed 2 years ago) loves your videos and said 'I wish this was me'."" While Ben_1671 says: ""You have encouraged me to feel more normal.""

Image copyright Diabetic Duo Image caption In one video the duo watch in dismay as their blood sugar levels slump after a drink

Ellen says: ""I really identify with some of the young people messaging us. What I would have done to have two girls like Beth and I to look up to.""

She found her diagnosis easy to handle as a child, but as a teenager felt very self-conscious.

When she started secondary school she hid the fact she took insulin injections by doing them under the canteen table and sometimes did not eat so she didn't have to inject. ""That's so dangerous,"" Ellen says. ""I do not recommend that at all.""

Having the support of each other has helped them grow in confidence as they manage the lifelong condition.

Beth, who was diagnosed last year, says having a supportive and knowledgeable friend in Ellen, and making videos which are popular, has helped her come to terms with the condition.

""If I didn't have all this hype and glamour around me would I have dealt with it as well?""

According to Diabetes UK, people with diabetes are twice as likely to experience depression than those without the condition and , after a diagnosis, the focus on food, weight and body image, can trigger eating disorders - something both women are conscious of.

The duo agree that the feedback has given them a positive outlook, and the success has spurred them on to make more videos.

They are aware their videos may appear frivolous to some but believe their message on the reality of living with diabetes cuts through the noise on social media because of their frank take on it.

They hope that by making diabetes more visible - and having a laugh while doing it - they can continue to break any stigma around the condition, and help others feel less socially isolated.

""It's very light-hearted, you know, and that's what we're trying to do because then non-diabetic people want to watch it too,"" Beth says. ""It's lifelong. You just got to embrace it and get on with it.""

The students have now found themselves juggling their studies with the increasing media attention to their online activities.

So what does the future hold for the Diabetic Duo?

""We just want to keep making videos and working away at uni and just seeing where it all takes us,"" Ellen says. ""We really would love in the future to become like the female Ant and Dec.

""That's the dream.""

"['Kate Scotter', 'Bbc News']","Image caption Louise Goldsmith started to lose her hearing when she was at primary school

For seven years of her life, Louise Goldsmith experienced life with sound. Then her hearing mysteriously started to deteriorate. Now 25, she's on a mission to show that life with hearing loss can be lived to the full.

At first Louise, was ""excited about having hearing aids"" and would ""show them off"" to her classmates at primary school.

But things changed when she got to senior school, where her peers were unkind and would bully her.

Louise, from Melton, Suffolk, says she would conceal her hearing aids by wearing her hair down and her confidence became ""really bad"".

But since going to City College Norwich, she says she has worn her hearing aids ""with pride"".

""My bad experiences make me want to help others. I face daily barriers. I want people to see that deaf people aren't people with two heads, they are normal people,"" she says.

Image copyright Louise Goldsmith Image caption Louise says she now wears her hearing aids with pride

Louise's bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is now classed as severe to profound, and she relies on two hearing aids and lip reading.

No-one else in her family is deaf, and genetic testing has revealed no clues as to why she lost her hearing.

She says the challenges she faces on a daily basis include services where she needs to use a phone, a lack of subtitled films at cinemas and people who work in public-facing roles not knowing how to react when she says she's deaf.

Louise says the challenges she faces have made her more determined to help others and raise awareness.

""I've had so many things happen,"" she says. ""One time I went to go on the park-and-ride and this bus driver made me cry.

""I didn't hear him and he was really horrible and it was really embarrassing.

""Mum wrote a letter to complain and they apologised but it's bad experiences like that, you think, 'this can't happen again' - you have to do something about it - so that's why I do what I do.""

Louise works as an outreach officer for Deaf Blind UK, a job she says she thought she'd be good at as ""I know everything there is to know about being deaf"".

She also hopes to inspire ""young people to realise it's fine to be deaf and it's nothing to be ashamed of"".

Image copyright Louise Goldsmith Image caption Louise says her deafness can make others feel awkward

Louise says there needs to be more awareness among those who work with members of the public.

""Like in shops, for example, if I don't hear how much money I have to pay, the specific change, I ask them to repeat again but sometimes I don't hear the last bit, and I tell them I'm deaf and then they have this face of shock, and you know they feel awkward.

""People need to understand there's different levels of deafness,"" she says.

In addition to her job at Deaf Blind UK, Louise campaigns for improved services for deaf people, is an ambassador for Relay UK, an app that helps deaf people make phone calls, and is a volunteer Action on Hearing Loss.

As part of her crusade, Louise has set up her own website, is active on social media, gives presentations and makes YouTube videos.

Image copyright YouTube/Louise Goldsmith

Some people's responses to deaf people can be ""cringey"" or funny - and some can be downright offensive, Louise says.

So she created a list of ""Things Not to Say to a Deaf Person"" on her YouTube channel, including:

""Wow, you speak so well for a deaf person""

""Can deaf people drive?""

""Oh my best friend's sister's neighbour's dog is deaf too""

""Does that mean you use Braille?""

""Do you really have to have subtitles?""

""I couldn't live without my music""

""I don't think I could live with being deaf""

""You don't look deaf""

On Twitter, she talks about the realities of life as a deaf person, from how tiring lip reading can be, to her joy at being able to make a vet's appointment over the phone for the first time for her pet hamster.

She also shares images and videos of herself enjoying nights out with her hearing friends, going to the gym, embarking on a charity skydive and her journey of learning sign language.

Image copyright Abi May Image caption ""Being deaf does not actually suck""

In her YouTube videos, she goes on adventures with a friend who is also deaf.

The pair can be seen having fun at outdoor activity centre Go Ape, taking a trip to Ikea and go-karting with friends.

""Being deaf does not actually suck - if I wasn't deaf I would not have met the wonderful people in this unique deaf culture,"" says Louise.

""Over the years I've learnt that we are actually experts in adapting to different circumstances and we can still actually enjoy life without sound.""

A paediatric nurse who appealed for knitted sleeves for premature babies says she now has more than enough - after receiving 48 sackfuls in a week.

Catherine McConville, of the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, asked knitters to create tiny cannula covers for babies in her neo-natal unit.

The online appeal went viral with close to 100,000 shares in just a few days.

She estimated there were ""potentially a thousand in each sack"" and will offer the surplus to other units.

Mrs McConville, who works in Charles Wolfson Ward with premature babies at the maternity hospital, originally requested a few extra sleeves to cover the intravenous tubes on babies' arms to stop them scratching themselves.

Image copyright WARM BABY PROJECT Image caption The charity has been inundated with the tiny knitted squares

She asked Olivia Cundell, creator of the Warm Baby Project, to help her spread the word by posting on the project's Facebook page.

The post read: ""We have lots of babies receiving IV antibiotics and use little knitted tubes to cover the cannulas.

""They are single patient use and we never have a good supply. I have written some instructions and would be so grateful for your help.""

The appeal generated offers from Dubai, the United States and Australia, although the sacks are filled with UK-made sleeves.

Mrs McConville, a mother of four, said processing the volume of donations has been ""quite a task"".

""It has had quite a positive psychological benefit for the parents too, who are often quite scared to look at their babies or handle them - this helps,"" she said.

Mrs McConville's unit now has enough hand-knitted sleeves and the surplus will be offered to other neo-natal units that need them.

She said all the donated items had been washed before being taken to the ward and used on any baby.

Ms Cundell, who set the project up two years ago, said there had been a significant rise in offers of wool, materials and monetary donations, as well as people offering their craft skills.

""A lot of people out there do just want to help,"" she said.

"['Jane Wakefield', 'Technology Reporter']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK

An ambitious project to develop a wearable device to detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease has been launched.

The Early Detection of Neurodegenerative diseases (Edon) is being spearheaded by charity Alzheimer's Research UK.

It will initially analyse data from continuing studies into the disease, using artificial intelligence.

And this data will be used to design a prototype device within three years.

Wearables collect a variety of data including gait, heart rate and sleep patterns and the hope is by analysing this data, researchers can begin to map signs of the disease years before symptoms develop.

'Memory tests'

The global initiative has already won funding from tech founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates.

But it also forms part of the UK government's wider ambition to use artificial intelligence and data to help better understand and prevent chronic diseases.

Initially, EDoN will work with the UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, The Alan Turing Institute, to trawl through data from continuing studies into Alzheimer's disease.

Prof Chris Holmes, health programme director at the institute, said: ""Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the learning opportunities from large-scale data studies such as Edon by integrating information from multiple sources.

""We will use AI to deliver new insights into the early signals of disease by combining digital data measurements with traditional sources such as brain imaging and memory tests.""

'Digital fingerprints'

There are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK, according to Alzheimer's Research UK.

And globally, the number is expected to increase from 50 million in 2018 to 152 million in 2050.

Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""Developing digital fingerprints that can be detected using phone apps or wearable technologies like smart watches would provide a low-cost approach to identifying those most at risk of disease.

""Identifying the very earliest changes in these diseases would transform research efforts today, giving us the best chance of stopping these diseases before the symptoms of dementia start to get in the way of life.""

Volunteers to wear the device and share their data will come from another ambitious UK health project, the Accelerating Detection of Disease Programme.

Launched last year as part of the government's mission to transform the diagnosis of disease using data and AI, it aims to recruit five million volunteers.

"['Vanessa Clarke', 'Bbc News']","Image caption Jazz is using exercise to help her recovery

Excessive use of painkillers is on the rise. Now the NHS in Sunderland, which has one of the highest prescribing rates, is running a campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of long-term use.

Jazmine Allen, 23, who already has a 10-year history of using prescription painkillers, is taking part in the 'Painkillers Don't Exist' campaign - which aims to raise awareness that the medications can simply be masking the pain rather than ""killing"" it - and encouraging patients to seek support from their GPs.

Jazz began taking opioids as a teenager, after surgery for hip dysplasia brought her serious, chronic pain.

But when she went to university, she realised the pain medication was becoming more of a problem than the pain itself. And it was consuming her life.

""I was a child. I was put on this through no fault of my own, and coming off it was a million times harder than any of the surgery stuff"", she says.

""I was so tired and drained and I was so dependent on them.""

Her GP suggested she went to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre in Leeds, which dealt with people coming off high-dose opioids for methadone to help her come off her prescribed medication.

But she decided it was ""ridiculous, treating an opioid with an opioid"". She opted to come off her painkillers, and uses exercise to manage her symptoms instead.

'North-South divide'

At the University of Manchester, a team has been studying the increasing prevalence of painkiller use.

Dr Li-Chia Chen has been looking at opioids, and more recently the rise of gabapentin and pregabalin (medications used to treat nerve pain).

Her findings on both show a similar picture - that the poorest communities have the highest dependency on pain relief.

Image copyright University of Manchester Image caption Prescriptions for gabapentin and pregabalin have risen steadily over the last decade.

""There is a very clear North/South divide"" she says.

""In more deprived areas there are more people in labour-work type of jobs. They may damage themselves so they have more muscular skeleton conditions, and lower back pain.

""But the other thing is how they access their healthcare, so maybe healthcare demand is high but healthcare provision is not sufficient to care for those patients.""

Public Health England data, published last year, showed 540,000 people in England have been taking opioids, gabapentinoids or benzodiazepines for three years or more, risking overdose and dependence.

Doctors know painkillers can be of huge benefits to some patients. Research suggests just one in 10 patients seeking help for long-term pain, benefit from strong painkillers.

'Is something else going on?'

But Dr Siara Malik, who is helping run the Sunderland campaign, says they're working hard to reduce long-term use.

""We need, as clinicians, to be chasing up our patients to see why the pain is persisting.

""For patients to be aware if they are taking if for that long, they need to be asking why am I taking it, is there something else going on, is it masking a problem that needs further attention?""

Image caption NHS Sunderland is running a campaign aimed at long-term users of painkillers

Following the Public Health England report, the All-Party Parliamentary Group for prescribed drug dependence called for a national 24-hour helpline providing withdrawal support, tapering, and drug information for patients, their families and doctors.

They have also recommended dedicated withdrawal support services working with GP surgeries to help identify patients, and provide advice and support, as well as better provision of alternatives to pain killers.

Prof Peter Kinderman, who is on the group, says action is needed now.

""There is general acceptance we have a problem, I think we also agree on what the solutions are. The real next step is government implements the recommendations rather than say there is a problem.""

NHS England and NHS Improvement are considering the recommendations from the review, including the recommendation for a helpline.

The government stresses painkillers are essential to help people manage pain, but they must be treated with caution.

There had been widespread speculation about the fate of the conference as the world battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Avoiding large gatherings is a key part of much public health advice.

Attendees in previous years have come from all over the globe. Apple says its developer programme includes 23 million people in 155 countries.

Last year's conference saw two major hardware announcements: a new Mac Pro, and the high-end Pro Display XDR monitor. The event also showcases new features coming to Apple's software, such as iOS and macOS.

Security experts say a spike in email scams linked to coronavirus is the worst they have seen in years.

Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance.

Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found.

The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns.

1. Click here for a cure

Image copyright Proofpoint Image caption Victims looking for a cure face having personal details stolen

Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments.

The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time.

""We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click,"" says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team.

Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day.

""It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals,"" says Ms DeGrippo.

The best way to see where a link will take you is to hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal the true web address. If it looks dodgy, don't click.

2. Covid-19 tax refund

Image copyright Mimecast Image caption HM Revenue and Customs is not trying to give you a Covid-19 tax rebate

Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours.

If a member of the public clicked on ""access your funds now"", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information.

""Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email,"" says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. ""And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund.""

3. Little measure that saves

Image copyright Proofpoint Image caption The World Health Organization is being impersonated by many hacking campaigns

Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread.

""This little measure can save you,"" they claim.

But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger.

This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online.

To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice.

4. The virus is now airborne

Image copyright Cofense Image caption Hackers are using fear-mongering tactics to encourge clicks and downloads

The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission.

It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool.

Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers ""weaponising fear and panic"".

It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic. Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account.

Cofense says the combination of a ""rather good forgery"" and a ""high stress situation"" make for a potent trap.

One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account.

5. Donate here to help the fight

Image copyright Kaspersky Image caption The CDC is not asking for donations in Bitcoin

This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing.

Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware.

President Trump had previously expressed concern about Amazon's bid.

In a court filing, the Pentagon said the U-turn was ""in response to.... technical challenges presented by AWS"".

Microsoft said it ""remained confident"" its bid was ""technologically superior"".

In a statement, it said: ""We believe the Department of Defense made the correct decision when they awarded the contract.

""However, we support their decision to reconsider a small number of factors as it is likely the fastest way to resolve all issues and quickly provide the needed modern technology to people across our armed forces.""

Amazon said it was pleased that the DoD had acknowledged the ""substantial and legitimate issues"" with the award decision.

The Pentagon has requested 120 days to reassess the award - its filing was based on pricing and not whether President Trump had interfered in the process.

In July last year, President Trump began questioning whether the process was fair, telling reporters he was getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and Amazon"".

He has previously criticised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - who owns the Washington Post.

Only Microsoft and Amazon bid for the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure (Jedi) contract and the latter had been seen as the favourite to win.

The new system is designed to replace the DoD's ageing computer networks with a single cloud system, which will host classified secrets and provide artificial intelligence-based analysis to the military.

They said although none of the activity focused on elections or political candidates, the network had requested to run political ads there.

Twitter said the accounts attempted to ""sow discord"".

An investigation by Facebook, in conjunction with CNN, found some accounts posted as a charity based in Ghana.

The troll factory was run from the headquarters of Ebla (Eliminating Barriers for the Liberation of Africa), near Accra, according to the investigators.

Others posed as blogs or posted in Facebook groups. All of the fake accounts focused on topics such as black history, fashion, celebrity gossip, US news and LGBTQ issues.

They shared negative content about police brutality and oppression. One account posed in a Facebook group as the cousin of an African American who died in police custody, according to CNN.

Facebook said the accounts were relatively new and operating out of Africa on behalf of Russian individuals with links to notorious troll factory the Internet Research Agency.

It said its systems had rejected the requests to run political adverts in the US, and it has taken down 49 Facebook accounts, 85 on Instagram and 69 other pages.

These had about 278,000 followers, with around 65% of these based in the US.

Twitter also removed 71 accounts that had 68,000 followers. It said that the accounts had ""attempted to sow discord"" with conversations about race and civil rights.

Apple has reopened all of its Chinese stores, a month after shutting them down amid the coronavirus outbreak.

All 42 official Apple retail stores opened on Friday, although some stores had special business hours.

It shut the stores in mid-February, as China put several cities on effective lockdown in a bid to contain the virus.

The outbreak has slashed demand for new phones, with Apple selling less than half the iPhones it sold in February last year.

There have also been concerns about the supply of phones for Apple and other manufacturers, as many Chinese factories which make phone parts shut down for weeks.

Foxconn, which assembles Apple's phones in huge factories, said employees had returned to work in numbers that ""exceeded our expectations and imagination"" - and that supplies of parts had returned to normal, too.

But it had its largest drop in revenue in about seven years during the closures.

Apple, meanwhile, sold roughly 494,000 iPhones in China in February - compared to 1.27 million in February 2019.

China recorded just 19 new infections on Tuesday. President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, in a high-profile visit covered by state media.

Facebook is already working with researchers at Harvard University's School of Public Health and the National Tsing Hua University, in Taiwan, sharing anonymised data about people's movements and high-resolution population density maps, which help them forecast the spread of the virus.

The social network is also helping partners understand how people are talking about the issue online, via tools such as Crowdtangle, which aggregate social-media posts.

British start-up Exscienta became the first company to put a AI-designed drug molecule to human trials earlier this year.

It took just 12 months for algorithms to create it, compared with four to five years for traditional research.

AI could be used in three ways in the current crisis, according to chief executive Prof Andrew Hopkins:

to rapidly develop antibodies and vaccines for the Covid-19 virus

to scan through existing drugs to see if any could be repurposed

But he warned people to be realistic about what AI could achieve.

""The fastest this could be done is 18 to 24 months away, because of the manufacturing scale-up and all the safety testing that needs to be done,"" he said.

Google-owned AI company DeepMind, meanwhile, has used its AlphaFold system to release structure predictions of several proteins associated with the virus.

These have not yet been experimentally verified but DeepMind hopes this will help the scientific community's understanding of how the virus functions.

Scientists at both DeepMind and Exscienta praised the way those at the forefront of the outbreak had so quickly released data, which would be crucial for any algorithms searching for a cure.

Internet companies must do more to tackle ""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuse on their platforms, a UK-held inquiry has concluded.

The panel also said the technology companies had ""failed to demonstrate"" they were fully aware of the number of under-13s using their services and lacked a plan to combat the problem.

It has called for all images to be screened before publication.

And it said more stringent age checks were also required.

'Reputational damage'

Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were identified as the most commonly cited apps where grooming was said to take place.

And the industry at large was accused of being ""reactive rather than proactive"" in response to the issues.

""Action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children,"" the inquiry said.

The report follows a series of public hearings, between January 2018 and May 2019, during which the police said they believed the UK was the world's third biggest consumer of live-streamed child sex abuse.

'Evil crime'

Facebook was one of the first to respond.

""[We] have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions,"" said its European head of safety, David Miles.

""As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe.""

Microsoft also promised to ""consider these findings carefully"", while Google said it would keep working with others to ""tackle this evil crime"".

Illegal imagery

The report said some steps should be taken before the end of September.

Leading its list is a requirement for screening before images appear online.

The report noted technologies such as Microsoft's PhotoDNA had made it possible for pictures to be quickly checked against databases of known illegal imagery without humans needing to look at them.

But at present, this filtering process typically happened after the material had already become available for others to see.

Officially banned

Users might be frustrated by a delay in seeing their content go live but, the panel said, it had not been told of any technical reason this process could not happen before publication.

The inquiry also said the UK government should introduce legislation to compel the companies involved to adopt more effective checks to deter under-age users.

Pre-teens were at ""particularly acute"" risk of being groomed, it said.

The panel recognised many services were officially banned to under-13s.

Child nudity

But it said in many cases, the only test was to require users to fill in a date-of-birth form, which could easily be falsified.

""There must be better means of ensuring compliance,"" it said.

The report acknowledged detecting and preventing the live-streaming of abuse was difficult but highlighted a French app as an example to learn from.

It said Yubo used algorithms to detect possible instances of child nudity, which a human moderator would then check to see if action if necessary.

Image copyright Yubo Image caption It was suggested the big social networks could learn from a smaller rival, Yubo

The panel also noted existing anti-abuse technologies did not work when communications were protected by end-to-end encryption, which digitally scrambles communications without giving platform providers a key.

The inquiry highlighted WhatsApp and Apple's iMessage and FaceTime already used the technique by default and Facebook intended to deploy it more widely soon.

However, it did not say how this should be addressed.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51851921,BBC,Tech,TRUE

Amazon workers can take unlimited sick days this month - but only those in quarantine for the Covid-19 virus will be entitled to extra sick pay.

Many US warehouse workers are entitled to only 10 days' leave a year - for all holidays, sickness and emergencies.

And some had asked Amazon to change its policy to stop coronavirus spreading.

Some workers also say they are being told increase their hours, known as mandatory extra time, because of increased demand and staff shortages.

'Financial distress'

In a blog, Amazon said: ""The health and safety of our employees and contractors around the world continues to be our top priority as we face the challenges associated with Covid-19.

""Effective immediately, all Amazon employees diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed into quarantine will receive up to two weeks of pay.

""This additional pay while away from work is to ensure employees have the time they need to return to good health without the worry of lost pay.

""This is in addition to unlimited unpaid time off for all hourly employees through the end of March.""

Amazon has also established a $25m (£19.6m) fund to support independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants and seasonal employees ""under financial distress"".

BBC News has had access to an online forum used by about 25,000 Amazon warehouse workers.

And some of those unaffected by coronavirus are clearly relieved they will no longer have to struggle into work when either they or their family are sick.

""My two kids have been sick and last night I felt like death. Now, I can take time off and help the three of us to get better,"" wrote one.

Another said: ""It's allowing me to take a break and get my blood pressure down. My vision started to get blurry... my blood pressure was 176/100[mmHg].""

Those who test positive for the virus will now be guaranteed two weeks' pay.

And one Amazon warehouse worker told colleagues on the forum, the company's previous policy of not offering sick pay had been dangerous.

""Many co-workers live pay cheque to pay cheque and are still going to come into work even if they're sick, which means that coronavirus will spread like wildfire through Amazon, just like all the other sicknesses do,"" they wrote.

One in four US workers - more than 32 million - is not entitled to paid sick days and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics that rises to seven in 10 among low-paid workers.

And even before the coronavirus crisis, Amazon workers had begun to demand better conditions, with more paid time off (PTO) being chief among them.

In some facilities, workers have begun wearing badges saying: ""Amazonians united for PTO"".

""Amazon thinks we're just some stupid workers. But we know our rights, we're organising and we're winning,"" one worker, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51832894,BBC,Tech,TRUE
"['Kevin Peachey', 'Personal Finance Reporter']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Digital money would be denominated in pounds, like banknotes

The Bank of England is considering the introduction of electronic banknotes for use by consumers and businesses.

Governor Mark Carney said: ""We are in the middle of a revolution in payments,"" saying the Bank must look into how electronic money could work.

He said this would complement, not replace, paper banknotes while people still wanted physical cash.

But it could open the door to programmable money to integrate with home appliances or the tax system.

Banknotes have been the only way for households to make payments with central bank money for 300 years, a discussion paper published by the Bank says.

The total value of banknotes in the UK economy was close to an all-time high, but people had been making fewer payments in cash, the Bank said.

The governor said fintech firms had begun to offer new forms of money and new ways to pay with it, but it was important to have currency from a trusted central bank.

So, the Bank is considering a Central Bank Digital Currency, which would be denominated in pounds sterling, just like banknotes. So £10 of the digital currency would always be worth the same as a £10 note.

This system would be different from money held digitally in a bank account, or cryptocurrencies. It would be guaranteed by the Bank, rather than a commercial business.

The idea also suggests that consumers would be able to pay for things without all the data about their transactions going to their bank. There would be some anonymity, as there is with cash.

Loading Central Bank Digital Currency would be an electronic version of withdrawing banknotes from an ATM. The Bank stressed this would not replace cash, particularly for those who prefer to use it.

""As long as demand for cash remains, the Bank is committed to meeting this demand,"" the Bank's discussion paper says.

The currency would also be separate from card payments, meaning it would not be affected by technical failures at Visa, Mastercard, or other payment networks.

Payments of the future

The introduction of a digital currency could lead to ""programmable money"", when payments could be integrated with appliances at home or tills at the shops.

Tax payments could be routed to HM Revenue and Customs at the point of sale, the Bank said.

Other examples are shares automatically paying dividends directly to shareholders, or electricity meters paying suppliers directly, based on the amount of power used.

It could also help with very small payments at a lower cost than now, allowing payments such as for a few pence each time to read individual news articles, rather than signing up to a monthly subscription.

Other central banks around the world are investigating the option of issuing digital currency. Interested parties are being invited to respond to the Bank of England's discussion by 12 June.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51851523,BBC,Tech,TRUE

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced the 20% tax on e-books and online newspapers, magazines and journals will be abolished on 1 December.

But the BBC has learned that it will not apply to audiobooks, something that the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said was ""disappointing"".

A letter calling for the tax to be axed was signed by more than 600 authors and presented to Parliament in October.

Physical books and periodicals are already exempt.

In October 2018, the EU allowed member states drop sales taxes on electronic publications and many countries have already made the changes.

""The government expects the publishing industry, including e-booksellers, to pass on the benefit of this relief to consumers,"" the Budget states.

RNIB's head of social change, Sarah Lambert, said it was disappointing that the tax break was not being extended to audiobooks.

""Today's change recognises the unfairness of taxing some alternative formats and will help widen access for blind and partially sighted people who use e-Readers.

""However, for many people living with sight loss, audiobooks are their preferred format and allow them to enjoy their favourite titles in the same way as everyone else. It's not right that they will continue to be charged 20% more for books and we urge the government to make sure that audiobooks are included in the exemption.""

Publisher 404 Ink tweeted the ""huge"" decision would allow it to sell e-books from its website again.

Jim Waterson, media editor at the Guardian newspaper, estimated the move could benefit News UK - publisher of the Sun and Times papers - by £20m, if it kept the cost to consumers the same rather than passing on the saving to subscribers.

A 2018 report by the Publishers' Association estimated universities, libraries, government departments and the NHS would save up to £55m a year as a result of ditching VAT on digital publications.

In response to the news, it said: ""We are delighted that the government has decided to zero-rate VAT on digital books and journals in the Budget. It's fantastic that the Chancellor has acknowledged the value of reading.

""The decision to axe the reading tax will bring an end to the illogical and unfair tax on those who need or prefer to read digitally and should contribute to an increase in literacy in the UK.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51832899,BBC,Tech,TRUE
,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption E3 2019 saw thousands of people flock to the LA Convention Center

The world's biggest gaming event, E3, has been cancelled over fears surrounding the spread of coronavirus.

The event, due to take place 9-11 June in Los Angeles, had been highly anticipated, ahead of PlayStation and Xbox console launches later this year.

Organisers said it had been cancelled ""after careful consultation"" over ""the health and safety of everyone in our industry"".

And they were ""exploring options"" for an ""online experience"" in June.

""This might lead to some permanent change to events like E3,"" said Piers Harding-Roll, from Ampere Analysis.

Such major expos ""were already struggling to define themselves in the rapidly changing landscape of games"" he said.

""Next year, E3 may well be quite different.""

The hype train derailed

Analysis by Marc Cieslak, gaming reporter

Got a new game to tell people about? Do it at E3. Got a new console to flog? E3 is the first stop the hype train calls at.

Over the course of its life, E3 has morphed from a trade-only event that helped retailers to figure how many physical copies of a game they wanted to buy, into a circus of organised chaos.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Monster Hunter photo booth in 2019 attracted plenty of attention

In recent years, the public has been allowed in, hoping to catch a glimpse of (or spend hours queuing to play) a pre-release game demo on the show floor. Multi-million dollar press conferences became the norm.

But industry observers have suggested that E3 has struggled to remain relevant in the last few years.

Opening up to the public was part of an attempt to regain some former glory. But the harsh reality is that E3 is an expensive show to exhibit at, costing many millions of dollars for those that do.

Some big brands would rather create their own events, promoting only their own products - a trend that doesn't look like it's going away any time soon.

Sony, which is launching its Playstation 5 console in time for the Christmas season, had already decided not to attend, for the second year in a row.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gamers play together on the show floor at E3 2019

Nintendo has also shifted to making its announcements in a global online live-stream - but, like many developers, it has maintained a presence at E3 for hands-on demonstrations.

Those are open to the public - and often involve game controllers being passed from person to person as thousands mingle on the show floor.

Microsoft's Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, tweeted that while the company had planned on appearing at E3, it would now hold a digital event.

Latest casualty

Dozens of major technology events have been cancelled in recent weeks as the virus has spread around the world and public health officials have warned people against gathering in large numbers.

The Game Developers Conference, SXSW, Mobile World Congress, and Google and Facebook's major conferences are among the casualties.

Major events that have yet to be cancelled include:

Bafta Games Awards: The British Academy awards ceremony, on 2 April, in London

The British Academy awards ceremony, on 2 April, in London WWDC: Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, on 3-7 June, in San Jose, California

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, on 3-7 June, in San Jose, California NAB: The annual broadcaster and media trade show, on 18-22 April, in Las Vegas,

Other events, such as the Ted talks series, have been postponed or shifted online.

'Upload demos'

The gaming media was left frustrated with organisers after the personal information of more than 2,000 journalists was published on E3's website last year.

And, on Wednesday, gaming journalist Laura Kate Dale tweeted: ""With last year's E3 scaring away press... many publishers [are] likely to learn this year how cost-effective live-streamed events can be.

""I wouldn't be shocked if we look back at 2020 as the year E3 died.""

Meanwhile, Brian Crecente, a former games journalist turned consultant, said: ""Why not have E3 without the E3?""

"['Adrienne Murray', 'Technology Of Business Reporter']","Image copyright La Voix du Nord Image caption Toilet queues spurred Nathalie Des Isnards to start her company making women's urinals

A few years ago, Nathalie Des Isnards was attending a music festival with her husband David, and planning to watch her favourite group.

Before the show, they headed to the toilets. ""I spent 30 minutes in the queue waiting to pee,"" she recalls. Much to her frustration, she missed the first part of the concert.

Meanwhile David took just ""two minutes"", and saw the whole show.

""I was upset. I told myself, 'We're in the 21st century, something should be done about that.'""

She set about creating a women's urinal. The simple seatless basin she devised is housed in a cubicle with roof and door, designed for faster use but also privacy. ""I was not a designer. I was a user first,"" says the 46-year-old.

Despite innovations such as hers, women continue to face queues because, in Nathalie's opinion, ""Up to now, nobody has cared"".

However, thanks to social media, and growing competition between event organisers, she thinks the issue is getting more attention.

""[It] forces them to offer better services,"" she explains. Also, organisers now realise, when women are queuing, they're not spending money.

Des Isnards says 100,000 women used madamePee last year, at 15 events across France, including the Women's World Cup. ""It fits all women, not only young ones open to innovation.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption MadamePee hopes women's urinals will lead to shorter queues at events such as festivals and marathons

Two units have been also been installed in Paris as public amenities, she says. This year the loo will be in several other countries.

""The ambition is very clear. It is to make it standard that each time you have urinals for men, you have a urinal for women,"" says the French entrepreneur.

Even newer designs are aiming the trip to the loo even quicker.

Copenhagen-based architects, Gina Périer and Alexander Egebjerg have designed Lapee. It's a female toilet consisting of three squat-urinals, moulded from bright pink, recyclable plastic.

""It's just insanely more efficient,"" says Ms Périer, 25.

The idea came to them while volunteering at the famous Roskilde music festival. ""I couldn't imagine going to a festival or a sport event without male urinals being everywhere,"" says Mr Egebjerg, 29. ""There's absolutely no reason that women shouldn't have urinals as well.""

Image copyright Eric Delafosse Image caption Lapee is 'insanely more efficient' say its creators

According to their research, 90% of toilet queues are women needing only to urinate.

The team claim Lapee takes only 30 seconds to use, compared to one to two minutes for a regular cubicle. A 1,100 litre tank stores waste liquid underneath, allowing for about 3,500 visits. There are no doors, but the curved walls screen users from view, while encouraging quick use.

Getting women accustomed to urinals is one challenge, but Gina says women have welcomed their design. ""We received a huge amount of posts on Instagram with very thankful messages,"" she tells me.

Lapee debuted at three Danish music festivals last summer, including 48 units at Roskilde. They've been used since at marathons and other events in Denmark, Norway, Australia and France. Toulouse deployed them on city streets during the Rugby World Cup and over new year.

Ms Périer says Lapee is also targeting, ""public spaces and any kind of gathering where toilets are pressured.""

The start-up has partnered with rental services firms to deploy Lapee in several European countries this year.

They're also exploring using the waste-liquid for fertiliser and electricity production.

More Technology of Business

Other urinal products have launched with varying success.

Perhaps best-known, SheWee, has been on the market almost two decades. The funnel-shaped device enables women to pee standing up.

Sam Fountain says her invention was first greeted with a mix of scepticism and joy. While it isn't mainstream, the British firm says it has sold millions worldwide to outdoor enthusiasts, international military, people with health conditions, and charities for refugee camps.

""The field of sanitation and toilets management is really under-prioritised,"" says Christian Pagh. He and two other designers created a four-urinal toilet, called Pollee, in 2011. But after weighing up market size and manufacturing costs, they didn't develop it further.

Mr Pagh now collaborates with madamePee.

Gail Ramster, a senior researcher at the Royal College of Art's Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, is sceptical about female urinals.

""It's quite a change in our habits to start using urinals,"" she says. Factors like clothing and privacy could be issues for some women.

""Some people have used them at festivals and they have some success, but whether they can become widespread enough in those situations, or more extensively, I'm a little doubtful.""

Image copyright MadamePee Image caption Research suggests women take up to twice as long to use toilets

Women typically take longer in the toilet because of biological, societal and practical factors, such as menstruation, childcare or different clothing. Often this isn't addressed when toilets are planned.

""We take 1.5 to two times as long as men to use the toilet. But rather than receiving 1.5 to two times more toilets, we actually receive fewer,"" Ms Ramster says.

""Men's and women's toilets are often built to the same square footage, but because you can fit more urinals in that space, men have more fixtures to use, usually, than women do.""

Researchers from Ghent University simulated the waiting times for six different toilet layouts. They found that boosting the number of female facilities relative to men's (unsurprisingly) cuts women's queuing times.

But the best option was to install gender-neutral cubicles, with optional urinals for men, which delivered even greater time savings for women.

""For the unisex scenario, there's higher utilisation of your resources and inevitably leads to less waiting,"" says Professor Wouter Rogiest, one of the study's authors. ""This [also] caters for the needs of transgender [people].""

It could be that the answer to those endless queues is not different women's toilets, but simply more of them.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51293676,BBC,Tech,TRUE
"['Dougal Shaw', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']","Image caption Jake Sweet, also known as the Tiktok star Surfaceldn

When I meet up with Jake Sweet (aka Surfaceldn on TikTok), he's buzzing.

He's about to be flown out to the MTV Video Music Awards in Spain as a special guest. Dinner will be laid on, he explains, and there will be aftershow parties where he will rub shoulders with music's biggest stars - but best of all, says the 21-year-old, he will hang out with other social media influencers he admires.

He got his invite because he has just over three million followers on the TikTok video sharing app (more than twice as many as pop star Dua Lipa). His presence at the event will boost its profile, as well as his own.

But once the party's over, it will be back to Earth with a bump. He will return to lectures at the University of Nottingham.

When not working towards his degree, Jake makes fun, craft-based videos on TikTok, with a sideline in pranking. For instance, he once surprised his brother by filling his duvet with popcorn.

But he's best known for customising trainers, and for his tricks with orbeez, colourful pellets that change size in water.

He started on TikTok just to have fun with his friends back in November 2018. His videos achieved tens of thousands of views almost immediately, so he threw himself into it.

Now meet Felicity Harfin (aka @refelicity) and her boys.

Image copyright Harfin Family Image caption The Harfin family Tiktok stars

Felicity lives in Edinburgh and works in marketing - or at least she used to.

She discovered TikTok last year and decided to make some fun videos. Things really took off when she included her two sons.

Over summer she did a ""prank-a-day"" marathon called ""Taking revenge on my kids"". This included pretending to trap her hand in a car door and tricking them into smearing baked beans on their faces.

Half-way through the series, her videos were consistently getting two million views, and one achieved 13 million.

She now has 1.8 million followers and TikToking has practically become her full-time job.

TikTok is a Chinese-owned social media app that allows you to share short videos. The international version of the app has more than one billion users. In 2019 it was the second-most downloaded app globally, after WhatsApp.

The platform is owned by ByteDance and morphed out of the lip-syncing app Musical.ly. Music remains an important part of the experience - posts can be set to snippets of the latest commercial releases.

What sets TikTok apart from other social media platforms is the way it finds videos for you. As well as seeing videos posted by friends, users are recommended videos by the company's software algorithm.

Unlike Facebook, which recommends content based on your friends' activity, TikTok delves deep into users' behaviour on the app to figure out their tastes. Make the right kind of content and you can potentially reach millions of eyeballs.

And this explains a big reason for TikTok's appeal. In theory anyone can become ""TikTok famous"" - you don't have be a reality-TV star, or celebrity sportsperson to make viral videos.

Add to the equation the app's hashtag challenges and the experience becomes like a talent show.

On established platforms like YouTube and Instagram, influencers have made millions through advertising revenue and paid promotions. So can everyday influencers who crack the TikTok code make money, considering its vast reach?

Image copyright other Image caption Jake filled his brother's duvet in one popular prank video

Jake earns a small but steady income from TikTok which helps him at university - it's enough for things like groceries. But most of the money he makes gets spent on props for his next videos, he says.

Doing several videos a day is time-consuming - even his 15-second videos can take up to an hour to record. He has to put in an ""extra shift"" to make sure his university studies don't suffer.

But he gets lifestyle perks like party invites, and the experience of being a social media celebrity.

""I do get some money through promotions,"" he explains. ""I've done work with people like Amazon Music, rappers Trippie Redd and Juice Wrld.""

""They say we need you to promote this song, by doing a video along these lines, and then I put my own creative interpretation into it.""

Image copyright Harfin Image caption A memorable Harfin family video involved pretending to trap Felicity's hand in a car door

Jake gets his paid work through a company called Fanbytes, one of the digital agencies which have sprung up to service influencers.

Well-known early agencies of this kind include OP Talent, set up in 2012, which signed gaming star KSI, and Gleam Futures, which snapped up YouTuber Zoe Sugg.

Timothy Armoo founded Fanbytes in 2017 with fellow computer scientists he met at university.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Timothy Armoo of Fanbytes explains how his success is grounded in a love of maths

The company is busy signing up Snapchat and TikTok users, with a focus on ""Gen Z"" and the 18-21 market. It uses in-house algorithms to predict whose followings are about to take off.

Its software also measures who can persuade their followers to click on links - this is known as ""conversion ability"".

After that, some old-fashioned human decision making comes into play.

""We want people who can deliver what we call 'advertainment'"", explains Armoo. This is a seamless mixture of fun and paid-for content, while maintaining what he describes as a ""boy- or girl-next-door quality"".

Armoo has hooked influencers up with brands like Deliveroo, but also the government, who wanted his help to spread the word about the national minimum wage to a BAME audience.

Shauni gets recognised by young teenagers in the street all the time thanks to her work on TikTok, where she has 3.2 million followers.

She joined the app's predecessor, Musical.ly in 2016. Within five days her videos were getting 10,000 likes and she immediately saw the potential, she says.

You can see why her videos appeal to a young audience. Many are like playground games and include fun pranks, tricks to impress friends, dances, or skits about love and relationships.

TikTok now provides her with enough money to live on, plus the ability to indulge her habit of clothes shopping - but less than you might think, given the size of her fanbase.

Sara McCorquodale, who runs an influencer intelligence platform called CORQ which tracks TikTok trends, agrees the platform is a tricky financial proposition.

While she predicts that brands will be spending more money on it this year, the model for rewarding influencers will have to be different to YouTube or Instagram, because ""short-term trends dominate what is popular as much as individual personalities"".

""It's like the internet before Facebook, it's fast-moving and unpredictable.""

Image copyright other Image caption TikTok stars Shanae and Renae are launching a lip gloss product

TikTok is busy moving into the mainstream with an advertising campaign, and expanding its community management operation in London. It will have to manage its influencers' money-making activities more carefully as it gets more attention.

""If you make sponsored content you have to do it explicitly and if the brand or influencer doesn't, they can get sanctioned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA),"" says Ms McCorquodale. ""Even if you are wearing a piece of clothing that is a gift, that has to be made clear.""

Not all influencers on TikTok are following these rules at the moment, and Instagram influencers have recently been banned for being irresponsible and for not being up front about product promotion.

Image caption Sara McCorquodale runs a social media influencer intelligence agency

TikTok says that ""every video posted as an advertisement is reviewed by us to ensure it is compliant with the ASA guidelines"".

It also says it regularly shares the ASA guidelines with creators, and that if an influencer indicates a video is sponsored, it will automatically be posted with ""#ad"" displayed.

TikTok has fallen foul of influencer behaviour before. Last year it was forced to apologise for the way some stars exploited young fans for financial gain through ""digital gifts"", with influencers themselves calling for more guidance from the app.

TikTok's growing prominence has also seen it face closer scrutiny over issues that affect all social media platforms like user privacy and personal safety.

It was fined in the United States for holding data on children under 13 and more recently faced criticism for the meme known as the skull-breaker challenge.

Charities have also called for it to do more to prevent the grooming of young children.

Jake plans to complete his degree and then pursue a full-time career as a social media influencer, focusing on TikTok.

""I want this to be an occupation for me,"" he says. Meanwhile, he is simply enjoying the interesting opportunities it brings.

The student's next engagement is a party to celebrate the launch of a new shoe, which he will of course be TikToking about.

When one of Louise Halford's staff members returned from a ski trip with flu-like symptoms, she advised him to work from home rather than risk bringing the coronavirus into the office.

Ms Halford also decided to work from home after feeling some possible symptoms as well.

""We work with someone who has a compromised immune system, so I don't want to take any chances,"" says Ms Halford, co-founder of Manchester-based Evolve Family Law.

Around the world, millions of other people have also been told to stay at home in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19.

That includes Apple where the chief executive Tim Cook told staff, ""feel free to work remotely if your job allows"".

Amazon and Google have similar policies in place.

""Employers are definitely taking this seriously,"" says Hannah Ford, a partner and employment law expert at law firm Stevens & Bolton.

Keeping in touch

Communicating with colleagues is crucial, which is why remote meeting services are in high demand.

In China, up to 22 times as many people are using Cisco's Webex videoconferencing service since the coronavirus appeared.

Like several of its competitors, it has upgraded its free service in response to the surge in demand.

Anyone signing up to its 90-day free plan can therefore benefit from unlimited usage, while the maximum number of participants is now 100, up from 50.

Rival Zoom also has a free video-conferencing plan. Its free tier allows unlimited one-to-one meetings, as well as group sessions lasting up to 40 minutes and involving 100 participants.

More Technology of Business

Staying secure

Those new to working from home present a juicy target for hackers, who will no doubt sense an opportunity to steal sensitive information, or commit online fraud.

To keep information secure most companies will use a virtual private network (VPN) to create an encrypted connection from the user's computer to their company IT system.

However, even businesses with a quality VPN may need to buy more user licences or improve the server capacity for everyone to use it at once.

""Companies are increasingly stress-testing their servers to ensure they will cope with everyone working remotely,"" Ms Ford says.

Another option would be to control your work computer from home using remote desktop software.

You might even want to use both bits of tech, which would provide a secure way to access your work computer.

If you are going to work from home, you might want to check that your internet connection is reliable.

Self-employed accountant Elizabeth Stanley's advice for anyone who may have to self-isolate is therefore to ""get your internet connection and security sorted now"".

""It's worth checking your home broadband provider allows you to connect to a VPN as this varies between providers, packages, and areas,"" says Ms Stanley, who is based in Newport, South Wales.

If not, you may need to upgrade, or invest in a mobile hotspot or router.

Anyone who collaborates with colleagues in different locations has probably used documents shared over the internet.

Slack, for example, is a secure instant messaging platform that offers file sharing and video calls and wants ""to replace email"".

It has around ten million users, including Sam O'Connor, co-founder of London-based banking app Coconut.

""Slack is a really good way of keeping in touch with everyone when you are working remotely,"" he says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Slack hopes to replace email with its collaborative work software

Slack's advice for users forced into quarantine includes setting up an Announcements channel that is read-only for most people but that administrators and managers can use to post important information.

It also recommends using the app's custom statuses to let colleagues know when you are on a call or away from your desk, and sketching out ideas on paper before taking a photo with your phone - rather than spending time and energy creating a slide.

But Slack is just one of many such apps.

Other options include Microsoft's Teams platform.

Part of Office 365, Teams' free version supports up to 300 participants and offers guest access, one-on-one, and group video and audio calls, as well as file and screen sharing, and online document collaboration.

And for businesses requiring more services, Microsoft too has responded to the current epidemic by offering a free six-month trial of the paid version, including full meetings, collaboration and workflow capabilities.

"['Will Smale', 'Business Reporter', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption Andrew Rickman today runs Rockley Photonics, which specialises in designing and producing next-generation, optical computer chips

The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to UK technology pioneer Andrew Rickman.

How would you feel if you lost more than £1.4bn ($1.81bn) almost overnight?

That was the situation faced by Andrew Rickman back at the end of 2000, when the dotcom bubble spectacularly burst, sending shares in his company Bookham Technology plummeting.

""It was like a nuclear winter,"" he says looking back.

Andrew had set up Bookham in 1988 in the kitchen of his home in Wiltshire, when he was 28. It grew to become one of the world's leading providers of optical components for the telecommunication and computer industries. In very simple terms, its technology allowed data to be transferred very quickly using lasers and glass fibres.

By the late 1990s its sales were booming as more and more homes and businesses were being connected to the internet, and mobile phone networks were being rolled out.

Image copyright Andrew Rickman Image caption Andrew says his previous wealth was widely reported in UK newspapers

The good times were, well, so good, that after Bookham floated on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in April 2000, within two months it had joined the FTSE 100 index. This is the list of the 100 firms on the exchange with the largest market capitalisation - the combined value of all their shares.

Such was the surge of Bookham's share price that Andrew, who owned the largest stake in the business, became the UK's first technology billionaire. This sent the UK's tabloid newspapers into a frenzy, and the softly spoken, modest 40-year-old was suddenly a reluctant celebrity.

Journalists excitedly told their readers that he was richer than Queen Elizabeth II and Sir Paul McCartney combined. Looking back, he says he was ""embarrassed"" by all the coverage.

At the peak of Bookham's share price in the summer of 2000, Andrew was worth more than £1.5bn. Then the dotcom bubble burst, and before the end of the year Bookham's share price - and Andrew's wealth - had collapsed.

This thrust him back into the papers, which now gleefully reported his downfall.

Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption He predicts that his latest company - Rockley Photonics - could see billions of pounds in annual sales

""I didn't think particularly much about all the press coverage,"" says Andrew, now 59. ""The money wasn't an issue, because it was only on paper. Being the first dotcom billionaire wasn't a reality to me.

""The thing that was difficult to deal with, as a human being, was the massive change of circumstances for the company and our technology. It was an emotionally difficult thing to handle for many different reasons.""

The big problem for Bookham was that its cutting-edge optical equipment was expensive. And after the dotcom bubble burst, its customers - the firms building all the new networks - switched to using cheaper, simpler technology instead.

But before you feel sorry for Andrew, he still had some £50m in his bank account, and he was able to slowly build Bookham back up again. This involved delisting from the LSE, and moving the company to Silicon Valley to get around the then high price of sterling, and be closer to key customers.

Andrew eventually left the business in 2004, to start a new career as a technology investor. Then in 2013 he started his latest business - Rockley Photonics.

Image copyright Miguel Soltero Image caption Andrew now employs a team which keeps a close eye on economic and industry trends

Based in Oxford, with a 150-strong workforce, it designs a product called silicon photonic chips. These are like standard microchips, but with one key difference - they beam light around the chip instead of sending an electronic current.

Although the photonic chip industry is still in its infancy, the advantage is said to be that they can process a lot more data, more quickly. Photonic chips are now increasingly being used in everything from data centres to sensor systems on autonomous cars, and in the latest mobile phones.

Andrew says that Rockley now has an annual turnover in the ""tens of millions"", but with the potential of increasing this to billions.

Veteran electronics journalist Peter Clarke says that Andrew ""is one of a group of UK engineering visionaries that also carry the entrepreneurial gene"".

""Rickman is smart in an intense, academic way, and a good advert for the UK higher education system."" (He was educated at Imperial College in London, and the University of Surrey.)

Looking back on the dotcom bust, does Andrew think he should have predicted it?

""Hindsight is a great thing,"" he says. ""I don't think many people were prepared for that sort of boom and bust, they never seem to be.

""The span of time between boom and busts tends to be sufficient for the collective knowledge to have gone into retirement. But we were one of very, very, very few firms in our area that survived.

""One thing I did learn at that time was to have an eye to a more analytical view of the world around us. So from that point on I've always had what I would describe as an analysis team... They sit there and they basically analyse the environment the whole time, so, if you like, they become a sensitive seismic monitor.

"['Lucy Proctor', 'Bbc Stories']","One day, just after I had dropped my son off at school, I was sent a horrific video on WhatsApp. It made me question how images and videos of child sex abuse come to be made, and how they can be openly circulated on social media. And I wanted one answer above all - what happened to the boy in the video?

It may sound strange, but the woman who sent me the video was a fellow mum at the school gates. A group of us had set up a WhatsApp group to discuss term dates, uniforms, illnesses.

Then one morning, out of the blue, one of these mums sent a video to the group, with two crying-face emojis underneath it.

It was just a black box, no thumbnail, and we all pressed play without thinking. Maybe it would be a meme or a news story. Maybe one of the ""stranger danger"" videos some of the mums had started to share.

The video starts with a shot of a man and a baby, about 18 months old, sitting on a sofa. The baby smiles at the man.

I can't describe the rest.

If I tell you what I saw in the 10 seconds it took to grasp what was happening, and press stop, you'll have the image in your head too. And you don't want it. It's a video of child sex abuse. It's nine minutes long.

I screamed, and threw my phone across the room. It was pinging with messages from distraught members of the group.

I took my phone to the police station. I told them what had happened. I told them I believed the woman had sent it to us as a warning, and that I hoped they would investigate where the video came from. Was it new, or one they'd already come across? Was this little boy still in danger? Could this evidence help save him, or catch the abuser?

The police had my phone for two weeks. I found out the next day that they arrested the woman who sent it and visited other members of the group. And then I didn't hear anything else about it.

But one question stayed with me. What happened to the boy in the video? And so, a few months later, once I could read my own kids a bedtime story without thinking of him and life had got back to normal, I began to look for answers.

I started by trying to speak to the police officer investigating the video on my phone. But every time I called Wembley CID to speak to him, he'd just gone out.

He didn't want anything to do with me.

I checked with Alan Collins, a lawyer who specialises in child sex abuse, to see if any of the things I might normally do to track down people would work. Could I, for example, send former police officers a copy of the video to see if they recognised it?

""You could be looking at a prison sentence of 10 years,"" he told me. Same goes for taking a still and sending that. Just possessing an image like this on my phone could land me in jail.

So I called a friend of a friend who used to work for the police. He told me Wembley CID would have sent my phone off to one of the digital forensics labs spread across the city. The labs list all the illegal content, and when it's child sex abuse they grade it: Category A for the most serious, Cat B, Cat C. This WhatsApp video was Cat A.

Next, the file goes to victim identification and my case was passed to the Metropolitan Police's Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Command. An officer there, Det Sgt Lindsay Dick, agreed to talk to me, but he didn't want to say much about the techniques used in case it helped offenders work out how to evade capture.

An estimated 100,000 men in the UK regularly view child sex abuse

Police arrest between 400 and 450 people a month, men mostly, for viewing or downloading these files

WhatsApp takes down 250,000 accounts every month suspected of spreading child sex abuse material, based on the names of groups and profile pictures

He did tell me about one case, where an officer had got hold of a phone that had images of a boy being abused on it, along with images of the same boy not being abused. In one, he's standing at a bus stop in school uniform. An officer recognised the bus stop as a Mersey Transport sign, and put a call in to the Merseyside team. They recognised the school uniform. The boy was identified, his parents arrested, and social services took over. Victim-identification police all over the world rely on little clues like this.

Lindsay Dick wouldn't discuss the details of what I'd been sent, even though he had investigated the case. Then, when I asked him about a suggestion from an editor to take a still from the video of the perpetrator's face, to help identify him, I started to feel some heat.

""Do you still have a copy of that video?"" he asked me, sternly. ""No,"" I replied. But it was still sitting somewhere on WhatsApp's server, and because I was still a member of the group, it was still showing on my phone. Even though I'd done nothing wrong, I realised how seriously the police took this kind of thing.

This hit home late last year when a senior Metropolitan Police officer, Supt Novlett Robyn Williams, was given 200 community hours' unpaid work and threatened with losing her job for failing to report a video of child sex abuse her sister had sent her on WhatsApp. (She is now appealing against the conviction.)

The Metropolitan Police refused to help me any further in my search for the boy in the video. At one point they even told officers in another part of the country, incorrectly, that I'd been cautioned for sharing the video.

I found out later from the woman who sent the video to me that she had been given three years on the sex offenders register. But the investigating officers at Wembley CID took the case no further - they didn't arrest the friend who had sent it to her, and they didn't even try to find out who had sent it to her friend. Further up that chain of people sharing the video must be some dangerous people, perhaps an abuser. But nothing was done to follow the trail.

The Metropolitan Police says: ""The scale of child abuse and sexual exploitation offending online has grown in recent years. This increased demand on police, coupled with the need to keep up with advancement of technology and adapt our methods to detect and identify offenders, means it is a challenging area for the Met and police forces nationally. However, we remain committed to bringing those who commit child abuse offences online to justice, and safeguarding victims and young people at risk.

""We encourage anyone concerned about a child at risk of abuse or a possible victim, to contact police immediately. Anyone who receives an unsolicited message which depicts child abuse should report it to police immediately so action can be taken. Images of this nature should not be shared under any circumstances.""

I needed someone who wasn't involved with the case to give me some more clues about where this file I'd been sent might have come from. So I started searching, and I came across news articles about a team in Queensland, Australia with a reputation for infiltrating child abuse video-sharing sites.

Their head of victim identification, former Greater Manchester Police detective Paul Griffiths, told me the file I'd been sent had probably started life on one of these sites.

""What tends to happen is that when a file gets produced like that, it generally stays under cover, under wraps, circulating amongst a fairly small, tight network. Very often people who would know that they need to keep it safe and not distribute it widely,"" he said.

These networks of paedophiles use the dark web, a part of the internet that isn't indexed readily by search engines such as Google. They access sites through a connection called TOR, or the onion router. They use a fake IP address, connected to several other servers dotted around the globe, which makes their location untraceable.

Members of these dark web sites are like sick stamp collectors - they post thumbnails of what they have on dedicated online forums, and look to complete series, usually of a particular child.

Some of them are ""producers"" - they abuse the children, or film them being abused.

A couple of years ago Paul Griffiths' team was watching one site called Child's Play. They had intelligence that two of the site's leaders were meeting up in the US. Officers intercepted them, arrested them, and got their passwords.

Now they could see everything - each and every video - and they could get to work finding children and perpetrators. They made hundreds of arrests worldwide, and 200 children have been saved so far.

""It's Sherlock Holmes stuff, it's following little clues and seeing what you can piece together to try and find a needle in a haystack,"" says Griffiths.

The big worry now is live-streaming, where adults can pay to watch children being abused in real time. It's even harder to detect, because no file containing clues circulates, and the platforms are all encrypted. Just as the police and technology get better at finding victims in stills or videos, another threat emerges.

""There's a famous story and it often gets told in relation to this area of crime, in relation to the young girl walking on the beach and there's starfish all over the beach and she's picking the starfish up and putting them back into the sea and a guy says to her, 'Little girl, what are you doing? You're never gonna be able to save all of these starfish.' And she says, 'No, but I'll save that one.' And that's really what we're doing,"" says Griffiths.

""You know, we're saving the ones we can save. And if some magical solution appears somewhere in the future that's going to save all of them, that's going to stop this happening, then that'll be wonderful. But in the meantime, we can't just sit back and ignore what we know is happening.""

Paul Griffiths is part of a small network of people who travel the globe for meetings and conferences on what to do about the huge numbers of videos and images circulating online.

He told me to contact Maggie Brennan, a lecturer in clinical forensic psychology at the University of Plymouth, who has been studying child-sex-abuse material for years. Between 2016 and 2018 she combed through the child-abuse images in a database run by Interpol, to build up a profile of victims.

She found a chilling pattern that suggested the age of the boy in the video I saw is not that unusual.

""Concerningly, there is a substantive, small, but important proportion of those images that do depict infants and toddlers. And we found a significant result in terms of the association between very extreme forms of sexual violence and very young children.""

Like the boy in the video I was sent, most children on the database are white - most likely a reflection of the fact that the police forces contributing to it are from majority-white countries.

There's constant pressure, Brennan says, to quantify the numbers of images or videos that are in existence, and the numbers of victims who are being sexually exploited. But it's impossible. Databases only hold the images that have been found, through police raids or reports. Who knows how many are circulating out there?

Paul Griffiths says it only takes one person to bring a video out of the depths of the dark web and unleash it on the general population.

""Sooner or later it comes into the possession of someone who either doesn't know how to keep it safe and hidden, or doesn't really care. And they spread it wider. It can take a few hours, and it's all over the internet.""

I spoke to one offender who served seven months in prison for viewing child abuse images. He had been offered the files on Skype during an adult online sexual meet-up. He'd opened the first file, seen it was of a child - and carried on opening all 20. Then he tried to share them with someone else. Eventually, the man who sent him the files sent them to someone who told the police. But it's a telling example of how easily files like the one I was sent spread, from the depths of the dark web, on to platforms like Skype, and then to people's phones.

Despite the lack of action taken on my case, the UK policing response to child sex abuse images is one of the most robust in the world.

The Child Abuse Image Database (CAID) has seen huge investment over the last five years. When detectives receive the phone or laptop of a suspect, they can run images on it through state-of-the-art software that checks whether images are new, or already known to police. All police forces are linked up, and the database talks to others around the world.

In the 1990s the Home Office undertook a study of the proliferation of indecent imagery of children. There were less than 10,000 images in circulation then. Now there are almost 14 million images on the UK database.

The levels of depravity in videos and images are getting worse, Chief Constable Simon Bailey tells me. He's been the National Police Chief Council's lead for child protection and abuse investigations for the last five years.

I am expecting a forbidding character when I go to interview him at his Norfolk HQ. What I find is a man at the end of his tether.

""It just keeps growing, and growing, and growing,"" he says. ""And there is an element of, 'These figures are just so huge that just can't be right.' Well trust me, it is right. And if I have one really significant regret around my leadership and our response to this it's that we have struggled to land with the public the true scale of what we are dealing with, the horrors of what we are dealing with. Most people, I would like to think, would be mortified that this type of abuse is taking place.""

Last year, Simon Bailey called for a boycott of tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, until they invest in technology to filter and block these images and videos. The public, including myself, took little notice.

Last year, the robots Facebook deploys to sift through its Messenger service reported 12 million posts containing images of child abuse to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which runs the US database.

So child protection campaigners are horrified at Facebook's decision to start encrypting Messenger over the coming months, because it will mean the platform effectively goes ""dark"" and abusers will be able to share material with impunity.

It will become more like WhatsApp, where end-to-end encryption means no-one except the sender and receiver knows anything about what's in a message.

WhatsApp's encryption works because your phone and the phone of the person you're messaging generate the encryption codes and keys. When the message leaves your phone, it does travel through WhatsApp's servers - but they don't have the keys to decrypt it. The only way robots or artificial intelligence could scan the message would be if it was encrypted after it left your phone. But that would give prying regimes, law enforcement or the tech firms themselves a window into our messages. WhatsApp thinks it would lose customers as a result.

The solution is to do the scanning on our phones.

One way this could be done would be for everyone to download software with a list of all the unique codes of all the known child abuse images and videos. But this would still raise privacy concerns. The tech firms could fiddle with the list of codes to include non-child-abuse images - censorship in other words.

So it would be better if phones could run an algorithm to generate the codes themselves, completely independently from any government or tech company. This is the tricky bit though. No one's invented that algorithm yet.

One expert I spoke to put it like this: ""I wouldn't call it impossible, I'd call it unknown how to do it today."" It would take huge amounts of research and development - but it could probably be done.

The failure by Big Tech to invest in this angers Simon Bailey.

""They hold the key to so much of this. Their duty of care I think to children, they have completely absolved themselves of that.

""The reaction is always, 'Well we're doing our best.' No you're not. You need to do more. You're making billions of pounds in profit. Invest.""

There are high hopes for the UK government's Online Harms White Paper published in April 2019 - a radical proposal for legislation that would see tech firms held responsible for the harm they do. It proposes a new regulator and campaigners hope the resulting bill will include mandatory reporting of any child sex abuse. The results of a public consultation are due soon.

At the moment, the tech firms choose what to tell us. No-one knows, for example, how much Facebook or WhatsApp spend on child protection. Facebook says it has the best artificial intelligence on the market trying to block and filter messages. But the company won't reveal how it works, or how much it costs.

John Carr, who advises governments on child safety online, says this lack of transparency has to end.

""I work with people in these companies all the time, they agree with me on most stuff, they care passionately about protecting children but they don't make the decisions. It's their bosses, typically in California, that decide what happens. People high up in those companies need to feel the heat, they need to feel that their feet are being brought to the fire.""

Of course, I ask to speak to WhatsApp. They say no.

One bright summer day, I finally get a breakthrough in my search for the boy in the video. Simon Bailey's assistant puts me in touch with a senior police officer who opens some doors, and I get a call.

I'm told the boy is alive. He's one of the lucky minority who have been identified and rescued.

The video I was sent is an old one, from America. There are already three versions of it on the UK's CAID database - mine makes it four. Police can't tell me where he is, or what his name is. But they do tell me his abuser is serving a long jail term. It's the news I was hoping for.

And I'm happy to leave it at that. There's one word that has stuck in mind over the months that I've tried to find out more about this case - ""revictimisation"". Each time anybody watches or shares a video of a child being abused, that child is revictimised. And as I get closer to finding the boy, I realise I could end up making a phone call to tell him, out of the blue, that I've seen the video of him. He'd be reminded of the horror. He'd be humiliated. I should just leave him in peace.

But I've learned about a campaign group in the US made up of victims - people filmed by abusers - who want to be found, and heard.

James Marsh, a lawyer who has been representing and campaigning for victims of child sex abuse for 14 years, recently spearheaded a change to the law in America that gives victims a right to a minimum of $3,000 compensation from everyone convicted of viewing or sharing a video of their abuse.

It's called the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 2018, after the three young victims who backed it by writing impact statements for the courts.

""It's only been really very recently that victims have become more empowered to reclaim that space, really trying to assert that this is not a victimless crime, that these are not harmless pictures, and that they have voices that deserve to be heard,"" he tells me.

Voluntary principles

A set of ""voluntary principles"" for the tech industry, designed to counter online child sexual exploitation and abuse was published this week by the governments of the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, after consultations with six leading tech companies.

An accompanying letter acknowledged the industry's efforts, but said there was ""much more to be done to strengthen existing efforts"". It added that the initiative was intended to ""drive collective action"".

The principles include preventing dissemination of child sex abuse material, targeting online grooming, preventing search results from surfacing child sexual abuse, and sharing data about the evolving threat.

Recently a seasoned journalist called him for details about what happened to one of his clients. She was expecting to hear that the abuse involved naked photos. When he told her of the reality of the content of these films - the rape of a small child - she was horrified, and didn't publish the details.

""I think as a journalist you're turning off your readership by including these graphic descriptions. And yet, how else can you accurately report what's happening to bring about meaningful change?""

He says his clients, as they get older, have become frustrated by this squeamishness. ""This is our lived experience,"" they say. ""Face up to it.""

I ask him if he thinks the young man, Andy, from the Amy and Vicky and Andy Act, would be up for talking to me. He agrees to connect us on Facebook Messenger.

And with that, I had found a boy in a video. One who had suffered the same terrible fate as the boy in the video I was sent.

Whatever I might have wanted to ask that boy, I could ask Andy. Did he have somewhere safe to sleep at night? Had he managed to stay safe?

Andy has a warm voice. He's eager to talk, candid and hugely likeable. It's strange, but our conversation is not a miserable one.

He tells me he is in his early 20s. He's been out of jail for six months, which is the longest he's managed since he was a child. Fighting mainly, and robbery. When he was younger he was into drugs - meth, heroin and weed. He's doing well at staying off them now. And he has two children, who he adores.

But he lives in a kind of prison.

""I'm kind of a boring person. I don't really go out much, I stay at home, I kind of live just with my kids, and that's about it.""

Andy lives in constant fear that someone might recognise him from one of the videos his abuser made of him, as the abuse continued until he was 13. If someone so much as looks at him in the street, he worries.

His story starts with his parents' divorce. His mother wanted a male figure in his life, and so when Andy was around seven years old she sent him to a youth programme. The ""mentor"" allocated by the organisation groomed Andy and his family for a few months and took Andy on trips to Las Vegas.

Andy didn't tell anyone when the sexual abuse started, because he didn't want to upset his mother.

""I didn't know how my mom would act about it. I didn't want her to be embarrassed because something had happened to me. I didn't know if it was normal. That's kind of how he made it seem.""

How to get help

If you've been affected by the issues touched on in this story, you can find sources of support on the BBC Action Line

The Lucy Faithfull Foundation works to prevent and tackle child sexual abuse and exploitation

When Andy grew old enough he confronted his abuser, who soon afterwards went on the run to Mexico. Then, one day, the FBI turned up at Andy's high school and knocked on his classroom door. The abuser had got sloppy - he'd sent a video to someone he didn't know, who'd reported him.

""And then they tell me that there's hundreds of thousands of videos and pictures of me out on the web.""

Until that moment, Andy had no idea his abuse had been shared at all, let alone with thousands of people. But despite this shocking news, and the difficulty of telling his mother the truth, Andy agreed to help the FBI lure his abuser back across the border.

""We coaxed him back with a birthday party of mine.

""It was a whole three months, all the way up until my birthday. I talked with him on the phone, like nothing was wrong. He sent me a few packages.""

The FBI officers set up the sting. They showed Andy the route they thought his abuser would take and the location of the planned arrest.

""It was really cool. They caught him a couple blocks from my grandmother's house, pulled him over and arrested him.""

It was one of the best moments of Andy's life.

Like other identified victims in the US, Andy gets a letter every time someone is convicted of viewing or sharing a video of him. He has thousands of them.

He's doing his best to rebuild his life. When he can afford therapy, things are better. His lawyers are working on some big cases, which should bring him more compensation. But it's tough.

""Work is really hard for me. And it's not because I'm lazy or anything. It's mainly the mentality of not being able to trust somebody. I can't let this person in. So I'm really anti-social.""

Andy, like all victims, was incredibly unlucky to fall into the hands of an abuser. Had he not, he thinks he would by now have been the CEO of his father's business.

He is finding purpose and solace in his involvement with Amy, Vicky and Andy's law. The three young campaigners hope to meet up in person soon. In the future, Andy wants to give up his anonymity and go into schools to teach children how to stay safe, and how to tell someone if they are not. He feels an obligation to do it he says.

""You know, I want people to know my story.""

I will never get to talk to the other boy in the video. I hope he's OK. I hope he can rebuild his life - however slowly and imperfectly - like Andy.

I've been able to give you a happy ending. Both Andy and the little boy in the video I was sent have been identified and their abusers are in prison. But this is wildly misleading.

Most of the boys and girls in videos won't be rescued. And without radical reform of the way we manage technology and privacy, videos like the one I saw will keep circulating, and new children will be abused to feed the demand.

"['Chris Baraniuk', 'Technology Of Business Reporter']","Image copyright Tiffany Snowden Image caption The Snowdens can't always charge their car outside their house

They've got the only electric car in the village. Tiffany Snowden and her husband bought their second-hand Nissan Leaf a few weeks ago and love it. It's smooth to drive and, she says, ""It's got quite a lot of power to it"". But there's a problem. It's a pain to charge up.

That's because, in the North Yorkshire hamlet where they live, it's a race home every night to get a parking space outside their house. If they succeed, they can plug the car in to mains electricity overnight. If they fail, the options are limited.

""The closest charging point to us is about 10 miles away,"" says Mrs Snowden.

This is a dilemma that could face an increasing number of drivers. The government says that in just 15 years the only new cars on the market will be fully electric vehicles (EVs) or hydrogen-powered alternatives.

While the number of charging points around the UK has increased by about 50% in the last 12 months, according to statistics from EV charging site Zap-Map.com, there are noticeable gaps in provision around the country.

A recent report from Capital Economics suggested that fleshing out the UK's charging network will cost £45.9bn between now and 2050. There are even fears that the electricity grid won't be able to cope as thousands more EVs get plugged in by their new owners.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of charging points has risen by 50% over last 12 months

Is the UK ready for the electric vehicle revolution, then, or is the whole movement doomed to stall?

The Snowdens are hoping that their local charging problem will have a local solution. The government has allocated £5 million in funding for councils to spend on residential charging points.

However, when Mrs Snowden asked her council about this, a representative told her there was little space in the village for charging bays. Plus, they added that the expense of upgrading infrastructure for such facilities was significant. Improving cabling and substations alone could cost ""upwards of £75,000"", they said.

The representative advised Mrs Snowden to ask whether the local pub could install a charging point instead - because it has parking space available and, potentially, spare electricity.

In the meantime, the Snowdens intend to upgrade their home charging point and will have to carefully plan where they charge up and how they use the roughly 80 miles of range they get with their 2014 Nissan Leaf.

""I think we've kind of gone about it perhaps a bit backwards in getting the car first,"" she jokes. ""We kind of jumped a bit into it but I think we just have to face it now, really.""

More Technology of Business

For anyone else wondering where they might charge up a new EV, there are an increasing options, says Ben Lane, co-founder at Zap-Map.com.

""At current rates, we're essentially doubling the number of charge points in the UK over a two year period,"" he says. Around 10,000 individual charging connectors were installed in the last 12 months in the UK. However, Dr Lane adds that there are places where gaps in the network are apparent.

""Wales is the country in the United Kingdom that probably needs to do the biggest catch-up,"" he says. And while England has by far the most chargers, there are places where coverage is ""fragmented"".

Certainly, some EV users have not faced the same challenges as the Snowdens in North Yorkshire.

Richard Jackson and his wife bought their first EV, a BMW i3, as an experiment back in 2016.

""We ended up using the BMW for everything,"" he says. ""It very quickly became our main family car.""

Image copyright Virtronix Image caption The Jacksons and their electric cars

Mr Jackson, who used to work in the petrol sector, commutes into London from his home near Hatfield and says that one of his main motivations for buying an electric car was to play a part in reducing ambient pollution in the capital.

""I really could tell, 'Wow, the air is not as good as it is out in the sticks'. I wanted to see… could I make a difference?"" he explains.

He's since bought a second electric car, an MG ZS EV, and hasn't looked back. Planning when and where to charge on journeys is important, Mr Jackson says, but he's taken his car to France on family holidays without problems. Since he began driving an electric vehicle, he has come close to running out of electricity on only one occasion, he says.

However, he does add that while he saves money on petrol, charging the car when out and about does incur other costs: ""My goodness me, you buy a lot of coffees when you go into charge points.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption BP owns the Chargemaster network of charging stations

Most of the charging bays being installed at the moment are being paid for by private businesses - including electricity companies, car makers and firms, like BP for instance, that also run petrol stations. Chargers might be located at service stations or hotels, leisure centres and shopping complexes, for example.

In some cases, these facilities are free to use but most charge a fee or a monthly subscription. There are also important differences to watch out for - charging times will vary widely depending on whether you plug in to a slow, fast or rapid charger.

More than £1.5bn will need to be spent on public charging infrastructure by 2030, according to accountancy firm Deloitte. There are huge costs in terms of supplying cabling and substations as well as the charging points themselves, say Deloitte's Jamie Hamilton and Michael Woodward.

Dr Lane at Zap-Map.com estimates that the UK's chargers will need to be used on average around five times as often as they are today before the system is financially sustainable. Investing in the network now, though, is essential.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many electric cars, including Audi's e-tron promise more than 200 miles between charges

As Mr Hamilton says, ""Lack of charging infrastructure is the number one barrier to people in terms of buying EVs at the moment."" That's become the top concern, having overtaken price and range, according to Deloitte's market research. Some new cars on sale today, including the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Audi e-tron, have more than 200 miles in range.

Even if the number of charging points around the UK does boom, some question whether the electricity grid will be able to cope with thousands of new vehicles thirsty for power.

A National Grid spokeswoman told the BBC that the anticipated increase of in electricity demand of 10% that is expected from EVs is ""entirely manageable"" because peak demand has fallen by 16% in the UK since 2002, due to efficiency gains. However, she adds that the system will still need to ensure everyone isn't plugging in their electric car at once.

This means connecting up charging points to a computer system that determines when they can be used. Currently, private individuals' car-charging habits are difficult to monitor and control.

The government has plans to bring in a new law that would ensure every new home built in the UK has an EV charging point. Some housing developments are already ploughing ahead with this idea.

Pedro Pacheco at market analysts Gartner praises this approach and says that, ultimately, drivers will have to be able to easily charge their cars at home or at work - with minimal change to their daily routines.

""In the end, this is absolutely essential for the acceptance of EVs,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51678830,BBC,Tech,TRUE
,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Face-to-face lectures are being suspended at many universities

Salford, Bristol, Edinburgh, Nottingham and Southampton universities are among the latest to rearrange teaching and exams to limit the spread of Covid-19.

Measures include ending term early, online teaching and cancelling exams.

The moves came as six Oxford students were diagnosed with the virus, while St Andrew's and Bristol universities have each reported a case.

""I recognise many of you are understandably anxious,"" Nottingham's vice-chancellor told students.

Prof Shearer West said in a letter, which she asked students to share with friends and family: ""I am writing to let you know what measures we are taking immediately to reassure you, protect your health and ensure that your learning can continue.""

Nottingham will put all teaching online from 23 March and is cancelling all trips overseas and residential trips within the UK.

However, the letter stresses the university - including its libraries - will remain open.

Salford University has announced all teaching - except for final-year students - will be suspended from Monday, but the campus and student accommodation will remain open.

""This will give us time and space to plan for what may be necessary,"" said a spokesperson.

Edinburgh is also transferring teaching online. Exams are cancelled for first- and second-year students, with those in their third year and beyond taking them online.

Again, the university stressed it was still open, with libraries, counselling, research and study spaces operating as usual.

""Students should be assured that they will achieve their qualifications on time and an Edinburgh degree will still hold the same value,"" said a spokesperson.

The University of West of Scotland has asked students not to attend its campuses from Monday, although it, too, says it will remain open.

It intends to move to remote learning ""to reduce the number of individuals on campus at any one time"".

Early holidays

Meanwhile, the University of Southampton has decided to bring its spring holiday forward by a week so that term now ends on 13 March.

""We will keep any impact to the absolute minimum and ensure all students can successfully complete their term's learning,"" it said in a statement.

Summer term is scheduled to start as normal next month.

Image caption Even if teaching and exams are off, libraries will remain open, say universities

In a similar move, the University of Bristol has announced it will end face-to-face teaching earlier this term, on 18 March. Online teaching will begin after the holidays and all overseas fieldtrips are cancelled.

Bristol vice-chancellor Hugh Brady, said he believed the measures were ""balanced and proportionate"".

""This is indeed a very worrying time for us all - professionally and personally - but I am confident that we can harness our collective ingenuity, resolve and passion for our institution to navigate the choppy waters ahead,"" he said.

'Business as usual'

Across the city, University of West of England took a different approach, tweeting: ""It is currently business as usual here but please rest assured we're monitoring the situation very closely and are able to act quickly if it changes to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our students, staff and visitors.""

A number of universities had previously announced moves to online teaching, including Durham, Manchester Metropolitan, the London School of Economics and Loughborough, where one student has tested positive for the virus.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51880355,BBC,Education,TRUE
,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption There are real worries over the impact the virus will have on learning

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said keeping schools open in England is the ""best course of action"", despite fears about the coronavirus.

It comes as blanket school closures are being announced in European nations such as Spain, France and Ireland.

He told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that sending all pupils home would put a big strain on key workers who would also have to stay at home.

School leaders agreed keeping schools open was the right decision.

Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which is meeting for its annual conference, said head teachers would authorise absence if parents took the decision to keep their children off lessons.

'Exams worry'

He anticipated absences would be small in scale and similar to ""snow days"".

The government has said individual schools may be advised to shut by Public Health England if necessary.

Mr Barton said there was pressure from parents for more information and guidance about what might happen to national exams.

The exam season starts in early May, when the virus outbreak is expected to reach its peak, but exam regulators are urging schools to prepare for public exams as normal.

GCSE exams start in the second week of May and run until mid-June.

Mr Barton said many head teachers were facing questions about the exam season, and there was an urgent need for reassurance.

""Parents and pupils are worried about being the victim of something out of their control and are asking, 'Will I get into college or university?'""

Mr Williamson said: ""We're doing everything we can to make sure it's fair for students, we're having regular discussions with Ofqual.""

The government warned on Thursday that within weeks, whole households would be asked to self-isolate if one person showed symptoms consistent with coronavirus.

It is not clear exactly what this would mean for a teenager unable to sit their exams, but there are mechanisms for allocating marks in exceptional circumstances, which have been used before.

The Welsh government has been advised that school closures are not an appropriate move at the moment, though the situation remains under review.

The Scottish government has also said school closures would not be an effective measure at this stage.

The Republic of Ireland's decision to close schools, colleges and public childcare facilities until 29 March is likely to affect businesses in Northern Ireland's border region that employ staff from the Irish Republic.

In the meantime, many schools will continue to assess how technology could be used to continue pupils' learning in the event of isolated closures.

Sharon Bruton, chief executive of the Keys Federation Academy Trust in Wigan, whose schools use an artificial-intelligence learning platform, said teachers could set assignments via email and social media accounts.

""Schools are adaptable and flexible places - I'm certain school leaders and curriculum leaders will be thinking about how teaching can continue for their students should this be an eventuality,"" she said.

""Educators are remarkably resilient and adaptable and I think part of our job is to meet the needs of our children and make sure they can thrive in challenging circumstances - and this [coronavirus outbreak] won't be any different.""

So the possibility of blanket school closures has been kicked down the road, but that doesn't remove the uncertainty entirely.

No head teacher can rule out the possibility their school could be affected at some point. More pressing is the likelihood that the peak in cases could coincide with exams due to begin in mid-May.

This might mean more households isolating, more teachers off work.

One option could be to move some exams to later in June, when fewer are traditionally scheduled to take place.

This would prolong the agony for teenagers, and their families, but could increase the chances of most being able to sit the exams that are the passport to the next stage of their life.

In the meantime, despite expert advice, some parents continue to call for school closures.

The exams watchdogs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all urging teachers and students to prepare for the exams season as normal.

In Scotland, where exams start earlier than the rest of the UK, the Scottish Qualifications Authority said there was no change to the 2020 national-qualifications timetable.

""Current deadlines for coursework, and other assessments, remain in place,"" it added.

England's exams watchdog, Ofqual, said: ""We continue to work closely with exam boards, other regulators and the Department for Education and we have met to plan for a range of scenarios, as the public would expect.

""Our overriding priorities are fairness to students this summer and keeping disruption to a minimum.""

Qualifications Wales said: ""We will provide guidance on our website to reflect any specific arrangements that schools and colleges should put in place if required.""

Northern Ireland's Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) said there were ""a broad range of contingencies to ensure the smooth operation of examinations"", which would be updated if necessary.

He said that Northern Ireland and the UK would be briefed on developments.

Some 27 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Ireland on Thursday, according to the Department of Health.

There are now 70 total confirmed cases in the country.

The first death linked to coronavirus in Ireland - involving an elderly woman with underlying health conditions - was announced on Wednesday.

Meanwhile two more people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 10.

There are now 596 confirmed cases in the UK.

On Thursday another two more cases were diagnosed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total to 20.

Making the announcement, Mr Varadkar added that indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 500 should be cancelled. He said people should work remotely if possible. Airports and ports will remain open.

Northern Ireland's schools and colleges will not close at this stage. First Minister Arlene Foster said NI would follow scientific advice.

Ireland's chief medical officer Tony Holohan said ""he recognises the differences"" on the island of Ireland in the way governments are dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak.

Twenty-five post-primary schools are to get extra places for new pupils in 2020.

The Department of Education (DE) has created 443 additional places to cope with an expected increase in demand in some areas.

Twenty schools have also been given 361 extra places in expectation of increased pupil numbers in 2021.

The department had previously warned of pressures on post-primary places in 2020 and 2021.

As a result they had asked principals to apply for temporary increases in their pupil intake for those years.

In 2019, 226 pupils had not got a post-primary place when the initial transfer process concluded in June and there was concern that number could rise this year.

The number of pupils due to transfer in 2020 is 24,017, compared to 21,732 in 2017 - a rise of more than 10%.

Those figures do not include pupils with statements of special educational needs, who are placed through a different process.

'Focus on welfare of children'

The department has now decided that a number of post-primaries in Belfast, north Down, Strangford, Newry and Armagh, Fermanagh and south Tyrone, south Antrim and mid-Ulster will get extra places.

In Belfast Grosvenor Grammar, Ashfield Boys' and Girls' High schools, Strathearn College, Our Lady and St Patrick's Knock, St Malachy's College, Dominican College and Blessed Trinity College will admit between 10 and 30 more pupils in 2020.

In addition, Aquinas Grammar will admit 20 extra pupils in 2021, though none in 2020.

,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Many schools opened up in Zimbabwe after independence in 1980

Parents in Zimbabwe could face up to two years in jail if they fail to send their children to school.

The government has made education compulsory up to the age of 16 to stem rising school dropout figures blamed on the poor state of the economy.

It is estimated that in some parts of the country 20% of children do not go to school.

The new law also makes it is an offence to expel children for non-payment of school fees or for becoming pregnant.

Last year at least 60% of the children in primary school were sent home for failing to pay fees, according to the state's Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVac).

Zimbabwe's first leader Robert Mugabe, a former teacher who died last year, was praised for the education policies he adopted after independence in 1980.

The school system he established gave black Zimbabwean greater access to education as hundreds of state schools were opened, leading to Zimbabweans enjoying among the highest literacy rates in Africa.

However, free education ended in the 1990s and in the following decade the education system began to crumble.

What has changed?

The education law has been amended to make sure children in Zimbabwe go to school for a total of 12 years, five years more than was previously prescribed.

Parents are now also in the firing line if their offspring fail to go to school.

They face up two years in jail - or a $260 (£200) fine if they can afford to pay it - if their children are found not to be attending classes.

The BBC's Shingai Nyoka in the capital, Harare, says it seems to be a bold attempt to force parents to prioritise education during an economic crisis.

But some believe the government is shirking its responsibilities amidst broken promises to provide free basic education and a chronic shortage of state schools.

The high drop-out rate has also been blamed on pregnancy, early marriages, the long distances to schools and a lack of interest, our reporter adds.

Why are children dropping out?

By Shingai Nyoka, BBC News, Harare

Parents have been spending less on education as they struggle to buy food. Fees at government-run schools must be paid up front and range from between $30 (£23) and $700 a year, depending on where they are based.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Unregistered schools don't insist on school uniforms

Last year, parents spent a third what they did in 2018 on education, says ZimVac.

In a sign of the desperate times, makeshift schools in poor areas of the capital, like Epworth, have been sprouting up in homes and backyards. They are unregistered - and therefore illegal. They can work out cheaper - about $3 a month - though their main draw is their flexibility about when the fees are paid.

Eunice Maronga, who runs one of these schools, says the children bring in money if and when they can. They are also more flexible about uniforms, though a $3-education has its drawbacks: no desks and one textbook - for the teacher.

""The reason why there is an increase in unregistered schools is because of the shortage of government schools - to the tune of about 2,000 schools,"" says Liberty Matsive, from the non-governmental organisation Education Coalition of Zimbabwe.

Elizabeth Chibanda, whose children are at home after her food-vending business collapsed, says she has sent her eight-year-old daughter back to her home village.

""She is doing nothing in the village, but I was ashamed to have a grade-three student sitting around, when it's so obvious to everyone she should be in school.""

Ms Chibanda said she was unable to get her son, who is six, into grade one at the start of the school year in January: ""With my son, I can pretend he is not of school-going age yet.""

Why is the economy is such bad shape?

Mr Mugabe was ousted from power in November 2017 with the hope that his army-backed successor and former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, would help revive the economy.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption About 89% of adult Zimbabweans can read and write - among the highest literacy rates in Africa, according to 2014 World Bank data

But things have gone from bad to worse - and a decade on from the hyperinflation that devastated the economy, Zimbabwe is again facing rampant inflation, frequent shortages of foreign currency, food, fuel, electricity and medicine.

The country, which was once a major food producer, is also currently in the middle of a drought.

Last week, the US extended sanctions against Zimbabwe's top leaders, citing their actions to ""undermine democratic processes or institutions"", persecuting critics and economic mismanagement.

President Mnangagwa has blamed sanctions for crippling development in the country.

But Washington says their economic impact is limited to the farms and companies owned by about 80 of the targeted individuals, who include the president.

Staff at an infant school are frequently the target of violence from pupils, a report has found.

Ofsted inspectors found pupils at St George's Infant School and Nursery in Colchester ""throw things in lessons"" and some ""fail to follow basic rules"".

Inspectors said the majority of pupils behaved well, but ""not enough is done to stop the unacceptable behaviour of a few"" and rated the school inadequate.

The school said it was ""working hard"" to act upon ""lessons learned"".

The inspection in January, which followed a one in which the school was rated as requiring improvement, found ""standards achieved by pupils currently in the school are still poor"".

""This is because the curriculum is not planned or taught well enough,"" inspectors said, adding attendance at the school ""has not been high enough"".

Inspectors said: ""Behaviour management has improved, but is not having sufficient impact. There are frequent assaults on staff by pupils.

""While the majority of pupils behave well, not enough is done to stop the unacceptable behaviour of a few.

""Staff feel protected from bullying and harassment, but they do not feel protected from violence from pupils.""

Parents of premature babies will be able to claim an extra £160 a week under measures set to be announced by the chancellor in next week's Budget.

It follows a campaign by Croydon mum Catriona Ogilvy which has been backed by over 350,000 people.

Current law states maternity and paternity leave begins the day after birth even if a baby is born premature.

Treasury minister Kemi Badenoch said the government would pay the extra leave, rather than businesses.

Mrs Ogilvy - who spent time in a neonatal ward after her son, Samuel, was born 10 weeks early - has petitioned to extend parental leave following premature birth since 2015.

Her campaigning has seen the Mayor of London, Sony Music and a number of London councils adopt policies to give extra leave to staff who have babies born early.

It is expected that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will outline plans for Neonatal Pay and Leave on Wednesday to allow new mothers and fathers to claim statutory paid leave for every week their child is in neonatal care, up to a maximum of 12 weeks.

Mrs Badenoch, the Minister for Equalities, told the Sunday Times the move would be ""historic"".

""This will be in addition to the usual maternity and paternity leave, and finally give parents the time, the resources and the space to handle these difficult circumstances,"" she said.

Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd says she had an invitation to speak at an Oxford University society pulled half an hour before she was due to appear.

Ms Rudd, who stepped down as an MP in December, was due to speak to the UN Women Oxford UK society on Thursday.

Following a vote of its committee, understood to relate to her role in the Windrush scandal, the invitation was pulled.

Ms Rudd said some students' treatment of her was ""badly judged and rude"".

She had been due to speak about UN Women's Draw A Line campaign and her experiences of being an MP and minister for women and equalities.

Ms Rudd urged students to ""stop hiding and start engaging"".

She resigned as home secretary in April 2018 after people living legally in the UK were detained and deported and she inadvertently misled a Commons committee about the number of people who had been involved.

The UN Women Oxford UK society wrote on Facebook on Thursday: ""Following a majority vote in committee, tonight's event with speaker Amber Rudd has been cancelled.

It added it was ""deeply sorry for all and any hurt caused"" over the event.

Earlier in the week, it said the conversation with Ms Rudd would have been ""an honest and frank conversation"" about how her policies had impacted women of all races.

It had urged students to attend the event ""to help campaign for a truly frank feminism which is not afraid of taking opportunities to discuss issues with high profile figures"".

""I know that many people will be very worried,"" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, addressing the UK's older people as he announced new measures to tackle coronavirus.

""I think we should all be thinking about our elderly relatives... and everything we can do to protect them over the next few months.""

Caroline, from south-east England, is one of the many concerned about visiting elderly relatives in the midst of the UK's coronavirus outbreak.

Until now Caroline, who has asked us not to use her surname, has been visiting her sister, who is living with dementia and in a care home. But now she says she is ""not sure"" whether she should continue her visits in case she spreads the virus inadvertently.

""It just gets into my head - is it better not to go because you don't know if you are bringing germs?"" she says.

Older people are more likely to become severely ill if they catch it, the NHS says. Generally, it says anyone over the age of 65 is considered an ""older person"" but there is no strict definition as people age at different rates.

But what measures are being taken and what advice is there for looking after older and elderly people?

What are care homes doing?

Care homes have responded in a mix of ways so far, with some residential and nursing homes deciding to restrict visitors.

Barchester Care Homes, which has more than 11,000 residents spread across more than 200 homes in the UK, is asking family members and friends to ""minimise"" their visits.

In a letter to residents and visitors, it says it has not taken the decision lightly and appreciates it may cause some discomfort. But ""this is a necessary step to take"", it adds

Relatives must speak to the manager at the care home before making any visit, the letter added.

Elsewhere, St Augustine's Court Care Home in Nottingham is also requesting people to avoid visiting.

""Where visiting is essential, we would ask for only one visitor per resident, please,"" the home's administrator said, adding that hand gel should be used and phone calls are still welcome.

Ryan Moring, manager of The Haven care home in Colchester, said the home has not yet shut its doors to visitors but it is taking ""precautionary measures"".

""At the moment, every visitor who enters the building we insist they wash and sanitise their hands. If they don't wish to do that we don't let them come in.

""We have restricted visitors from outside entertainment, singers, exercise classes because those people visit numerous care homes.""

He stressed contact is ""very important"" for dementia patients in the home, but they have contingency plans in place for if the virus spreads, with facilities to use Skype.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A drop-off point to receive samples of the coronavirus for testing at Leeds General Infirmary

Caroline, who is debating whether to continue visiting her sister, says there has been a ""deafening silence"" about the virus at her care home.

She says there is a ""whole community of people who are vulnerable"", adding that her sister ""tends to want to hold my hand; I do wash my hands"".

What about visiting older people in their own homes?

As yet, the government has not issued any advice suggesting older people should be kept away from the wider population.

But some people have taken the decision not to see older relatives.

Columnist Lucy Mangan told the BBC's Emma Barnett Show she felt ""quite upset"" after reaching an agreement with her parents she will not be visiting them for the forseeable future.

""I've never lived through a pandemic before. It's all new and it feels really weird and horrible.

""We're all reaching that critical point now where we have to take stock and go, if I go to my parents I could be carrying something that could kill them. That's the reality of it.""

Image copyright EPA Image caption Some people are wearing face masks although the government does not advise it

Mark Storey, the head of Sheffield Churches Council for Community Care, says they are continuing to run their services - which involves visiting older people at home to prevent loneliness and also helping with hospital discharges.

""We are open as usual,"" he says. ""We do have a Covid-19 plan in place in case we are impacted.""

""Whilst we are not panicking and not shouting from the rooftops, we have got to take a responsibility,"" he says. ""Every one of us has got a duty of care.

""Our message is we are continuing to be open. Everything is under review all the time.""

He says contact for older people is ""vital"", and although face-to-face visits are best, they could be replaced by phone calls if there is a risk of spreading the virus.

Anna Lawless, 70, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Surrey, says she is ""uncertain"" whether it would be a good idea to stop visiting older people, saying it would ""cause a great deal of stress"".

She told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the attitude among residents in her accommodation block was ""if I get it, I get it, there's nothing I can do about it"".

What else can we do?

Simon Hewett-Avison, from charity Independent Age, says families do need to make sure elderly people have the supplies they need such as food and medication - but urged a ""balanced approach"" rather than panicked stockpiling.

He warned the virus could increase the risk of isolating people further.

""We have seen elderly people are quite concerned about this. I was talking to a lady last week in Teesside. She was constantly looking at the news and was really concerned.""

He added: ""We are keen to encourage people to see this as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends that we have fallen out of contact with and check in with them.""

He added that four million over-65s live alone in the UK, and much of the advice often relies on older people having a support network - but that community groups can provide support.

He said his charity could focus more on telephone contact if the outbreak worsens.

Mental health charity Mind also has tips for those who may be alone or worried about the virus, including putting extra photos up of people you care about, and limiting how long you read the news.

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, also recommends that people with elderly friends and relatives make sure they check on them regularly. ""If you have any concerns about their health or need more information about coronavirus call NHS 111 or visit the NHS website,"" she said.

Age UK's online advice adds: ""The government hasn't said we should stop going out or meeting up with other people.

""Most people can keep doing what they normally do as long as they don't have symptoms and maintain good hygiene practices like washing their hands regularly. You only need to stay at home and avoid contact with other people (called 'self-isolating') if you've been advised to by NHS 111 or a medical professional.""

,"Image copyright Cransley School Image caption Cransley School in Cheshire has been closed over coronavirus symptom fears

Some UK schools have closed over fears pupils and staff members may have been exposed to coronavirus after travelling abroad during the half-term break.

Others have sent pupils and staff home, as the illness continues to spread across Europe.

However, Public Health England (PHE) says it is not advising schools to shut to stem the spread of the virus.

Why are some schools closing their doors?

One academy chain chief executive told BBC News the decision to close one of his schools - Trinity Catholic College, in Middlesbrough - was primarily about the school's duty of care towards pupils and staff.

Hugh Hegarty, head of the Nicholas Postgate Catholic Academy Trust, which oversees the closed school, said he had made the decision after 36 pupils and eight staff members returned from a skiing trip to Italy over half-term.

""It's important people acknowledge that schools and other organisations have a duty of care to staff and have a duty of care to their children - and that is my paramount concern,"" said Mr Hegarty.

""The challenge for us was... the children had returned to school on Monday, so there had been the potential that the total school population had been exposed - even though it was minimal - to the potential risk and potential threat.

""The decision was made to advise those parents who had children on the ski trip to self-isolate and the other students to remain at home until we commence a deep clean.""

In Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the ContinU Plus Academy closed for the day on Wednesday after a staff member had been in ""close contact"" with a family member self-isolating following a trip to northern Italy.

William Martin Church of England Junior, Infant and Nursery School in Harlow, Essex, also closed on Wednesday after a staff member had returned from Italy.

Head teacher Gina Bailey said: ""The school is closed for one day and it is purely as a precaution. The staff member is not displaying any symptoms of the virus.""

But other schools have decided not to close following ski trips to northern Italy.

At St Aldhelm's Academy, in Dorset, head teacher Jon Webb wrote to parents: ""As it currently stands, we are not aware of anyone returning from the ski trip who are displaying symptoms that would cause us to have any concerns.""

What is the official advice to schools?

PHE's medical director Prof Paul Cosford acknowledged schools had to take ""difficult decisions given the complexity of the issues that they're facing"".

""Of course, schools have difficult decisions to take - a whole range of issues to take into account and we are able to talk to them about their specific circumstances and help them make the right decisions for them,"" he said.

""But what I would say is that our general advice is not to close schools.""

Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""no blanket closure"" for schools and the ""goal was to keep schools open"".

""If anyone has been in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or an educational setting, no special measures are required while test results are awaited,"" Mr Hancock told MPs.

""There is no need to close the school or send other students or staff home.

""Once the results arrive, those who test negative will be advised individually about returning to education.

""In most cases, closure of the childcare or education setting will be unnecessary but this will be a local decision based on various factors including professional advice.""

Head teachers in England should contact their regional schools commissioners should they need advice, he added.

Dr Bharat Pankhania, from University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""If you have returned from the area of northern Italy that is currently in lockdown since 19 February, you need to self-isolate, as per the advice from Public health England and the UK government.

""However, there's no need for a school to close. There are consequences to closing schools.

""It's disproportionate and it gives the wrong impression. It makes people extremely concerned, when there's no need to be.""

Official government guidance for educational settings says if a pupil or member of staff is confirmed as having coronavirus, anyone who has been ""in close face-to-face or touching contact, including those undertaking small group work (within 2m [6ft] of the case for more than 15 minutes)"" should self-isolate at home, or within their boarding school dormitory room, for 14 days"".

Does parental pressure affect head teachers' decisions?

Some parents have expressed concern via social media about their child coming into contact with the coronavirus, particularly if fellow pupils have been away in northern Italy.

But while some parents want to see schools closed, others do not want their child's education to be disrupted.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Schools listen carefully to the views of parents and they will obviously have regard to this feedback in making decisions over how to respond to any situation regarding coronavirus.

""However, it is often the case that different parents will have different views over an unfolding event, so school leaders have to take this range of opinion on board, together with the views of other stakeholders, and make a judgement on what response serves the best interests of all pupils and staff.""

Could there be an impact on the exam season?

With the exam season coming up next term, some teachers, parents and young people may be worried about disruption to important exams.

But the exams watchdog Ofqual said it was monitoring the situation closely and students should not be concerned.

""We routinely consider whether there are particular risks to the smooth running of exams and we are working closely with the exam boards and with the Department for Education,"" a spokesman said.

""We will update our existing guidance to reflect any specific arrangements schools and colleges should put in place if required.

""In the meantime, students should continue to prepare for the summer exams as usual and schools and colleges should ensure their contingency plans are up to date.""

Mr Barton added: ""We would urge students who are studying for their exams not to worry about what may or may not happen with regards to coronavirus and to concentrate on preparing for these important qualifications.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,BBC,Education,TRUE
,"Image copyright PA Media Image caption There have been worries about the impact of coronavirus as the exam season approaches

The exam watchdog, responding to concerns about coronavirus, is telling schools in England to keep preparing as usual for the summer exam season.

Ofqual says it is working with exam boards and the government to make contingency plans if there is a ""widespread outbreak"".

But until that becomes necessary, the watchdog is telling schools to assume exams will continue as scheduled.

Most GCSEs and A-level exams are planned to run from early May.

On Monday, Ofqual issued advice that ""students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer exams and assessments as usual"".

But it said there would be guidance to ""manage any particular risks"" to the exam season if coronavirus became widespread.

The watchdog said it would send any updated information when necessary - and also shared existing contingency plans for exams being disrupted.

This covers emergencies that might happen during the exam season - which could see pupils having to take an exam in a different location from their own school or rearranging the time of an exam.

But these responses are usually for problems facing a small number of individual schools, pupils or staff.

So far, more than 20 schools have been closed at some point in response to concerns over coronavirus - and others have sent home pupils, such as those who had returned from a half-term trip to an area with higher levels of the virus.

'Best advice'

In the most recent cases involving the virus, there were reports of a member of staff infected in a primary school in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and in an infant school in Woodley, Berkshire.

But some of these schools will have returned to normal - and the great majority of the school system, with more than 24,000 schools in England, does not seem to have been significantly affected by the virus.

With the exam revision season already bringing its own stresses, ASCL head teachers' union Geoff Barton said: ""Schools and colleges will be approaching the possibility of the coronavirus situation disrupting exams in a calm and measured manner, hoping for the best and preparing for the worst.

""We would urge students to focus on studying for their exams and not to worry about what may or may not happen.""

National Association of Head Teachers leader Paul Whiteman said: ""Our best advice to school leaders is to encourage them to stay on top of the continually updated advice from the government, share it with pupils and their families and act accordingly.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51707144,BBC,Education,TRUE
"['Sean Coughlan', 'Bbc News']","Image caption The new passport (left) is a return to the ""iconic blue"" of the old one, the Home Office says

Is the new UK passport blue? Or is the colour really closer to black?

The Home Office has issued pictures of the post-Brexit passport, describing it as a return to the ""iconic blue"" used for UK passports before 1988.

Experts in the science of colour - and instant experts on social media - are unconvinced, saying they look more like black.

But a Home Office spokesman says the colours of both the old and new passports are shades of blue.

""I'd say it's black,"" says Stephen Westland, professor of colour science and technology at the University of Leeds.

""If most people looked at this, they'd say it's black.""

But he says describing colours in terms of names can be imprecise - and individuals will have their own different perspectives.

If enough blue is added to black, he says there will be a transition point when people will begin to see the colour as blue.

""But that point varies for different people,"" he says.

That means that some might see a colour as an extremely dark shade of blue, while others would see it as black.

Perhaps allowing the Home Office not to be entirely painted into a corner, he suggests the colour might be ""bluish black"".

But in essence, Prof Westland says, ""this is closer to black"".

However he says the perception of colour can be influenced by its context - and by calling it a ""blue passport"" people might be more likely to see it as leaning towards blue.

Replacing the burgundy-coloured European Union document, the new UK passport has been described as a return to the ""traditional colour"".

Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the return to this ""iconic blue"" was ""entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one"".

The Home Office would not specify the shade of this blue, although a spokesman said it was close to, if not exactly, a blue numbered as 5395C in the Pantone classification.

But Craig Burston, senior lecturer in graphic design at the London College of Communication, which incorporates what was the London College of Printing, says there is nothing to suggest the ""dominant colour"" of the new passport is blue.

He suggests the colour is charcoal, maybe with a hint of blue.

But if it is blue, ""it must be the most apologetic shade of blue they could find"" because ""it's as black as blue gets"".

""You'd be hard pushed to get something that is darker that would be defined as blue,"" Mr Burston says.

""It's as near as damn it black.""

Skip Twitter post by @EveOrEvie Can we stop fighting about whether the passports are blue or black, the word Navy exists for a reason. — Evie (@EveOrEvie) March 2, 2020 Report

There could be differences depending on printing processes, lighting and the ""sheen"", he says.

But the question of the colour seems to have been mixed up with the politics of ""blue passports"".

And the social-media debate seems to be about Brexit as much as colour charts.

A spokesman for paint company Farrow and Ball says ""pure"" black would have no other colours added.

But in practice, blacks used in the ""everyday world would have a slight colour to them"", such as blue, grey or red.

This could make the passport a very dark blue although ""some people may perceive it as black"".

It is ""probably black blue,"" said the paint firm's spokesman.

There have been other internet debates over identifying colours - such as whether a dress was blue or white and gold.

Prof Westland says this reflects how people tend to see colours in quite definite ways, coming down on one side or the other, even though we know there are all kinds of shades and ambiguities.

"['Hannah Richardson', 'Education', 'Social Affairs Reporter']","Image caption Ms Staples needed accommodation after her marriage broke down

The battle against the discriminatory practice of landlords not renting to benefit claimants has intensified after legal victories by two single mothers.

Amanda Staples and Emma Loffler both won out-of-court settlements against ""No DSS"" letting agents, on the grounds of indirect discrimination.

In a 2018 case, another single mother, Rosie Keogh, backed by charity Shelter, successfully argued blanket bans on claimants indirectly discriminated against women and disabled people who are more likely to be on benefits.

Ms Keogh's case was cited in letters of complaint Ms Staples and Ms Loffler wrote to different letting agents who had refused to show them properties.

Shelter took on their legal cases when the agents refused to budge.

Personal circumstances

Ms Staples, 36, who has three primary-aged children, needed accommodation after her marriage broke down.

""I kept ringing around estate agents and when I said I would be a housing benefit [claimant] it was a blanket 'No,'"" she said.

When a property came up in the Cambridgeshire village she was based in, she was initially excited but then hit a wall.

""I had noticed 'No DSS' adverts before but I thought I would be able to find somewhere locally so my children could still go to the same school and so I could keep my job there,"" she said.

""It was really uncomfortable to keep having to explain my personal circumstances to strangers.

""The whole thing was so difficult - I was working part time, I've always paid my rent, I had a child-maintenance order, and I ended up on benefits because of the divorce and because I had three children.""

Ms Staples offered to pay six months' rent up-front, and then 12 months' after an offer of a loan from her father, but the letting agent kept saying the landlord's insurance did not cover tenants on benefits.

Image caption After Shelter supported her legal action, Ms Staples's boys were able to stay at the same school

She said: ""After a while, talking to this one particular estate agent, I just said; 'Nothing I say is going to make any difference is it?' And he said, 'No.'""

With Shelter backing her legal action, the letting agent ultimately agreed to write a public letter of apology and to pay £3,000 compensation and the £10,000 legal costs.

The agent in Ms Loffler's case, meanwhile, also issued a public letter of apology and paid £3,500 compensation and £2,500 towards legal costs.

'Grossly unfair'

Shelter chief executive Polly Neate said: ""The message is clear - letting agents and landlords must not treat potential tenants as second-class citizens simply because they rely on benefits.

""If they continue to blindly discriminate against those receiving housing benefit, they risk legal action and a hefty fine.

""Not only is 'No DSS' discrimination outdated and grossly unfair, it is unlawful under the Equality Act because it overwhelming impacts women and disabled people, who are more likely to need support paying their rent.""

Image caption Ms Loffler was paid £3,500 compensation

The housing charity analysed 7,100 adverts on the biggest letting agent websites, including OpenRent, Rightmove, Countrywide and Zoopla, and found more than one in 10 contained phrases such as ""No DSS"" or similar.

Agents and landlords could face fines of about £5,000 per advert based on the three payouts made in cases so far, it said.

But a poll of 1,009 private landlords for the charity by YouGov in December 2019 and January 2020 revealed:

86% thought ""No DSS"" was lawful or were not sure

29% said they did not currently let to people receiving housing benefit and were advised not to by their letting agent

The Residential Landlords Association urged the government to:

stop lenders preventing a landlord from renting to benefit claimants as a condition of their buy-to-let mortgage,

align housing benefit with local rent levels

restore the right of tenants to choose to have the housing element of their benefit paid directly to their landlord

How to fight 'No DSS' landlords and letting agents

Keep a written note of phone and face-to-face conversations if you start to hear a ""No DSS"" message. Hold on to any emails.

Ensure there is no other reason the agent will not let you rent

Provide agents with evidence of previous reliability and ability to pay with housing benefit

"['Sean Coughlan', 'Bbc News Family', 'Education Correspondent']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption University leaders say the value of higher education should be measured in more than just earning power

Higher pay still makes it financially beneficial to go to university for most students in England, says research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

But 20% are worse off after paying for courses, says the study commissioned by the Department for Education.

Over their working lives, male graduates on average gain by £130,000 and female graduates by £100,000.

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says students and taxpayers needed to get value from their ""investment"".

The government has promised to tackle ""low quality"" courses.

But university leaders say there can be other forms of social and personal ""value"" from higher education, as well as measurements of graduate earnings.

The study on projected earnings, based on tax data, shows wide variations in the financial winners and losers between different subjects.

For women, the financial gains of studying creative arts and languages are ""close to zero""

Medicine will bring an extra £340,000 for women, economics £270,000 and £260,000 for law

Men studying creative arts subjects are projected to lose £100,000, compared to their counterparts who did not go to university

For men in the top-earning subject areas of medicine and economics, the likely gain is £500,000

For both men and women there are low financial returns for graduates in English and biology

Individual universities are not identified, but more selective universities tend to lead to bigger earnings

These gains and losses are counted after the cost of going to university has been deducted.

This includes £9,250 per year in tuition fees, loans for living costs, interest charged on loans and lost potential earnings from studying rather than being in jobs.

The average student graduates with about £50,000 in debt.

More women go to university than men - and a higher proportion of women, 85%, compared with 75% of men, will get a positive financial return.

But female graduates have lower lifetime earnings, which the analysis says is likely to reflect women taking time off or reducing hours when they have children.

The gender gap in earnings opens when graduates are in their 30s - although the data does not distinguish between part-time and full-time work so part-time could look like lower pay.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The study will raise questions about which subjects should be funded

But for 70,000 students each year the costs of going to university - such as fees, loans and lost earnings while they studied - will be greater than any extra money they make in earnings, so they make less than their counterparts who went to work straight after A-levels.

Ben Waltmann, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the public finances gained on average from higher education, ""because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax"".

That still meant that government finances had to subsidise almost half of individual graduates - with the biggest losses concentrated in subjects such as creative arts.

There have been suggestions that funding could be restricted for degrees offering poor value to students.

And these findings are published as the government prepares its response to Philip Augar's review of student finance.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Graduates with economics degrees are among the highest earners

This recommended that tuition fees should be cut to £7,500 and that students needed better value for money.

The higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, is also carrying out a review into how funding grants should be prioritised between different subjects.

But the UCU lecturers' union has warned against making simplistic links between the quality of a course and future salaries.

""Earnings potential is also heavily impacted by factors such as an individual's background, their parents' jobs, their gender, where they are from and where they live after graduating,"" says union leader Jo Grady.

And she said decisions about the value of courses needed to reflect ""the wider benefits that education brings to individuals and to society"".

Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said it was crucial that university applicants had ""clear and factual information"" and ""data on earnings potential is an important part of that picture"".

Others argued that apprenticeships were better value.

""This analysis is fresh evidence of how the current university model is broken,"" said Euan Blair, co-founder of apprenticeship provider WhiteHat.

""Young people are being pressured to go to university without any consideration given to whether the experience will be positive or if they'll be equipped to pursue the career they want,"" he said.

But even when earnings might be relatively low, graduates might be working in sectors making ""vital contributions to the wider economy and society"", said Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK.

He said it was important to recognise that the ""benefits of a degree stretch far beyond salary outcomes"".

Universities Minister Michelle Donelan also highlighted the ""unquantifiable experiences and friendships"" of university.

But she said the reputation of the university sector depended on ""quality"" and that had to be safeguarded so that ""students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment"".",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51676530,BBC,Education,TRUE

""It's educated people who are causing the most damage to the planet,"" says sixth-former Joe Brindle.

Joe, 17, says schools need to put the environment at the heart of education.

Ministers agree ""it is vital that pupils are taught about climate change"" but Joe says schools are failing to prepare them for a climate emergency.

He is a founder member of Teach the Future which next week takes its call for an environmental overhaul of education to Parliament.

""It's people with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge who are becoming fossil-fuel chief executives and they are the ones who are causing the most destruction to our world,"" says Joe.

""And therefore that kind of shows that education is not succeeding and that our education is broken because education should be creating better people not worse.""

On Wednesday, Joe, a pupil at Devizes School, and more than a dozen other under-18s who make up the core of Teach the Future, will take over Parliament's Terrace Pavilion to host a crowdfunded reception for MPs.

The group, run jointly by the UK Student Climate Network, best known for the school climate strikes, and the National Union of Students' climate charity offshoot, SOS-UK, is launching a draft English emergency education bill which embodies their key demands and which Joe believes ""is going to be really big"".

Teach the Future is hoping the draft could at some stage form the basis of a private member's bill but for now, the aim is ""to get MPs on our side"".

The idea is based on the 1958 US National Defense Education Act which aimed to kickstart engineering, maths and science education and give America the edge in the space and arms races.

It paid off - by July 1969, the average age in Apollo mission control was just 28.

""I think it really shows that education can be used to solve a difficult problem, if the focus is down from the government,"" says Joe, who will sit A-levels in history, biology and chemistry this summer.

Image copyright TRW/PhotoQuest/Getty Images Image caption Most mission control staff on Nasa's Apollo programme were in their 20s

But rather than focusing exclusively on science, technology, engineering and maths - the range of the climate emergency education act needs to be far wider, he believes.

""The space race was just one thing but the climate crisis affects every single part of everything and it requires solutions from every single part of society, whether it be arts, whether it be maths, whether it be sciences.""

He wants everyone to understand the impact of their behaviour on the environment and ""try to do things in a way that has as little negative impact as you can"".

And while engineers have an important role, fundamentally, education needs to become more sustainable, he says.

People need to understand how the climate crisis happened, he argues: ""It's a symptom of a general unsustainable system.""

Image copyright Joe Brindle Image caption Joe speaking at the NUS Sustainability Summit in November 2019

Joe believes most people his age ""want to understand more about climate change and what's behind it, the issues of justice... and the politics behind it"".

But he says that while schools are largely sympathetic, they are constrained by limited budgets and the demands of a high-stakes exam system - and often teachers themselves lack detailed knowledge about climate change.

""It's not good enough that sustainability is restricted to a few subjects and most of our teachers and lecturers don't know enough about it,"" say the campaigners.

They also point out that including climate change in the national curriculum will only affect local authority schools - not academies, free schools or the private sector.

The group has invited dozens of MPs to the reception and are ""particularly hoping government ministers and people close to the government will be there"".

Zero-carbon schools

Teach the Future's wish-list also includes having climate science and sustainability included in teacher training and all education buildings to have a net-zero carbon footprint by 2030.

The group was founded in autumn 2019 but already has support from leading education unions and environmental organisations. It is hoping that several dozen MPs will attend the reception.

In a statement, the government said: ""It is vital that pupils are taught about climate change, which is why topics are included across the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools. Teachers have the freedom to expand on these areas if they wish.

""This government is a world leader in tackling climate change and we are the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. The Department for Education provides funding to support schools to become more sustainable institutions.""

A spokesperson said topics related to climate change and sustainability were included in the national curriculum for science and geography, a new environmental science A-level was introduced in 2017 and sustainability will be included in some new T-level technical qualifications, for example, construction students will learn about renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies.

,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt Hancock: ""Getting through this is going to be a national effort""

Every Briton over the age of 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period to protect themselves from coronavirus.

When it happens, they will be asked to stay home for ""a very long time"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

The government is to release social distancing advice for elderly people on Monday - but they will not yet be asked to self-isolate for long periods.

Fourteen more people have died from the virus, bringing deaths in the UK to 35.

Mr Hancock told the BBC that manufacturers were being asked to help produce medical equipment, such as ventilators, to help with an expected surge in demand by the NHS.

He also said hotels could be converted into makeshift hospitals, while the government has begun negotiating with private healthcare providers to obtain thousands of extra beds in private hospitals.

What are the latest figures?

The number of confirmed UK cases of the virus has reached 1,372, with 40,279 people tested, according to the latest Department of Health figures.

Almost all of the new cases were in England, but 34 new cases were announced in Wales, 32 in Scotland and 11 in Northern Ireland.

Most of the 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK have so far been people aged over 60 and with underlying health conditions.

People self-isolating with mild symptoms of the virus are no longer being tested. The government says tests will primarily be given:

To all patients needing hospital treatment for pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or a flu-like illness

Where an outbreak has occurred in a residential or care setting, for example long-term care facilities or prisons

What are the government's plans?

Mr Hancock said the over-70s and people with certain health conditions would soon be asked to self-isolate - but he did not say for how long.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show people without symptoms would still be able to visit older relatives and friends as long as they stayed 2m (6ft) away from them.

The health secretary also said the NHS would stop non-urgent surgery and retrain medics from other specialisms to treat those with the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19.

The Scottish government said it had no plans to isolate the elderly, but would instead ""ask them to reduce social contact"".

Jeane Freeman, Mr Hancock's counterpart in Scotland, said: ""We don't want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them.""

Scottish ministers have also advised against gatherings of 500 people or more. They do not have the power to call off events but have urged organisers to ""act responsibly"" by cancelling such gatherings from Monday.

Who are the latest victims?

Image copyright Nick Matthews Facebook Image caption Mary Matthews paid tribute to her husband, Nick, on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""best friend""

The 14 patients whose deaths were announced on Sunday were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions, NHS England said.

Among them was retired police officer Nick Matthews, 59, of Nailsea, near Bristol, who died at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday.

His wife, Mary, paid tribute on Facebook, saying she had lost her ""soul mate"" and ""best friend"".

She urged people not to visit her and her family until their own test results for the virus came back.

Mr and Mrs Matthews had returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura, in the Canary Islands, on 29 February.

How many ventilators are needed?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available at the moment - but that many times that number would be needed.

Car companies and weapon manufacturers are among the firms the government has asked to help to make ventilators to treat Covid-19 patients.

Ventilators treat severe breathing problems caused by Covid-19 by giving people oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from their lungs.

Digger manufacturer JCB said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if it could help.

JCB chairman Lord Bamford said it was ""unclear"" whether the firm could agree to do so, but that engineers were ""actively looking"" at the request.

Why and when should vulnerable people self-isolate?

Shielding the vulnerable and elderly will be an essential part of the government's strategy when cases are rising rapidly - it was one of the decisions signed off at an emergency Cobra meeting on Thursday.

Half of the overall cases are expected within a period of a few weeks, with 95% in a period of around 10 weeks.

So officials will ask those at most risk of developing severe illness to stay at home.

They believe if they get the timing right and people adhere to it the move could reduce the number of deaths by up to a third.

But it of course carries its own risks - mentally and physically.

They believe the longest they could ask people to do this for is around 12 weeks.

That's why it's essential people don't start too soon. At the moment the vulnerable groups should be protected to a degree by the fact that the small number of people with the virus should be self-isolating.

But officials recognise individuals will make their own decisions about when to start.

What else is going on?

South Africa has barred some foreigners from entering and will close schools

EU states including Germany, Austria and France are among the latest to announce radical action to curb the spread of the virus

The Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Spain after the government there announced emergency restrictions

The government is in talks with rail bosses to put emergency measures in place to deal with falling passenger numbers after the coronavirus outbreak.

Some train operators were already losing money but fewer fares will put even more pressure on their finances.

A senior industry source said fairly drastic measures might be required for train companies to survive.

At an industry meeting last week, passenger numbers were said to have fallen by up to 18% on certain lines.

However, another industry source acknowledged that the fall in passengers could be significantly higher.

They told the BBC that the number of passengers travelling through major UK train stations at peak times had dropped considerably in recent days.

Very up-to-date figures for the whole UK network are not known as many tickets are still not purchased digitally, so it takes some time for the data to filter through.

Under franchise agreements, train companies have a range of contractual obligations, which govern how many trains they run and restrict how much they can charge for tickets.

They are also required to make payments to the government to run services on parts of the rail network.

The number of trains, the price of tickets and the amount companies pay government are all calculated based on assumptions about passenger numbers.

But, with fewer people catching the train - as some companies ask staff to work from home over fears about the spread of the coronavirus - the ability of rail companies to meet some of those obligations is now in doubt.

Emergency talks

The BBC understands that train operators are in talks with government to renegotiate the terms of some of those contracts.

Train companies want the government to give them more wriggle room so they can keep operating services for essential travel for people working in the emergency services, even though broader passenger numbers have fallen.

Options being discussed are likely to include a reduction in the number of train services and flexibility over the payments that train companies make to government.

,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Panic buying has left some supermarkets in the UK with empty shelves

Supermarkets are urging shoppers not to buy more than they need amid concern over coronavirus-linked stockpiling.

In a joint letter, UK retailers have reminded customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items.

""There is enough for everyone if we all work together,"" it adds.

It comes after some shops began rationing the sales of certain products to avoid them selling out completely.

In the letter, the retailers say online and click-and-collect services are at ""full capacity"" and staff and suppliers are ""working day and night to keep the nation fed"".

The retailers say they are working ""closely"" with government and suppliers to make more deliveries to stores so that shelves are well-stocked.

""We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without,"" the letter reads.

That was echoed in an email to customers from Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe, who said: ""There are gaps on shelves because of increased demand, but we have new stock arriving regularly and we're doing our best to keep shelves stocked.""

In a plea to shoppers, he said: ""Please think before you buy and only buy what you and your family need.""

Speaking on behalf of retailers, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said: ""In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.""

The plea follows widespread concern over shoppers emptying supermarket shelves as fears grow over the spread of coronavirus.

Long queues were reported outside some supermarkets on Sunday morning.

Items including toilet paper, hand sanitiser, pasta and tinned foods are among those that have been in short supply.

That has led some supermarkets to limit the sale of some products, while Aldi has restricted customers to buying a maximum of four of each item.

Tesco, shoppers are limited to buying no more than five of certain goods, including anti-bacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables.

Campaigners have warned stockpiling could hit the ""most vulnerable"" hardest.

Analysis

By Katy Austin, BBC business correspondent

Supermarkets are used to spikes in demand, for example over the festive period. But they have usually been expecting them.

It has been clear from repeatedly emptied shelves that many shoppers have not heeded the official advice that there is no need to stockpile.

The BRC lobby group insists its members are resilient and there won't be long-term shortages. And supermarkets have adapted quickly. For example, Sainsbury's has told customers today that it has increased warehouse capacity and ordered more stock. Tesco is among the brands that will take up the government's offer of extending delivery hours to keep up with demand.

But with demand unprecedented for the time of year - weeks before the expected UK peak of the pandemic - this unusual joint letter from the major supermarkets shows they feel a strong message needs sending to customers. They will be hoping that the coordinated effort will help their strained supply chains cope and ensure everyone, including the most vulnerable, can get what they need.

Some food banks say they have a shortage of basic items which have already been panic bought by shoppers.

The government has said there is no need for anyone to stockpile items, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging people to ""behave responsibly and think about others"".

The government is relaxing restrictions on delivery hours for retailers to try to ensure shops remain stocked with basic items.

Deliveries to supermarkets are usually restricted overnight to avoid disturbing local residents.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said allowing night-time deliveries would allow stock to move more quickly from warehouses to shelves.

Meanwhile, the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog has warned retailers not to ""exploit"" fears about coronavirus by dramatically increasing the price of protective goods such as hand gels and face masks.

Local and mayoral elections in England will be postponed for a year to May 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Downing Street said it would be impractical to hold the elections as planned, as they would come during the peak of the spread of the virus.

Polls were due in 118 English councils, the London Assembly and for seven English regional mayors.

Voting was also due to take place for the London mayor and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.

It comes after the Electoral Commission said on Thursday the elections should be delayed until the autumn to ""mitigate"" the impact of the virus.

Meanwhile, visitor access to Parliament will be restricted from Monday, and MPs and peers are being ""strongly"" discouraged from making overseas trips.

Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said the ""proportionate and reasonable"" measures would help preserve the operation of Parliament during the outbreak.

Ten people have died with the virus, with 798 cases confirmed UK-wide.

The Cabinet Office said it would be bringing forward legislation to enact the elections delay in England, and would ensure the Welsh authorities had the same powers.

The last time elections were delayed was in 2001, when they took place one month late due to the foot and mouth outbreak.

Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the move to delay the polls was the ""right decision"".

But he added it was ""not clear"" why the government had opted for a year-long delay, rather than postpone until the autumn as the Electoral Commission recommended.

Before the postponement was announced, Labour had backed calls for a delay, adding it had ""serious concerns"" about the welfare of party staff and members.

Labour General Secretary Jennie Formby wrote to local party branches earlier on Friday advising them to suspend campaigning ahead of the polls.

Defending the decision to delay the polls, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said it was important ""everyone feels confident they are able to take part"".

""Respecting the annual cycle of local government, postponing them seems to me in the circumstance to be the right thing to do,"" he added.

'Uncharted territory'

James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ""The LGA has been raising a number of issues with government including the possible impact of coronavirus on local elections. The swift decision is very helpful.

""Councils will now continue to put all of their efforts into supporting their local communities as the nation tackles Covid-19.""

The decision to delay the polls was also backed by the Association of Electoral Administrators.

Its chief executive Peter Stanyon said: ""This is uncharted territory and our members have been raising significant concerns about the safe delivery of these elections.""

Political events delayed

Labour has cancelled the special conference in London at which it was due to announce the result of its leadership election on 4 April.

The party said on Thursday it would instead put on a ""scaled-back event"" instead.

The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and Welsh Labour have all cancelled their spring conferences due to the spread of the virus.

The SNP and Scottish Conservatives have also announced their spring conferences will be postponed.

Only one MP, health minister Nadine Dorries, has tested positive for the virus - but an increasing number are self-isolating after either feeling unwell or learning that colleagues they have recently mingled with now have the virus.

Speaking on Friday, Mr Buckland said there was currently ""no evidence"" to suggest that keeping Parliament open posed a ""public health issue in itself"".

The Prison Officers Association has compared conditions in England's prisons to those found on cruise ships and the Prison Governors Association has said cases of the virus are inevitable.

BBC News has seen advice issued to prisons, which says inmates who had contact with a known coronavirus patient should be isolated in single accommodation.

It is understood plans being drawn in up in Whitehall involve communicating regularly with inmates, making sure they can contact their families and providing extra materials - like books and magazines - to those isolating to try to avoid boredom.

The possibility of designating other buildings as prisons to cope with pressures has not been ruled out.

Senior figures do not believe large numbers of prisoners will have to be released to cope with any strain.

There is, however, significant concern about the impact on older prisoners with underlying health issues.

The EU has drafted a post-Brexit trade deal proposal, covering areas such as security, foreign policy and fisheries.

The 441-page draft legal text, seen by the BBC, was sent to the 27 EU states on Thursday night, ahead of being presented to the UK next week.

But the BBC's Adam Fleming said much of the draft will be rejected by the UK because of references to EU law.

The two negotiating teams were due to meet in London for talks, but that has been cancelled due to coronavirus.

A joint statement from the UK and EU said they were ""exploring alternative ways to continue discussions"", such as video conferencing.

The UK left the EU at the end of January and entered the so-called transition phase, where the country continues to abide by most of the bloc's rules while a trade deal is negotiated.

Boris Johnson has said if an agreement is not made by the end of 2020, the UK will leave without one and go on to World Trade Organisation rules.

But critics said such a move would be the equivalent of a ""no deal"" Brexit and would damage the UK economy.

Cabinet minister Michael Gove has also said the government could walk away from talks as early as June if a ""broad outline"" of a deal has not been agreed.

Asked if that position could change due to the threat of coronavirus outbreak causing delays, the PM's spokesman said the transition period would still end this year, adding: ""In UK law, a request for an extension is not possible.""

'Level playing field'

The draft legal text, called the ""New Partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom"", was drawn up by the European Commission.

The document includes a lot of blank sections and placeholders.

But it also makes a number of proposals, including:

A joint partnership council with 16 subcommittees, including one dedicated to the so-called ""level playing field""

Level playing field proposals on competition, taxation, labour and social protection, and the environment

Long term agreements over access to British waters for EU boats, with annual negotiations

Co-operation on data exchange and extradition, if the UK continues to implement the European Convention on Human Rights

The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the text ""shows [an] ambitious and comprehensive future relationship is possible"", adding: ""We must give ourselves every chance of success.""

But the UK government has already said it would not accept any alignment with EU laws as they are updated.

It has also rejected the EU's call for ""level playing field"" guarantees - where British companies would be given tariff-free access to the EU market if they do not undercut their rivals within the bloc.

However, the EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards.

The British negotiating team will take a red pen to large sections of this EU draft treaty.

They reject the idea of the deal referring to specific European laws.

They don't want the words ""European Court of Justice"" to appear anywhere.

And the proposal on fishing will be seen as limiting the UK's control of its own waters.

It will be worth scrutinising the text carefully, as there are lots of more technical areas of agreement that could form the basis of an eventual deal.

However, the two sides disagree on whether there should one big blockbuster deal or several smaller ones - and that's an argument that's potentially unsolvable.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51871155,BBC,Politics,TRUE

Parliament may still be open for business but the coronavirus crisis is rapidly changing life for MPs.

Although only one has so far tested positive - the health minister Nadine Dorries - an increasing number are choosing to self-isolate after either feeling unwell or learning that colleagues they have recently mingled with now have the virus.

New government advice recommends that people isolate if they develop symptoms themselves.

Security Minister James Brokenshire is working from home ""as a precaution"" for a week after attending a breakfast meeting in the United States with Australian counterpart Peter Dutton, who has since tested positive.

Edward Argar has insisted there has been no-let up in his vital work as a health minister despite voluntarily confining himself to his home, saying ""the red boxes are still coming"".

Conservative MP Dehenna Davison said she was secluding herself in line with the latest NHS guidance that anyone with a high temperature or a persistent cough should stay away from work for a week.

Posting a picture on Twitter of her laptop, diary and a packet of solpadeine, the Bishop Auckland MP said she was working remotely and in ""regular contact"" with her team, adding ""it's business as usual but just a bit more digital"".

Hundreds of MPs, whether they have shown any symptoms or not, are starting to grapple with how to continue to represent their constituents while scaling back their public engagements - potentially for a prolonged period.

Many, as a first step, have decided to postpone face-to-face constituency surgeries, which typically take place on a Friday and Saturday.

These are, arguably, the most important date in an MP's weekly diary - an opportunity for constituents to raise problems and talk confidentially.

Image copyright EPA Image caption MPs are using different platforms to keep in touch with their constituents

Ms Davison said postponing all face-to-face meetings was the ""responsible thing to do"" in the current climate.

Others have followed suit, including Bournemouth East MP Tobias Ellwood, who said he had made the ""profound"" decision to stop seeing constituents and also not to visit his elderly mother, who was recently discharged from hospital.

Although drop-in events are now off limits for many MPs, they are making clear that their constituents can still reach them by phone. Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, said he and his staff will ""continue to operate as normally as possible within the issued guidelines"".

Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, has been in self-isolation for several days but is continuing to deal with local casework over the phone as well as fulfilling her duties as the party's spokeswoman for employment rights.

""It is about making sure we function and keep up our support for people,"" she told the BBC. ""The issues that people have with benefits and housing are not going away.""

'Visibility'

The MP, who is currently in London, has not ruled out holding face-to-face meetings after she returns to her constituency. But she expects to ""remodel"" her working practices, doing more via Skype and other platforms.

""The whole thing about the visibility of MPs - that will change and we will play more of co-ordinating role. We must make sure we are de-escalating this, staying ahead of the curve, and putting in place procedures which will be resilient through the peak of the crisis.""

MPs who have self-isolated:

Labour's Lilian Greenwood and Alex Sobel became the first MPs to take action last month, after they attended a Westminster conference where one of the guests tested positive for Covid-19.

Neither of them developed symptoms and they both returned to work.

With events changing by the minute, MPs are having to make very careful judgements and, according to Rachael Maskell, ""there have been a lot of discussions on WhatsApp groups about the different decisions"" being taken.

Conservative David Johnston, the MP for Wantage, is contacting everyone booked in for his weekend surgery to see if they want to go ahead while his Banbury colleague Victoria Prentis is speaking to elderly and more vulnerable constituents.

Analysis

By Daniel Kraemer, BBC Political Research Unit

One of the priorities for the government in the next few weeks will be to pass emergency legislation to respond to the public health crisis.

To do this - without triggering emergency powers - Parliament must be open but it doesn't have to be fully attended.

Parliament needs to be ""quorate"" before it votes and make progress on legislation.

This means there need to be at least 40 MPs present. In the Lords, the number is 30.

And it doesn't matter how many for each party are there. So, theoretically, the government could make progress with just 11% of Conservative members in the House.

The Labour Party has repeatedly called for changes to be made to the law to allow people being affected by the coronavirus crisis to have access to statutory sick pay.

This is something that is expected to be contained in government legislation, which ministers say will be published in the coming week.

Liberal Democrat Tim Farron has said he will hold a special surgery over the phone for those in his Cumbrian constituency who are ""worried to go to a public event"".

""Naturally with the spread of coronavirus there may be people who would like to chat with me about an issue affecting them but feel uneasy about going to my public advice surgeries,"" he explained.

Others, including Tories Theresa Villiers and Chris Philp, have signalled they are determined to continue to meet their constituents in person.

Twitter row

The MP for Peterborough, Paul Bristow, has been criticised for going ahead with a surgery on Friday in a branch of McDonalds in the city. He told the BBC he did think about cancelling it but insisted he was following the government's current health advice.

And a row has broken out on Twitter between Ms Dorries and the wife of Conservative colleague Andrew Bridgen, who is self-isolating after developing a cough.

Nevena Bridgen has suggested the minister, who has praised the work of Public Health England, did not tell its contact tracers that she sat next to her husband in the Commons tea room before her diagnosis. This, she claims, has put her own baby and elderly mother at risk.

In response, Ms Dorries insisted she did not sit directly next to Mr Bridgen and had urged him to call the NHS 111 helpline.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51871125,BBC,Politics,TRUE

An SNP party worker has claimed Alex Salmond did an impression of a zombie before kissing her on both cheeks then trying to kiss her on the mouth.

The witness, known as Woman J, said the alleged incident - shortly before the independence referendum - had been ""like an awful nightmare"".

She also alleged that Mr Salmond later asked if she wanted to ""stay over"" at his Bute House residence.

Mr Salmond denies sexually assaulting Woman J in September 2014.

He has also pled not guilty to a further 13 charges of sexual assault against nine other women.

The alleged offences are all said to have happened when Mr Salmond was serving as Scotland's first minister and the leader of the SNP.

Woman J told the High Court in Edinburgh that she had been working with Mr Salmond in Bute House when she left the room to go to the toilet.

When she returned, she claimed to have ""utterly froze"" after finding Mr Salmond ""lying on the ground, between the dining table and the back of the sofa.""

She alleged that Mr Salmond had a pen and paper next to him, and told her to ""come here and work on this speech"".

Woman J said she lay on the ground some distance from Mr Salmond because she did not want to anger him.

The witness alleged that they were both working on the speech when ""out of the blue"" he asked: ""Have you seen that zombie movie?""

She claimed that Mr Salmond told her to stand up before he ""stretched his arms out straight towards me and did an impression of a zombie walking towards me"".

She added: ""He put his arms on my shoulders and leaned in to kiss me on one cheek and then proceeded to move me out of the way to kiss my other cheek.

""Then he leaned in to kiss me on the lips.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Woman J said the incident took place at Bute House

Woman J said she raised her arms to break his connection on her shoulders, and had attempted to act like nothing had happened.

But she alleged that Mr Salmond had later touched her briefly on the leg and face.

And she claimed he had said she could ""stay over"" if she wanted to - to which she had thought there was ""no way in hell I was"".

Under cross-examination from defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC, Woman J agreed that Mr Salmond was a ""touchy feely, tactile person"" who had sometimes kissed members of the public, and that she had thought that this was inappropriate.

Ms McCall put it to the witness: ""This incident with the zombie film, he says that never happened. You're going to tell me it did?""

Woman J replied: ""Yes"".

She also agreed that she had continued to work with Mr Salmond after the alleged incident.

Image copyright Jeff J Mitchell Image caption Defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC described Mr Salmond as a ""tactile person""

Earlier in the day's evidence, a former civil servant known as Woman K claimed that photographs were taken of her as Mr Salmond grabbed hold of her bottom.

She said the photographs were taken at an event at Stirling Castle shortly before Mr Salmond stood down as first minister in November 2014.

Woman K claimed that Mr Salmond had been ""very insistent"" that she have her photograph taken with him.

She alleged that, as they were standing in front of the photographer, Mr Salmond put his arm around her before he ""reached down and grabbed hold of my backside"".

Woman K said Mr Salmond had done this ""quite forcefully with his full hand"" and it had felt ""very deliberate"".

She said she had felt ""shock and disbelief"" but had tried to ""just keep smiling"".

She said: ""I just want to do my job and feel proud of myself doing my job and it felt like I was being demeaned.

""It was unprofessional but there was nothing I could do about it.""

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Gordon Jackson QC suggested that the alleged incident involving Woman K was not sexual

The court was shown a series of photographs of the woman with Mr Salmond.

She appeared to have her eyes shut in several of them, and to be looking at Mr Salmond in another.

Woman K told the court that she looked ""very embarrassed"" because of ""what had just happened"".

She said another photograph shown to the court showed a ""look of disbelief"" on her face.

The witness said she had no choice but to get on with her job, but the next day she told her manager what had happened ""to make sure he was aware"".

What has the trial heard so far?

Woman K later agreed with defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC when he put it to her that she had thought the alleged incident ""wasn't sexual, it was about power"".

She said: ""That was my interpretation. The first minister grabbed by backside because he could.""

She also agreed that she had once described Mr Salmond as ""genuinely concerned and nice"" when she became unwell at work.

And she agreed that she had phoned Mr Salmond the next day to thank him for helping her.

Woman K also said that she had already contacted the Scottish government before it set up a helpline for people to report any allegations of inappropriate behaviour.

But she agreed that at that stage she wanted the complaint to go through the government rather than the police.

Dozed off

A third complainer, a Scottish government civil servant known as Woman D, told the court that it was a ""fairly regular occurrence"" for Mr Salmond to put his hands on her bottom when they were walking together, and that he had touched her face, hair and arms.

She said it made her feel uncomfortable, but she had put up with it because ""he was the leader of the country"" and she was worried it would damage her career if she put in a complaint.

Woman D went on to claim that she had once dozed off while in a car with Mr Salmond during a foreign trip - and had felt ""shocked"" and ""pretty icky"" when she woke up to find him stroking her face.

And she alleged that Mr Salmond had reached out to touch her face in a lift, before a colleague knocked his hand away and said something like ""What do you think you are doing?""

Defence lawyer Gordon Jackson QC asked Woman D if she had once shown Mr Salmond a holiday picture of herself in a ""somewhat skimpy bikini"".

When she replied that she had only done so because Mr Salmond had asked to see her holiday photos, Mr Jackson replied: ""I take it you don't just take bikini photos? Why show him that one?""

Woman D replied: ""I don't know.""

Mr Salmond says he is innocent of all the allegations against him.

""Shouting and snarling"" is not the way to get judges to accept curbs to their powers, a former top judge has warned.

Lord Sumption said the judiciary was likely to accept ""reasonable"" measures to address government concerns they are meddling in politics.

But he said the government would be mistaken if it thought ""abuse"" was the way to ""get things done"".

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a review into the relationship between government and the courts.

Later this year, the government will launch a wide-ranging Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission to take an ""in depth"" look at the issue. There will also be a separate Royal Commission on the criminal justice process.

'Not revenge'

The 2019 Conservative manifesto said: ""We will ensure that judicial review is available to protect the rights of the individuals against an overbearing state, while ensuring that it is not abused to conduct politics by another means or to create needless delays.""

The government has so far released few details about how the commission will work and how far it wants to go in limiting the power of judges to overturn government decisions.

The commission will be overseen by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, working alongside Justice Secretary Robert Buckland and Attorney General Suella Braverman. Lord Sumption is reportedly being tipped by officials to be its chairman.

Image caption The Supreme Court's Article 50 ruling sparked a press backlash

Ministers believe questions need to be asked to ""clarify what it is a judicial review is for"", senior government sources say.

Some ministers have argued that judicial reviews should not be used as a substitute for the work of Parliament.

But they have said any reforms will not be ""revenge"" for controversial decisions over Brexit - instead saying it will be about making the system better.

The prime minster's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is also keen on limiting judicial review powers.

In 2015, he argued on his personal blog that ""major reform"" was needed but it was an ""extremely fraught"" and complex issue, and entangled with Human Rights law and how the civil service ""uses all this to enmesh ministers in management chaos to stop things they don't like"".

What are judicial reviews?

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Campaigners against a third Heathrow runway celebrate a court victory

A type of court case that allows members of the public to challenge the legality of a government decision

It can be a decision by a government department, a regulator, a local council and certain other public bodies

Judicial reviews can not overturn entire Acts of Parliament passed by MPs

Decisions can be challenged on the grounds that a minister did not have the power to make it, or the process leading up to it was unfair or irrational

A decision can also be overturned if a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with the Human Rights Act

Most cases do not get very far - in 2018 only 218 made it as far as a court hearing, out of 3,597 that were lodged

Of the cases that reached court, the government won 50% of them

Some members of the judiciary fear the government is seeking revenge for the Supreme Court's ruling in September that the government acted illegally in seeking to prorogue Parliament ahead of October's Brexit deadline.

More recently, ministers were left fuming when the Court of Appeal ruled against the removal of 25 foreign offenders scheduled to be on a deportation flight.

Lord Sumption, who was a Supreme Court justice between 2012 and 2018, has said he does not accept that the court overstepped the mark in September's prorogation judgement - or in a 2017 ruling forcing the government to hold a vote on triggering Article 50.

But he argued that courts were too often failing to distinguish between the legality of a minister's decision and ""cases where the judge simply does not like the underlying policy"". He said this was a particularly concern in immigration and benefit cases.

'Proper forum'

In a BBC Parliament lecture at King's College London, he said: ""We are only a democracy because ministers are answerable for the formation and execution of policy to Parliament.

""Parliament may not always be as effective as it should be. But the House of Commons is the only institutional means by which the electorate can influence policy.

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Gina Miller spearheaded two successful challenges to government policy

""The appropriation by the courts of the right to decide where the public interest lies cuts across demarcation lines which are fundamental to the democratic state.

""Parliament is the proper forum for political opposition to the government. The courts are not.""

The former judge also argued that any shake-up of Britain's constitution must include electoral reform arguing that the first-past-the-post system produced governments without broad support.

'Unnecessary hostility'

He also argued that some international treaties, such as the European Human Rights Convention, lacked democratic legitimacy.

He said there was ""every prospect that judicial cooperation will be forthcoming if the measures proposed are reasonable and directed only to the more overtly political manifestations of judicial activism"".

But he warned that any attempt to reform the judiciary - or any other institution with wide public support - would fail if the government was too confrontational in its approach.

""People tend to judge politicians by their tone as much as their substance. Abuse is not a useful tool of policy. Shouting and snarling provokes unnecessary hostility among the electorate which will ultimately doom the whole project.""

,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption There are real worries over the impact the virus will have on learning

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said keeping schools open in England is the ""best course of action"", despite fears about the coronavirus.

It comes as blanket school closures are being announced in European nations such as Spain, France and Ireland.

He told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that sending all pupils home would put a big strain on key workers who would also have to stay at home.

School leaders agreed keeping schools open was the right decision.

Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which is meeting for its annual conference, said head teachers would authorise absence if parents took the decision to keep their children off lessons.

'Exams worry'

He anticipated absences would be small in scale and similar to ""snow days"".

The government has said individual schools may be advised to shut by Public Health England if necessary.

Mr Barton said there was pressure from parents for more information and guidance about what might happen to national exams.

The exam season starts in early May, when the virus outbreak is expected to reach its peak, but exam regulators are urging schools to prepare for public exams as normal.

GCSE exams start in the second week of May and run until mid-June.

Mr Barton said many head teachers were facing questions about the exam season, and there was an urgent need for reassurance.

""Parents and pupils are worried about being the victim of something out of their control and are asking, 'Will I get into college or university?'""

Mr Williamson said: ""We're doing everything we can to make sure it's fair for students, we're having regular discussions with Ofqual.""

The government warned on Thursday that within weeks, whole households would be asked to self-isolate if one person showed symptoms consistent with coronavirus.

It is not clear exactly what this would mean for a teenager unable to sit their exams, but there are mechanisms for allocating marks in exceptional circumstances, which have been used before.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's James Gallagher explains the UK's Coronavirus 'delay' phase

The Welsh government has been advised that school closures are not an appropriate move at the moment, though the situation remains under review.

The Scottish government has also said school closures would not be an effective measure at this stage.

The Republic of Ireland's decision to close schools, colleges and public childcare facilities until 29 March is likely to affect businesses in Northern Ireland's border region that employ staff from the Irish Republic.

In the meantime, many schools will continue to assess how technology could be used to continue pupils' learning in the event of isolated closures.

Sharon Bruton, chief executive of the Keys Federation Academy Trust in Wigan, whose schools use an artificial-intelligence learning platform, said teachers could set assignments via email and social media accounts.

""Schools are adaptable and flexible places - I'm certain school leaders and curriculum leaders will be thinking about how teaching can continue for their students should this be an eventuality,"" she said.

""Educators are remarkably resilient and adaptable and I think part of our job is to meet the needs of our children and make sure they can thrive in challenging circumstances - and this [coronavirus outbreak] won't be any different.""

So the possibility of blanket school closures has been kicked down the road, but that doesn't remove the uncertainty entirely.

No head teacher can rule out the possibility their school could be affected at some point. More pressing is the likelihood that the peak in cases could coincide with exams due to begin in mid-May.

This might mean more households isolating, more teachers off work.

One option could be to move some exams to later in June, when fewer are traditionally scheduled to take place.

This would prolong the agony for teenagers, and their families, but could increase the chances of most being able to sit the exams that are the passport to the next stage of their life.

In the meantime, despite expert advice, some parents continue to call for school closures.

The exams watchdogs for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all urging teachers and students to prepare for the exams season as normal.

In Scotland, where exams start earlier than the rest of the UK, the Scottish Qualifications Authority said there was no change to the 2020 national-qualifications timetable.

""Current deadlines for coursework, and other assessments, remain in place,"" it added.

England's exams watchdog, Ofqual, said: ""We continue to work closely with exam boards, other regulators and the Department for Education and we have met to plan for a range of scenarios, as the public would expect.

""Our overriding priorities are fairness to students this summer and keeping disruption to a minimum.""

Qualifications Wales said: ""We will provide guidance on our website to reflect any specific arrangements that schools and colleges should put in place if required.""

Northern Ireland's Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) said there were ""a broad range of contingencies to ensure the smooth operation of examinations"", which would be updated if necessary.

,"Image copyright Charles McQuillan Image caption The RHI scheme paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating

Corrupt or malicious activity was not the cause of what went wrong with Northern Ireland's failed energy scheme.

The findings into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme were published on Friday.

It found the scheme was a ""project too far"" for the NI Executive and ""should never have been adopted"".

The scheme, which opened in 2012, paid businesses to switch from oil and gas to environmentally-friendly heating.

The 656-page report said that while there was ""unacceptable"" behaviour by some officials, ministers and special advisers, what went wrong was a ""compounding of errors and omissions over time and a failure of attention"".

Set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, the RHI closed to new entrants in 2016 amid concerns about the potential cost.

Those boilers used wood pellets, but the subsidy payment was higher than the cost of the fuel, creating an incentive to use the boilers to generate income.

It became known as ""cash for ash"".

Arlene Foster 'sorry for failings'

The scheme was introduced by then Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster.

Following the report's publication, Mrs Foster, now the first minister, repeated an apology for her ""failings in the implementation"" of the RHI scheme.

She added that she is ""determined to learn from my mistakes and to work to ensure that the mistakes and systematic failures of the past are not repeated"".

Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it was now the responsibility of the executive to ""put (the report's) recommendations into action to change the system"".

""We need effective government and we need good practice in terms of our handling of public finances and we need to ensure that an issue such as this... can never arise again,"" the Sinn Féin MLA said.

Mrs Foster had told the inquiry that she did not read the regulations before bringing them to the assembly.

The inquiry found: ""The minister, in presenting the regulations to the assembly and asking for their approval, should have read them herself.

""Not least because in the inquiry's view to so do is a core part of a minister's job.""

However, it has found that as enterprise minister, Mrs Foster was given inaccurate and misleading information.

The report also criticises the arrangement between Mrs Foster and her special advisor (Spad) Andrew Crawford.

It said the division of responsibility between them for reading and digesting important documents was ""ineffective and led to false reassurance on the part of the minister"".

The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), and in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), have come under heavy criticism.

The report finds that at the development stage ""insufficient care was taken within DETI to weigh properly the whole-life costs"" of the scheme.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The inquiry findings are the culmination of more than three years of work by a team led by Sir Patrick Coghlin

A draft regulatory impact assessment presented to Mrs Foster in 2012 ""lacked necessary cost information"".

The report noted that at this point she had already been ""incorrectly"" told by officials that the scheme provided ""the highest renewable heat output at the best value"".

The lack of record keeping was also highlighted.

It emerged during the inquiry that many meetings had not been minuted by civil servants.

""Basic administration and record keeping, normally the bedrock of the Civil Service, was on too many occasions lacking within DETI,"" it said.

""This contributed to uncertainty as to what discussions had actually taken place.""

What was the RHI scandal?

The RHI scheme paid 1,200 businesses to switch from oil and gas to what was meant to be environmentally-friendly heating, using wood pellet boilers. Some businesses put in multiple boilers.

It became known as ""cash for ash"" and a lack of cost controls meant it threatened a massive overspend on the Stormont budget.

The financial scandal led to the collapse of Northern Ireland's political institutions in 2017 and caused a three-year political stalemate. The political institutions were only reinstated in January 2020.

A public inquiry into the scheme was set up in 2017. It took evidence from high-profile politicians, civil servants and consultants who designed the scheme as well as administrators who ran it.

No expertise or support

Further criticism of the NICS said that having embarked on the RHI scheme, DETI did not ensure that ""adequate resources and expertise were applied to its development"".

""Those junior civil servants responsible for the scheme day-to-day, no matter how hardworking and well-intentioned, were consistently under resourced.

""They were not equipped with the necessary expertise, nor adequately supported.""

A ""wholesale and uncoordinated changeover of staff"" who had knowledge of the scheme within DETI should not have been allowed to happen between 2013 and 2014.

In 2015, when problems were recognised, the actions of senior civil servants were not good enough to ensure they were identified and addressed.

The inquiry also found that the whistleblower who repeatedly contacted DETI with her concerns should have been treated better.

Janette O'Hagan repeatedly contacted DETI between 2013 and 2015 to highlight abuse of the scheme, but her warnings were overlooked.

The report said her treatment ""fell well below the standard she was entitled to expect"".

It also said there were ""instances of unacceptable behaviour by Spads"", highlighting one who shared confidential government documents, not just about RHI, with family members.

Another instance involved a number of Spads and a minister, discussing a plan to disclose information to divert media attention away from their party.

Inadequate governance

The ""unsatisfactory"" relationship between DETI and Ofgem, the scheme's administrator, was also highlighted.

The service Ofgem provided to the department ""fell below that standard that DETI could reasonably have expected"".

The report said Ofgem had relevant information about scheme exploitation and did not pass this information on.

This failure of communication ""deprived DETI of important opportunities to be confronted with or reminded of the problems of the scheme"".

Ultimately the report finds that ""responsibility for what went wrong lay not just with one individual or group but with a broad range or persons and organisations involved"".

""There were repeated missed opportunities to identify and correct, to seek or have others correct, the flaws in the scheme.

""The sad reality is, that in addition to a significant number of individual shortcomings, the very governance, management and communication systems, which in these circumstances should have provided early warning of impending problems and fail safes against such problems, proved inadequate.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-51840287,BBC,Politics,TRUE

The government says it wants to ""raise the bar"" on smart motorway safety, following criticism of the scheme.

Under the plan, opening motorway hard shoulders for traffic in busy periods will be scrapped.

On those smart motorways where the hard shoulder has been removed entirely, there will be an increase in places for vehicles to stop in an emergency.

Between 2015 and 2018, 11 people a year on average have died on smart motorways in England.

Announcing the plan to improve smart motorway safety, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had been ""greatly concerned by a number of deaths on smart motorways, and moved by the accounts of families who've lost loved ones in these tragic incidents"".

""The overall evidence shows that in most ways smart motorways are as safe or safer than conventional ones - but they are not in every way,"" he said.

A Freedom of Information (FoI) request sent by the BBC's Panorama to Highways England revealed that in one section of the M25, outside London, the number of near misses had risen 20-fold since the hard shoulder was removed in April 2014.

In the five years before the road was converted into a smart motorway, there were just 72 near misses. In the five years after, there were 1,485.

Jim O'Sullivan, the chief executive of Highways England, said: ""Every death in any road accident is tragic, and we are determined to do all we can to make our roads as safe as possible.""

There are two types of smart motorway in the UK.

The first is where the hard shoulder is opened to traffic when it is busy. The second is where the hard shoulder is open all the time and drivers who break down are encouraged to pull into emergency stops.

In addition to abolishing the ""confusing"" dynamic hard shoulder, the government has said it will also reduce the distance between places to stop in an emergency to three quarters of a mile where possible.

It says this will mean on future schemes, motorists should typically reach a stop every 45 seconds at 60mph. The maximum spacing will be one mile.

The government's plan also includes measures to:

Installing 10 additional emergency areas on the existing M25 smart motorway section

Speeding up the deployment of technology to detect 'stopped vehicles'

Making emergency areas more visible

Introducing more traffic signs giving the distance to the next place to stop in an emergency

Committing £5m to a communications campaign to increase awareness of how smart motorways work

Mr Shapps acknowledged the changes would cost ""quite a lot of money"", adding it could reach ""hundreds of millions of pounds"".

""Nothing is more important to me than making sure our road networks are completely safe,"" he said.

Meera Naran, whose son died on a smart motorway, welcomed the changes saying: ""I feel like this is a small mother's day present from Dev wherever he is.""

RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said it was welcome that the government had listened to drivers' concerns but added ""it remains to be seen if these measures go far enough to protect drivers"".

While the AA's Edmund King said the changes were ""a victory for common sense and road safety"".

But Labour MP Sarah Champion said the proposals did not ""go far enough"" and called on the government to restore smart motorways ""to traditional operation"".

She accused Mr Shapps of ""allowing these lethal roads to continue to operate"".

Image copyright Meera Naran Image caption Eight-year-old Dev Naran (left) was killed on a smart motorway when he was on his way home from visiting his critical ill brother (right).

Smart motorways were introduced with the aim of increasing capacity and easing congestion by using the hard shoulder as an extra lane.

But they have been criticised by the government minister who originally approved the roll-out in 2010.

Speaking to Panorama in January, Sir Mike Penning, who is no longer a minister, said he had been misled about the risks of taking away the hard shoulder.

The Conservative MP said he had agreed to the expansion in 2010 after a successful pilot on the M42 near Birmingham.

The pilot worked well because there were safe stopping points for motorists, called emergency safety refuges, on average every 600 metres.

But when the scheme was expanded across the country, the safety refuges were placed further apart - on some sections, they are 2.5 miles apart.

""They are endangering people's lives,"" said Sir Mike. ""There are people that are being killed and seriously injured on these roads, and it should never have happened.""

Responding to his comments, Highways England said the plans to expand smart motorways were approved by ministers and that it was working to gather the facts about safety.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51851421,BBC,Politics,TRUE

The Budget measures to tackle the coronavirus are substantial, but limited, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).

The IFS gave its assessment the day after the chancellor announced a £12bn package to mitigate the economic effects of the virus.

It also warned that working from home would be harder for factory workers than for those in office jobs.

And many self-employed people would still not be entitled to sick pay.

""Mr Sunak will certainly want to monitor the effectiveness of the package and be ready to come back with more if necessary,"" the IFS said.

""This is a substantial package, well targeted at what it is seeking to achieve. It is, though, necessarily limited,"" it said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his first Budget to the Commons on Wednesday

""On the business side, it is aimed particularly at those businesses which might face a demand shock - those in hospitality, retail and so on.

""It does much less for those that might end up having to reduce production or close temporarily because staff can't come into work, either because they are ill, self-isolating or looking after children who have been sent home from school.""

'Very weak' forecasts

The IFS also described the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecasts for the UK economy as ""very weak"", even before factoring in long-term effects from the coronavirus.

GDP growth is the percentage change of how fast an economy is growing or shrinking over time.

The OBR said the growth rate was expected to dip to 1.1% this year, before picking back up to 1.8% in 2021.

The IFS called these projections ""feeble"" and said that the economy was ""not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus"".

Robert Chote, the OBR's chairman, said on Wednesday that given the severity of the outbreak, risks that the forecasts might need to be downgraded further were ""all too clear"", although the threat was difficult to quantify.

'Right economic thing to do'

Large rises in public spending also mean that general government spending will contribute more than half of GDP growth this year and the next.

Image caption The coronavirus is leading to shortages of hygiene items

The increased spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

But Chancellor Rishi Sunak defended his plans for the UK economy, saying that borrowing was the ""right economic thing to do"".

Borrowing more money to invest into the UK is ""the right economic thing to do"", the chancellor has said.

Rishi Sunak told the BBC that interest rates were at a ""multi-decade low"" and he was ""not going to make an apology"" for the Budget - which included a £30bn package of investment.

The Bank of England announced a cut in interest rates on Wednesday.

But the Resolution Foundation warned of a £575 a year blow to households, even before the impact of coronavirus.

The think tank said the mark down of the UK economy by the Office of Budget Responsibility, without taking the outbreak into account, was ""incredibly grim and yet still unbelievably optimistic"".

Its chief executive, Torsten Bell, said: ""In reality, once we take the economic impact of coronavirus into account, this is the weakest official growth outlook on record.""

Labour's John McDonnell told the BBC's Today programme he welcomed more investment from the government, but ""10 years of austerity brought the country to our knees"" and the Budget was ""only going part way to making up"" for Tory cuts.

The chancellor said the plans he laid out on Wednesday were a ""significant step change"" for the government and the amount it would invest in infrastructure.

As well as a £5bn emergency response fund for the NHS and a number of other measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, he announced spending of more than £600bn on roads, rail, housing and broadband across the next five years.

But questioned over the OBR's low growth forecasts in the short term, Mr Sunak said the organisation had praised the government's long-term investment plans.

""We can look at that as see we are on the right track with the plans we are doing, and it will start to have an immediate effect on people,"" he told Today.

'Unprecedented'

Former Prime Minister Theresa May urged ""restraint and caution"" on spending after the Budget announcement.

She told the Commons: ""Although spending a lot of money may be popular and may seem the natural thing to do, there is, of course, that necessity to have a realistic assessment of the longer term impact of those decisions and of the longer term consequences.

""It is also necessary to ensure that we have that restraint and caution that enables us to make the public finances continue to be strong into the future.""

Mr Sunak defended his plans, saying he would be sticking to the fiscal rules set out in his the Tory's election manifesto.

""But we are going to take advantage of these historically and unprecedented very low interest rates to invest in the long-term productivity of our economy,"" he said.

""That is, I think, the right economic thing to do, whilst overall having stable management of our debt.""

Mr Sunak added: ""I am not going to make an apology for responding at scale in a comprehensive fashion to the immediate challenges we face from coronavirus. I do think that is the right thing to do.""

This is a new government with a new chancellor much hungrier for spending, much hungrier for borrowing and much less bothered about the size of the national debt - and we are talking about very, very big numbers here.

The case the government makes is: it is coherent and correct to do this as it is dead cheap for governments to borrow in the long term.

Rishi Sunak believes that what started off as a temporary, extraordinary period of low interest rates is basically now locked in for the long term.

It is the economic and political fashion now to think it is going to be a long-term situation, therefore if borrowing is so cheap, why wouldn't you want to be more flash with the cash?

But with respect to the economists, sometimes their crystal balls are a bit wonky, things can change, and some Conservatives on the backbenches believe this may not be the time to run up a new, additional, huge overdraft.

However, the government's judgement is 'now is the time' - not least because they want to be able to keep the very many promises they have made to electorate.

Easy budgets are ones where you stand up and write big cheques. But sometimes they pave the way for much harder budgets in the years to come.

The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts.

More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the release of Home Office research into the ""characteristics"" of grooming gangs.

The government has refused to release the information, telling The Independent it was ""not in the public interest"" to do so.

The issue will now be considered for a debate in Parliament, having passed the required number of signatures.

The Home Office said work on the issue was ""ongoing"".

In 2018, the then Home Secretary Sajid Javid ordered research into the ""characteristics and contexts"" of gangs abusing children, arguing that ignoring issues such as ethnicity is more likely to fuel the far-right.

He said he wanted officials researching the causes of gang-based exploitation to leave ""no stone unturned"".

The review came after grooming gangs were convicted in Huddersfield, Oxford, and Rotherham.

But the Independent reported last month that the government was refusing to release the research, saying it was not in the ""public interest"" in response to the publication's Freedom of Information request.

The petition, on the UK government and Parliament petitions website, reads: ""We, the British public, demand the release of the official research on grooming gangs undertaken by the government in full.

""Sajid Javid promised the review as home secretary in July 2018, pledging that there would be 'no no-go areas of inquiry'.

Parking on pavements could be banned in England to help pedestrians, the Department for Transport has said.

With the exception of London - where a ban already exists - only lorries are currently prevented from pavement parking.

The government is to open a consultation on whether to give local authorities more parking powers.

The AA, however, has warned a ban could have ""unintended consequences"" and cause more widespread ""parking chaos"".

The consultation comes after a committee of MPs last year called for a nationwide ban on the ""blight"" of parking on pavements.

Witnesses told the Commons' transport committee that the worst cases of pavement parking were effectively trapping disabled, elderly and vulnerable people, making them ""afraid to leave their homes"".

The cross-party group said blocked-off walkways were also exacerbating the issue of loneliness in Britain.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Vehicles parked on the pavement can cause very real difficulties for many pedestrians.""

He said the consultation would look at a variety of options, including giving local authorities extended powers to crack down on this behaviour.

Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the transport committee, welcomed the consultation, noting that the government had promised in 2015 to look into the issue but consultations and reviews had failed to improve roadside conditions.

""This government has signalled an intent to finally deliver change,"" he said, adding that detailed timings were needed.

London's ban

While ministers consider outlawing pavement parking across England, a ban has been in place in London since 1974.

One of its main aims is to prevent pedestrians, including wheelchair users, people with baby buggies and the visually impaired, from being obstructed.

But it is also about limiting damage to footways - unlike roads, pavements are not designed to take the weight of vehicles.

The rules apply to almost all streets in London at all times, and those who flout them can be given a parking ticket of up to £100 and be towed away - even if just one or two wheels are parked on the footway.

Exceptions to the ban include vehicles that have been exempted by councils and for unloading or loading when there is no other method available.

It is a widespread issue - a YouGov survey in 2018 found 65% of drivers admitted to having previously parked on the pavement.

'Unintended consequences'

The AA said it agreed that people who park in an anti-social way should be penalised.

But it added: ""An outright ban could lead to unintended consequences with parking chaos becoming more widespread.

""A better solution would be for councils to make a street-by-street assessment and where pavement parking could be allowed it be clearly marked and signed.""

Internet companies must do more to tackle ""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuse on their platforms, a UK-held inquiry has concluded.

The panel also said the technology companies had ""failed to demonstrate"" they were fully aware of the number of under-13s using their services and lacked a plan to combat the problem.

It has called for all images to be screened before publication.

And it said more stringent age checks were also required.

'Reputational damage'

Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were identified as the most commonly cited apps where grooming was said to take place.

And the industry at large was accused of being ""reactive rather than proactive"" in response to the issues.

""Action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children,"" the inquiry said.

The report follows a series of public hearings, between January 2018 and May 2019, during which the police said they believed the UK was the world's third biggest consumer of live-streamed child sex abuse.

'Evil crime'

Facebook was one of the first to respond.

""[We] have made huge investments in sophisticated solutions,"" said its European head of safety, David Miles.

""As this is a global, industry-wide issue, we'll continue to develop new technologies and work alongside law enforcement and specialist experts in child protection to keep children safe.""

Microsoft also promised to ""consider these findings carefully"", while Google said it would keep working with others to ""tackle this evil crime"".

Illegal imagery

The report said some steps should be taken before the end of September.

Leading its list is a requirement for screening before images appear online.

The report noted technologies such as Microsoft's PhotoDNA had made it possible for pictures to be quickly checked against databases of known illegal imagery without humans needing to look at them.

But at present, this filtering process typically happened after the material had already become available for others to see.

Officially banned

Users might be frustrated by a delay in seeing their content go live but, the panel said, it had not been told of any technical reason this process could not happen before publication.

The inquiry also said the UK government should introduce legislation to compel the companies involved to adopt more effective checks to deter under-age users.

Pre-teens were at ""particularly acute"" risk of being groomed, it said.

The panel recognised many services were officially banned to under-13s.

Child nudity

But it said in many cases, the only test was to require users to fill in a date-of-birth form, which could easily be falsified.

""There must be better means of ensuring compliance,"" it said.

The report acknowledged detecting and preventing the live-streaming of abuse was difficult but highlighted a French app as an example to learn from.

It said Yubo used algorithms to detect possible instances of child nudity, which a human moderator would then check to see if action if necessary.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled a £30bn package to boost the economy and get the country through the coronavirus outbreak.

He is suspending business rates for many firms in England, extending sick pay and boosting NHS funding.

In his first Budget speech, he warned of a ""significant"" but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: ""We will get through this together.""

The Bank of England has announced an emergency cut in interest rates.

Mr Sunak, who was promoted to chancellor just four weeks ago after Sajid Javid quit the government, has had to hastily re-write the government's financial plans to deal with coronavirus.

""We are doing everything we can to keep this country and our people healthy and financially secure,"" he told MPs.

Of the £30bn in extra spending, £12bn will be specifically targeted at coronavirus measures, including at least £5bn for the NHS in England and £7bn for business and workers across the UK.

This is on top of other spending pledges that will amount to £18bn next year, and even more in following years.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said extra spending on government departments and investment represented the biggest Budget ""giveaway"" since 1992, and will add around £100bn to public borrowing by 2024.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he welcomed many of the measures to ""head off the impact"" of coronavirus, which has now been labelled a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

But he said the extra money for the NHS was ""too little, too late"" and the UK was going into the crisis with its public services ""on their knees"" after years of Conservative cuts.

Measures to mitigate the effect of the coronavirus outbreak include:

Statutory sick pay for ""all those who are advised to self-isolate"" even if they have not displayed symptoms

Business rates for shops, cinemas, restaurants and music venues in England with a rateable value below £51,000 suspended for a year

A £500m ""hardship fund"" to be given to local authorities in England to help vulnerable people in their areas

A ""temporary coronavirus business interruption loan scheme"" for banks to offer loans of up to £1.2m to support small and medium-sized businesses

The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus

Plans to make it quicker and easier to get benefits for those on zero hours contracts

Benefit claimants who have been advised to stay at home will not have to physically attend job centres

The number of coronavirus cases in the UK reached 460 on Wednesday, with an eighth person confirmed to have died after contracting the virus.

The chancellor said that without accounting for the impact of coronavirus, the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.1% in 2020, the slowest rate since 2009.

Despite speculation that he would ditch the framework on spending set by predecessor Mr Javid, Mr Sunak said his Budget is delivered ""not just within the fiscal rules of the manifesto but with room to spare"".

The chancellor has scrapped a planned cut in corporation tax and scaled back a tax break for entrepreneurs, saving £6bn over the next five years.

The spending in this Budget is being largely paid for with a big increase in government borrowing.

Big increases in borrowing

The government expects to borrow almost £100bn more in this Parliament (before mid-2024) than was expected the last time we had any forecasts.

And that figure does not include £12bn to be spent on getting the economy through the coronavirus outbreak.

The Treasury documents say that money will be accounted for in the next Budget in the autumn.

In other Budget measures, the chancellor announced that fuel duty would be frozen for another year.

A planned increase in spirits duty will be cancelled and duties for cider and wine drinkers in England will be frozen as well, but a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 27p more.

The so-called tampon tax will be abolished, and VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journals will be scrapped from 1 December.

And the chancellor pledged to more than double spending on UK government research and development by 2024.

The chancellor announced more than £600bn for road, rail, housing and broadband projects over five years, aimed at delivering on the Conservatives' election promise to boost economic growth outside of London and the south-east of England.

He announced plans for Treasury offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and a ""new economic campus in the north, with over 750 staff from the Treasury"".

He also promised an additional £640m for the Scottish government, £360m for the Welsh government, £210m for the Northern Ireland executive and £240m for new city and growth deals.

Mr Sunak said he was providing £200m for local communities in England to build flood resilience and would double investment in flood defences.

The chancellor will deliver another Budget in the Autumn, with measures aimed at preparing the UK economy for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the EU.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics found that the UK economy did not grow at all in January.

,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McDonnell: I'm absolutely worried about social care

Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says the government's Budget has offered ""nothing"" to tackle the ""social care crisis"".

He told the BBC it would be difficult to ""rebuild"" social care services to cope with the coronavirus outbreak.

He said he was ""worried"" about the future, but he welcomed extra funding to help the NHS.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said social care will get ""everything it needs"" to respond to the outbreak.

Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced at least £5bn this year for the NHS in England to help it cope with the spread of the virus.

Mr Hancock told MPs the extra cash was for ""social care too"", telling MPs that adult social care ""will be at the front line of our response"".

It comes after Mr Hancock wrote to MPs last week to start cross-party talks to find a long-term solution on how social care should be funded.

The talks were a pledge in the Conservative election manifesto, which also promised an extra £1bn per year for social care in England over the next five years.

According to NHS Digital, 841,850 people were receiving long-term care in England in 2018. An ageing population is expected to increase demand.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Neil Show, Mr McDonnell said he would support any ""effective"" plan to emerge from the talks.

But he accused ministers of having failed to ""seriously"" acknowledge pressures faced by the sector, and failing to ""learn the lessons"" from budget cuts to public services over the last 10 years.

""There's nothing for social care today,"" he added, referring to the Budget.

""If you don't tackle the social care crisis, we're going to have real problems - not just immediately but for the long-term future"".

Earlier, former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted he failed to solve issues relating to social care whilst in office.

Writing on Twitter, he added that the sector ""desperately"" needed a long-term plan to go alongside the 10-year NHS England blueprint unveiled last year.

""Hospitals will continue to fill up, and the winter crisis will be annual until we fix this issue,"" he added.

'Astounding omission'

Speaking after the Budget was delivered, acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the spending plans did not do ""anything"" for social care.

""We have a care sector on its knees. Care homes are closing and there are shortages of care staff,"" he said.

""It is an astounding omission.""

Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund think tank, said adult social care remained a ""pressing and overlooked"" issue.

He added that it was ""hugely disappointing"" the Budget ""does not include an emergency cash injection to help local government to address social care needs beyond coronavirus.""

Social care is a devolved issue. In Scotland, the SNP has said if it is re-elected in 2021 it would scrap all non-residential social care charges.

Plaid Cymru has said social care in Wales should be free at the point of need and funded from general taxation.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51844778,BBC,Politics,TRUE

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has braced the UK for ""quite extraordinary interventions that you don't normally have in peacetime"" to combat the coronavirus pandemic. But what are these interventions and how will they change the NHS?

1. Hotel room or hospital ward?

Image copyright Steve Parsons/PA Wire Image caption A Holiday Inn hotel near Heathrow Airport has been reserved by the government for people arriving from abroad to self-isolate

The health secretary said empty hotels across the country would help ease the pressure on hospitals that are filling up with patients.

""Some people are saying: 'Should you build a hospital?'"" Mr Hancock told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

""Actually, we've seen that many hotels are empty so we've got ready-built facilities for looking after people.""

Asked about whether military field hospitals might also be used to spread the load, Mr Hancock said: ""I'm open to all options.""

He said he was more concerned that enough staff members and equipment were available to cope with an influx in patients, rather than worrying about where those patients would go to receive care.

""The critical thing is that [the hotels] need oxygen supply and the ventilation equipment - whether it's the invasive ventilation or just the mask on your face.

""So what matters is not just the space, it's making sure that the equipment and the trained staff are there as well.""

Hotel chain Best Western said it was considering turning some of its properties into temporary hospitals to help the NHS.

Chief executive Rob Paterson said Best Western would discuss the idea this week and ""would be willing to take unprecedented steps to support the national effort"".

The chain reported an increase in cancellations over the last month as a result of the pandemic.

2. NHS or private hospital?

The Labour Party and the GMB union have called on the government to use empty beds in ""plush private hospitals"" to ease the pressure on the NHS.

Downing Street confirmed on Sunday that the health service would buy up thousands of beds in private hospitals if they were needed to cope with a surge in patient numbers.

The government said ""negotiations"" with private healthcare providers have already begun.

But the GMB union is calling for these beds to be given to the NHS for free.

""This is a public health emergency, not a business opportunity for shoddy private healthcare chums to profiteer from distress,"" said GMB's Rehana Azam.

3. Ventilators made at car factories

How will thousands of new ventilators - machines needed to help patients breathe - be made quickly enough to cope with an increase in demand?

Mr Hancock said there were 5,000 ventilators available in the UK at the moment but that many times that number would be needed as the number of people with Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, increased.

Asked if the likes of military engineers and car manufacturers would be asked to meet the demand, the health secretary said: ""Yes, we're talking to all those companies.""

""We've got high quality engineering in this country. And we want anybody who has the manufacturing capability to turn to the manufacture of ventilators to do that,"" he added.

The speedy manufacturing might not stop once the UK has enough ventilators either, with Mr Hancock suggesting the equipment could be sent abroad to help other countries in need.

Digger manufacturing company JCB confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson had asked if they could help to make ventilators.

Chairman Lord Bamford said the British company - which cut production and working hours in February as coronavirus led to a shortage of components - would do ""whatever we can to help during the unprecedented times our country is facing"".

4. Operating theatres converted into wards

The cancellation of swathes of non-urgent - or ""elective"" - surgery will help to free up space, Mr Hancock said.

He said the sorts of operations that could be delayed ""in this emergency"" situation included hip and knee operations.

Operating theatres where these procedures are normally carried out are equipped with oxygen supplies, meaning they ""can be turned into wards"" for coronavirus patients.

This measure is ""one of the first things that we're going to do"", he added.

5. New (and old) staff

Image copyright Jeff Overs/BBC Image caption Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Andrew Marr how hospitals would change as the UK waged war on the virus

All those extra ventilators will throw up another problem - there are not enough trained nurses and doctors to operate them.

To fix this, Mr Hancock said the government wanted to bring recently-retired doctors ""back into service"".

But, the health secretary said, some of those workers would need to be trained up to deal with the specific needs of Covid-19 - which is a respiratory disease,

""We will be stopping some other activity, and asking doctors who normally do other things to retrain to be able to, for instance, use the ventilators.""

"['Marco Silva', 'In-Depth Reporting On Social Media']","A leak of confidential UK government documents in the run-up to last December's general election has been blamed on Russian actors. But what evidence is there to say the Russian government itself tried to interfere in British politics?

With just about two weeks to go before election day, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn revealed a trove of confidential documents outlining talks between UK and US officials about a possible future trade deal.

The leak fuelled a debate about the future of the NHS and made the headlines for days, particularly after evidence emerged blaming Russians for the leak.

But a key question remains unanswered, three months after the vote: Was the Russian government directly involved?

Reddit and the elusive 'Gregoratior'

The 451-page trove of documents first emerged online in October.

A user going by the name ""Gregoratior"" posted a link to the documents on discussion website Reddit, suggesting the publication would ""make some noise"".

Image copyright Reddit

It didn't at first: only a small number of Reddit users noticed the post and commented on it.

On Twitter, politicians and journalists also failed to immediately notice the leak, despite repeated attempts by a Twitter account, again with the handle ""Gregoratior"", to get their attention. Since then, the account has been suspended.

BBC Trending

The programme that takes an investigative look at social media, from the BBC World Service.

Listen to our investigation 'Did Russia leak British secrets online?'

With less than a week to go before the election, Reddit released a statement linking the ""Gregoratior"" account to a known disinformation campaign coming out of Russia.

The website banned the account, along with 60 other related accounts suspected of misusing the platform and engaging in what they called ""influence operations"".

We asked Reddit if we could examine the evidence the company holds linking these accounts to Russian operators - but they declined to show us.

Image copyright Press Association Image caption Jeremy Corbyn: ""At no stage did the prime minister or anybody deny that those documents were real""

It also remains unclear how the Labour Party got hold of the leaked documents. At the time, they did not reveal their source, and they did not respond to BBC Trending's recent requests for comment.

At the time of the leak, Mr Corbyn described suggestions that Labour might have benefited from a Russian operation as ""nonsense"".

'Operation Secondary Infektion'

But there is stronger evidence pointing to the involvement of Russian hackers - albeit not conclusive proof that the Kremlin itself is involved.

Last year, Facebook shut down dozens of accounts, pages and groups run from Russia for engaging in what the company described as ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"".

They were linked to what the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), part of the Atlantic Council think tank, would later identify as ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" - a disinformation campaign stemming from Russia.

Through a network of bogus social media accounts, this campaign tried to spread forged documents and false news stories that, according to DFRLab, ""attacked Western interests and unity"".

Image copyright FunnyJunk.com Image caption Among the forged stories were suggestions that Spanish intelligence was aware of a Remainer plot to kill Boris Johnson

Often translated into several languages, many of these stories were published on websites open to contributions from the public.

When the leak of UK-US trade documents hit the headlines, open-source investigators noticed how the files were published and distributed online. Soon, the similarities with ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" became evident.

""The tradecraft was absolutely identical,"" says Ben Nimmo, who worked on the original DFRLab report and is currently head of investigations at US company Graphika.

Nimmo outlined the similarities between the earlier operation and the UK leaks in a report released in December.

""The same type of pages were being used, similar username strategies were being used,"" says Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. ""It either is an actor who is replicating these efforts or it is the same actor.""

Image copyright Reddit Image caption Another forged story which was part of the operation suggested the Real IRA had posted an Arabic-language invitation to Islamist fighters online

There was however one key difference: while ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" spread false stories based on forged documents - often clear and preposterous fakes - the ""Gregoratior"" leak of trade talk documents seems authentic.

The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, but no government official has yet denounced them as forgeries.

""The big question is still: How did internal UK government documents end up on Reddit in the first place?"" says Mr Nimmo.

Due to the possibility that hackers may have been involved in gaining access to the documents, the National Cyber Security Centre is currently investigating.

Moscow denies involvement in leaks

While the evidence points back to Russian territory, it is far more difficult to determine who specifically was carrying out the operation and, more importantly, on whose orders.

""It was sophisticated, it was well resourced,"" says Mr Nimmo. ""The likeliest candidate is either some form of Russian state operator or some proxy of the Russian state operators."" But he and several other experts stop short of drawing a definitive line to the Russian government.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference

""Yes, Russia does have that strategy in their playbook,"" Ms Neudert says. ""But it could also be private actors, some sort of hacker collective, it could be some sort of tech-savvy trolling... There are many kinds of actors that are hacking private information.""

The Russian Embassy in London denied any links to either ""Operation Secondary Infektion"" or the leak of UK-US trade documents.

Other experts warned that an exclusive focus on Russia could deflect attention from other campaigns.

""Russia has a habit of trying to interfere in western countries' elections,"" says Elisabeth Braw, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank. ""They are extremely good at corrupting our public discourse.""

""But we have a situation where it's very easy to blame Russia,"" Ms Braw says. ""That is extremely dangerous, because we neglect to examine the activities of other countries that want to weaken our societies, such as China, North Korea, or Iran.""

In October, the UK Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee completed a report outlining the various ways in which Russia has recently tried to interfere with British democracy.

Downing Street delayed the publication of the report, prompting accusations that it might be trying to suppress its key conclusions. Number 10 denies the accusation and says a normal timetable has been followed.

Publication is now expected later this year, once a new Intelligence and Security Committee has been appointed.

"['Nick Triggle', 'Health Correspondent']","Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Up to 10,000 in UK ""likely to have coronavirus"" - chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance

Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and a major epidemic is expected.

A worst case scenario could see 80% of people infected if nothing is done.

What is the UK now doing about coronavirus?

The UK government is attempting to delay the spread of coronavirus and reduce the epidemic's peak (when the number of cases is highest).

It says that from Friday:

All people with flu-like symptoms - a fever above 37.8C or a persistent cough - should self-isolate (stay at home, away from other people) for seven days

Schools should not take trips abroad

Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions should avoid cruises

Further measures will be taken as the number of coronavirus infections moves towards its peak:

Everyone over 70 will be told ""within the coming weeks"" to stay at home for an extended period

If someone in your home falls ill, the whole household will be told to isolate itself for 14 days

It is hoped these steps could significantly reduce the number of infections and cut deaths by up to a third.

Could schools close and public gatherings be banned?

The government has other powers it could use to protect people from infection:

School closures and - once a new law is passed - allowing bigger class sizes if there are teacher shortages

Restrictions on the use of public transport

Stopping big gatherings

Troops supporting the emergency services

Police focusing on the most serious crimes and maintaining public order

New legal powers to make people stay in quarantine

Some other countries like Italy have already taken some of these measures, but they tend to have more cases.

And officials in the UK have concerns about how effective they will be.

For example, while school closures could reduce the peak, forcing parents to stay at home would be a problem. It could reduce the number of health workers available, or mean grandparents - one of the at-risk groups - stepping in.

Is the NHS ready for coronavirus?

Up to one in five UK workers could be off sick during a major outbreak, the government says.

It thinks there could be more deaths, especially among elderly people and those with health conditions like heart or lung problems and diabetes.

There are 30 hospitals on stand-by to take patients, but all of the NHS is on an emergency footing.

Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits.

All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested.

If someone tests positive, they may be moved to one of the main hospitals, if that's best for them.

Patients with mild symptoms are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be.

But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried.

How will the NHS treat seriously ill patients?

Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms.

Specialist equipment called ECMO - which helps breathing - is at five units for patients whose lungs fail.

The government wants to get more ventilators into the health system and is working with suppliers in the UK and abroad to increase the supply. It will also ask British manufacturers to help produce more ventilators in the UK ""at speed"".

If there is widespread transmission, hospitals could start cancelling routine treatments to prioritise coronavirus patients.

It is estimated one in 20 patients may become critically ill, which could overwhelm the NHS. There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds, which can be increased. By how much is not clear.

Doctors warn some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment.

What is the UK hoping to achieve?

Apart from putting less pressure on the NHS, delaying the peak to the summer could also help in other ways.

The rate of transmission may be lower in summer as more people will be outdoors.

There could also be progress in treating the illness caused by the virus.

Drugs including those used to treat malaria and HIV are being tested, while researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.

Combined, all that should reduce the number infected and save lives.

But if the measures taken reduce cases too much, there is always the risk a second wave could hit as soon as you relax them.

If that happened next winter, it could cause real problems.

Getting the balance right is, it's fair to say, going to be very difficult.

"['Kevin Peachey', 'Personal Finance Reporter']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Key taxes are changing as a result of Budget announcements

Chancellor Rishi Sunak's first Budget came as attention is focused on coronavirus, but what does it mean for your financial health?

There were significant announcements on benefits, tax, and the wider economy.

A tax cut for millions

A tax break from the government regarding national insurance was promised in the Conservative manifesto.

The current threshold sees employees and the self-employed paying contributions once they earn £166 a week, equivalent to an annual salary of £8,632 a year. From April, you start paying when earning £9,500.

Image copyright Getty Images

That will mean 500,000 people will no longer have to pay this tax, according to independent economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).

Those still paying will save up to £85 a year on average. The chancellor said it would be just over £100 a year, but that calculation may not include the self-employed.

The IFS says 8% of the gains go to the poorest 20% of working households, so it is those on a decent income who may benefit the most. However, those working in a number of low-paying part-time jobs could see their take-home pay increase significantly.

Another tax to be cut is VAT on digital books, newspapers and magazines.

What happens if coronavirus hits my finances?

Many of the measures aimed to tackle the impact of coronavirus benefit small businesses and so protect some jobs. This has been coordinated with the interest rate cut announced by the Bank of England.

Specific personal finance changes include the chancellor saying all of those advised to self-isolate, even if they do not show symptoms, are to receive statutory sick pay if eligible.

UK employees have already started to get statutory sick pay from the first day off work, to help contain coronavirus. This is paid by the employer, but smaller businesses with fewer than 250 employees can reclaim the cost of paying sick pay for the 14 days of isolation.

Those who are not eligible for sick pay, particularly the self-employed, will be able to claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) from day one of ""illness"" rather than day eight.

ESA is paid to those who are too sick to work, provided they meet certain conditions. It is worth £73.10 a week, or £57.90 for the under-25s. The complexity of this benefit may mean this change is unlikely to affect a lot of people.

Councils will also have access to a hardship fund to help vulnerable people in their area, with money distributed through council tax discounts.

Changes on pensions tax for higher earners

The highly complicated way in which high earners are taxed is set to change. Basically, tax relief on pensions becomes less generous if annual income exceeds £150,000 a year. This has become a problem as the income cap includes the value of pensions earned, not just salary.

Some doctors have been refusing to work extra hours (and earning more) because they were being landed with much bigger tax bills.

They, and other high earners, are currently affected by this restriction once income goes over £110,000. The government has promised this may only kick in once annual income exceeds £200,000.

What about booze and fuel duties?

The duties on alcoholic drinks - beer, wine and cider - are all being frozen. So that means no extra tax on a pint or glass.

There has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade, and this will continue for at least another year.

About 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT.

Duty on cigarettes and cigars will go up by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation plus 2% until the end of this Parliament (usually five years). That is a 27p rise on a pack of 20 cigarettes. Hand-rolling tobacco duty will rise by RPI plus 6% in April.

What else has been announced?

Leaseholders will be able to access grants to safely remove unsafe cladding from flats. Some have told the BBC about how they could not sell owing to the issue.

The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the ""tampon tax"" - will be abolished from January. This was trailed by the Treasury at the weekend.

People can put a lot more into tax-free savings for children. The allowance for Junior Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) and Child Trust Funds will be increased from £4,368 to £9,000 in April. However, the typical amount saved is only about £1,000.

Owners of new motorhomes, who were facing a massive rise in vehicle excise duty, will now only face a much lower charge, following a campaign by the industry.

Those working from home, who can claim £4 a week off their income tax bill, will be able to claim £6 from April.

What we already knew

This April, the amount earned before paying 20% income tax will be frozen at £12,500. Also frozen is the £50,000 threshold at which people start to pay the higher 40% rate of income tax.

Practically, that means anyone who gets a pay rise in the coming year may be at risk of paying more than they expected in tax, as the extra wages mean they cross these thresholds.

If you are living in Scotland, you have different income tax rates from the rest of the UK. Changes were announced in the recent Scottish budget.

"['Justin Parkinson', 'Political Reporter', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson's Conservative Party has taken seats like Sedgefield which were once seemingly unwinnable

The Conservative Party and trade unions have a history of troubled relations. But one Tory MP thinks they can work together for the good of each other - and the country.

""Trade unions are a very good thing,"" says Robert Halfon.

They're not words one would expect from a self-described ""tribal"" Conservative MP who, growing up, saw his party's leadership engage in a year-long battle - which sometimes turned violent - against the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).

The miners' strike of 1984-5 was the bitterest industrial dispute in recent UK history. The NUM's eventual defeat, and the subsequent closure of the UK's deep coalmines meant that, for many trade unionists, Tories became hate figures.

Margaret Thatcher, prime minister at the time, branded striking miners' leaders part of the ""enemy within"".

'No gimmicks'

So how are relations between Tories and unions these days?

""The problem is there's always a Pavlov's dog reaction on both sides,"" says Mr Halfon. ""You mention Tories to trade unions and they say 'no way.' And, on the Tory side, mention unions and they just think of strikes and pickets. And trade unionism is much bigger than that.""

Mr Halfon, honorary president of the Conservatives' Union Blue group, wants his party to change its pitch to potential members. Like some unions, it should offer perks such as private healthcare and travel discounts, legal representation, and better access to loans and insurance, he argues.

""It can't be gimmicks,"" Mr Halfon, MP for Harlow, in Essex, says. ""People aren't going to join for a Nando's card. This is revolutionary for the Conservative Party and it would be a very, very different model of membership.

""Nowadays you can join the party by the internet, which is great. But what do you get for joining? Absolutely nothing, apart from letters asking for money and voting in a leadership contest or for a candidate.""

But there is one perk common to Conservative and Working Men's Clubs, he says.

""They're very good because you can actually get a pint of Guinness for a very decent price.""

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Robert Halfon says the Conservative Party should offer members union-style perks

At December's general election, Boris Johnson's party made incursions into areas where Labour - and unions - once dominated political life. The County Durham seats of Bishop Auckland and Sedgefield, formerly held by Tony Blair, were among those that turned blue.

Support for Brexit and Mr Johnson's promise to ""get it done"" is cited as a major cause. After his election win, the prime minister acknowledged that many lifelong Labour voters had ""lent"" the Conservatives their backing and vowed to repay them.

""I think the elections made a huge difference to our party,"" Mr Halfon says.

""There are more Tory MPs who have been trade union members than before. The party should make it its main mission to support trade unionism as a model.

""People have got to think imaginatively. We live in an atomised society and I want institutions that bring people together.""

In 1953, the Conservative Party had an estimated 2.8 million members. By last year the figure, as reported by then-chairman Brandon Lewis, was 180,000.

Trade unions, at their peak in the late 1970s, had around 12 million members. Since then several laws have come into force aimed at making industrial action harder to organise - most notably those passed under Mrs Thatcher's Conservative government.

'Constructive discussion'

""Both we and the unions have seen a decline, but the Conservative Party would give our right hands to have millions of members,"" says Mr Halfon.

Of the 48 unions comprising the Trades Union Congress (TUC), 12 are affiliated to Labour.

Mr Halfon, himself a member of the non-party-aligned Prospect union, suggests the Tory leadership can work with ""moderate"" and ""sensible"" trade unionists, without allowing legalising now banned practices like closed shops and secondary picketing.

He has even suggested that a union could become affiliated to the Conservative Party, but there is little sign of this happening soon.

""You have to repeat the message again and again and again before anything gets changed,"" Mr Halfon says.

He and Len McCluskey, general secretary of the huge Labour-backing Unite union and a vocal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn as party leader, had a ""constructive discussion"" a few years ago, he adds.

But what does the TUC - like most of its members officially politically neutral - think?

""I've met Robert Halfon on a number of occasions,"" says general secretary Frances O'Grady. ""He's somebody we may not agree with on many things, but he clearly sees a role for trade unions in doing the bread and butter of making sure that people get a fair deal at work.

""How others [in the Conservative Party] think, we have yet to find out.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51707579,BBC,Politics,TRUE

Trade negotiations tend not to begin with two sides in agreement - otherwise there would be nothing to negotiate.

So it's not surprising to see the UK and EU set out rather different positions before talks begin in earnest.

There are some broad similarities. The two sides agree they want a free-trade agreement, with no tariffs (border taxes on goods) or quotas (limits on the amount of goods). They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible.

But that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved.

Terms and conditions always apply - and there are several possible flashpoints.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.

Level playing field

First and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition, so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals.

These are known as level playing field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years.

Most importantly, its negotiating directives, adopted on 25 February 2020, say a future partnership must ""ensure the application"" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business.

The UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights in a way that would ""stand the test of time"".

But the government has now rejected this approach entirely. The political declaration it agreed with the EU last year did speak of level playing field commitments but, armed with a big majority in the House of Commons, it has toughened up its language.

In a document outlining the UK's approach to negotiations published on 27 February 2020, it said: ""we will not agree to any obligations for our laws to be aligned with the EU's"".

Instead, Boris Johnson has said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards.

""There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,"" he said.

He has also pointed out that there are areas such as maternity rights in which the UK has higher standards than the EU and that the UK spent far less money on state aid than Germany or France.

Canada-style deal?

The EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the one it has negotiated with Canada.

The UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference, but if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all.

The government says it will decide in June 2020 ""whether good progress has been possible on the least controversial areas of the negotiations"" (which it defines as things like financial services and data) and if not, it will start to focus on preparing for a new relationship without a formal free-trade deal.

Either way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January 2021.

His critics accuse him of recklessness, but the prime minister says he has ""no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper"".

Image copyright PA Media

Fisheries

The EU has said an agreement on fisheries must be concluded before any free-trade deal is finalised. That's because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe.

The UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion ""British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats"".

The EU sees things rather differently.

Its negotiating directives say a future deal should ""aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters"".

The EU wants to ""uphold"" existing access on both sides to fishing waters - language that has strengthened under pressure from EU countries with big fishing fleets.

The EU also seems prepared to link access to fishing waters to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market.

But the UK also rejects that. Michael Gove told Parliament: ""We will take back control of our waters, as an independent coastal state, and we will not link access to our waters to access to EU markets. Our fishing waters are our sovereign resource.""

Fishing is a tiny part of both sides' economies - in the UK it's well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel.

Alignment

When it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is a bit more flexible.

""We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,"" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said.

""What I am looking for is consistency.""

The UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so, but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently.

The more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge.

One late addition to the EU's negotiating document is the demand that the UK should stick close to EU rules on food safety and animal health, which is seen by some as a reference to whether the UK might import chlorine-washed chicken from the US in the future.

Services

Similar trade-offs will have to be made in the services sector. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU.

Instead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change.

But talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union.

Gibraltar

The EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU.

It doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain.

This is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines.

Mr Johnson has said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.

European Court of Justice

Gaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit.

Now, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free-trade agreement.

It wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they ""raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law"".

But the government's outline says it will not allow ""the EU's institutions, including the Court of Justice, to have any jurisdiction in the UK"".

The ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years.

But a future trade deal is a different matter.

Image copyright AFP

Other issues

Devising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy.

It's not just about trade, it's about internal security co-operation and access to databases too.

""Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,"" Michel Barnier said, ""obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full"".

The EU's mandate also says there should be ""automatic termination"" of law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The bottom line for the UK? The ECJ and the EU's legal order ""must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way"".

Timing

So there are some big divides to be bridged.

Both sides are accusing the other of moving the goalposts and backing away from commitments made in the non-binding political declaration.

Many observers expect a serious row and a possible breakdown in the talks sooner rather than later.

On the other hand, both the UK and the EU say they would settle for a free-trade agreement. The difficult part will be working out how to get there and how to implement it.

It is also worth recalling the government's own internal analysis from November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU.

There is a long way to go in a short period of time.

Who do you trust?

That's no small question. But it's a fundamental one when it comes to politics.

For democracy to work well, voters have to have at least a modicum of faith that when politicians are taking decisions they are doing it in our best interests, or at least they are doing what they perceive to be the right thing even if you believe they are wildly wrong.

There's little doubt that the agonies of the Brexit process saw trust being stretched to breaking point.

While in such an era of political controversy there has been huge concern, thousands of column inches and hours of discussion on the airwaves about the damage that's been done, the British public didn't just wake up one morning and decide that their politicians were a bunch of charlatans.

And there were plenty of reasons why voters had concerns about whether they could trust them long before a certain campaign group put a certain number on the side of a red bus.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The financial meltdown in September 2008 cast a long shadow

It seems a different age, but there were dramatic events in the previous decade that certainly undermined the relationship between the public and those in power.

And in a new documentary, The Decade of Distrust, to be aired on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday evening, we delve into the archive of 2000 to 2010.

We revisit the political controversies of the Iraq war, the jaw-dropping revelations of the MPs' expenses scandal, the estimate-busting increase in immigration, the horror of Harold Shipman's murders and, more than anything else, the financial crash, the moment when the foundations of the economy and the basis of our political assumptions simply fell away.

The programme takes us from Gordon Brown's living room in Fife and George Osborne's editor's office at the Evening Standard in London back in time.

It was almost eerie to talk to those two about how the crash unfolded and the impact it had on our faith in the political system.

Image caption Political leaders in the first decade of the 21st century faced rising mistrust

The former prime minister now believes the people lost trust not because his government made mistakes in handling the crisis, but because they didn't explain to the public what was happening.

He told me: 'We didn't communicate properly, and trust was lost because of that.

""I look back to Roosevelt who did Saturday night radio broadcasts, I kept thinking what is the medium to get our message across?

""People wanted gameshows. Social media was becoming big but we didn't really realise the power of it.

""So we didn't get our message across properly, we didn't explain it's a banking crisis, it was worldwide, we had an answer.""

George Osborne reflects that the combination of events in those years, the ""rabbit punches of the expenses scandal, and of the bailing out of the banks"" created a climate where people found it harder to trust the government, with consequences we are still living with today, although he jokes that the cartoons he publishes in the paper he edits now are far less rude than those in previous centuries.

British voters have always been a healthily sceptical bunch.

Politicians have never exactly been held up as paragons of virtue.

But it is hard for any political generation to restore the public's faith and trust once it has gone, and the first 10 years of this century set the scene for the turmoil in the UK we have just all lived through.

""I think that on trade issues,"" said the French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves le Drian, ""we are going to rip each other apart.""

The war of words about a potential trade agreement between the UK and the EU is heating up.

But that's to be expected.

And behind the scenes, a huge amount of work is going on to prepare for what could be a bruising few months.

""At the end of this year,"" said the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, in a speech in Brussels, ""we [will] recover our political and economic independence in full - why would we want to postpone it? That is the point of Brexit.""

So what do you need to think about when you're preparing for trade negotiations?

""What do you want? That's probably the first thing you have to be absolutely crystal clear on,"" says Emily Jones, who runs the global economic governance programme at the Blavatnik School, at Oxford University.

""There's a lot of trade-offs in doing a trade deal and it's really important to be clear about what your priorities are and how you rank them.""

Image copyright Getty Images

Fishing is a good example. It's a tiny part of the overall economy in the UK and the EU but both sides have already insisted they see it as a priority.

So what might either side be willing to concede in one sector to get what they want in another?

It's worth remembering most deals are about getting rid of barriers to trade and moving closer together - but this negotiation will be about moving further apart.

Landing zone

It's also important to know what the other side at the negotiating table wants to achieve.

To do that, you need to understand the politics they are grappling with and the legal and institutional constraints they face.

""It's important to think about what the final deal will look like,"" Ms Jones says, ""you have to define the landing zone.""

A deal has to be acceptable to both sides; otherwise - in the end - it will fail. This is the core of the UK's argument that the EU needs to see this as a negotiation between sovereign equals.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics

Realism

Of course, there will be more lurid headlines on trade in the coming months.

In the end though, after all the shouting, when both sides need a deal, there will need to be realism about what can be achieved.

""I fear we are not as ready as we would like to be,"" says Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, ""and the time constraint is very binding.""

""We are only going to get a limited number of things done and we should be realistic about that.""

Most trade experts believe whatever happens this year, negotiations will have to continue for some time to come.

""The difficult things are where regulations are concerned,"" Mr Winters says.

""So it's services, industrial regulations, food safety, chemicals and so on. It's quite straightforward to cut tariffs to zero; it's all the other stuff that takes time.""

Transparency

The temptation must be to push things through behind the scenes but recent history suggests too much secrecy in trade negotiations can prompt a hostile reaction.

In 2016, tens of thousands of Europeans marched against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a proposed free-trade agreement between the EU and the United States, which has now been abandoned.

""There was a huge backlash,"" says Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade law at the solicitors Gowling WLG. And lessons learned then about transparency should be taken on board now.

Image copyright Getty Images

""You may need to keep some of the details secret,"" she says, ""but you need to keep touching base with all your stakeholders - not only with business but with consumers and trades unions as well.""

Serious discussions about trade in the UK are confined mostly to expert gatherings or government meetings behind closed doors.

By comparison, the US has already held public consultations about a possible trade deal with the UK and the EU has published the detailed text of its draft negotiating mandate.

In London, there's certainly a sense of anticipation - and the government says it will set out its plans in more detail in written form.

""We've never done anything like this before,"" Mr Winters says. ""In a sense it's very exciting and along with excitement goes a degree of terror.""

National Conversation

And there are wider issues to consider.

How do trade deals fit in with other foreign policy goals such as security or with other domestic priorities such as reducing regional inequality or decarbonising the economy?

""We as a society need to have a national conversation about it in the UK,"" says Ms Jones.

""My deep concern at the minute is that we're going to be doing trade agreements that lock us in for the medium term or even the long term, without having thought through all the options.""

Time constraints

The post-Brexit transition period runs out at the end of this year, so time really is tight.

Leaving the single market and the customs union is the biggest economic change this country has made in at least 50 years.

But there's no doubt that change does produce opportunities.

In his speech in Brussels, Mr Frost said the UK would be able to be far more nimble than the EU in the future and take better advantage of new developments in the global economy.

""Britain will be able to experiment, correct mistakes and improve,"" he said. ""The EU is going find this much, much more difficult.""

There are no guarantees at the start of any negotiating process, though, about where it will eventually end up.

As a member of the European Union (EU), UK driving licences could be used to drive in countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) - that means EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

When the UK left the EU on 31 January it entered a transition period during which pretty much everything will stay the same until the end of the year. UK licences will still be valid for visiting EEA countries during transition.

What happens next will depend on negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.

There will be different arrangements in place for each country - specific advice for each country is available from the government.

Some countries will require drivers to have an International Driving Permit (IDP), especially for longer visits, which may be bought at Post Offices for £5.50. You may also need to carry your UK driving licence - some countries have stricter rules if you only have a paper licence. DVLA says more than three million people in Britain only have a paper licence, not a photocard.

There are two different types of IDP you might need in Europe, known as the 1949 and 1968 IDPs - the numbers refer to the dates of the conventions on road traffic that established them.

The 1949 permit covers any visits to Cyprus and Andorra and longer trips to Ireland, Spain, Iceland, and Malta.

The 1968 permit covers driving in all other EU countries that require IDPs, plus Norway and Switzerland

Image copyright Getty Images

Only France, Italy and Cyprus require drivers to have an IDP for a short visit.

The majority of countries, such as Germany and Spain, only need you to have an IDP once you have been driving in the country for a set period - three, six or 12 months.

And a few countries such as the Netherlands and Switzerland will not require an IDP at all.

It's also possible that the type of IDP you need to drive in countries outside Europe will change once the UK is no longer a member of the EU. You can find the full list of which IDPs you need worldwide on this page.

Another driving test?

IDPs apply only for visiting other countries. If you are a UK licence-holder living in another EU country, then you may need to exchange your UK licence for a licence issued by an EU country.

The government has issued specific advice for each country. In some countries, if you wait until after the end of the transition period, you may need to take another driving test.

EU and EEA licenses will continue to be accepted in the UK for visitors and residents.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.

Your UK insurance is still valid for visiting the EEA during the transition period.

It is possible that in 2021, after the transition period is due to end, you may be legally required to get a Green Card from your insurer to prove your car is covered if you are driving in Europe. This will depend on what is agreed in negotiations between the UK and the EU on the future relationship.

The Green Card is only proof of a minimum level of third-party cover - it will not necessarily match the level of cover that you pay for in the UK. You would have to check with your insurer to find out what level of cover you would get.

Image copyright Getty Images

The government recommends that you have a GB sticker on your car, even if you also have a GB symbol on your number plate.

You'll need to carry your V5C log book with you if you own the car. If it is a car you have hired or leased then you will need to get a VE103 form to show you have permission to take it out of the UK.

Perhaps most inconveniently, if you are involved in a road traffic accident in an EEA country after the end of the transition period, then you may need to make a claim against the responsible driver or their insurer in the country where the accident happened.

And that could involve bringing the claim in the local language.

Again, this will depend on the outcome of negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU.

A work by 17th century master Anthony Van Dyck is among three ""very high value"" paintings stolen from a University of Oxford art gallery.

A Soldier On Horseback by the Flemish artist, a leading court painter in England under King Charles I, dates from around 1616.

Two other works were stolen from Christ Church Picture Gallery, St Aldates, at about 23:00 GMT on Saturday.

Police said ""thorough investigation"" was under way to recover the paintings.

The burglars also made off with A Boy Drinking (c. 1580) by Annibale Carracci, and A Rocky Coast, With Soldiers Studying a Plan (late 1640s) by Salvator Rosa.

A Christ Church College spokesman said staff had initially alerted police to the theft of the ""important cultural artefacts"", and the gallery will be closed until further notice.

Det Ch Insp Jon Capps, from Thames Valley Police, said: ""The paintings which have been stolen are very high-value pieces dating back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

""The artwork has not yet been recovered but a thorough investigation is under way to find it and bring those responsible to justice.""

"['Mark Savage', 'Bbc Music Reporter']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Genesis P-Orridge - an icon of the avant garde

Genesis P-Orridge, founding member of cult experimental bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, has died.

The musician and artist, who had been battling leukaemia for two-and-a-half years, was 70.

With Throbbing Gristle, Genesis helped pioneer the genre of industrial music. In later life, they became a ""body evolutionist"", proposing a new gender that was beyond male and female.

The death was confirmed by Genesis's daughters, Genesse and Caresse.

In a statement, they said their father ""dropped he/r body early this morning, Saturday March 14th 2020"".

""S/he will be laid to rest with h/er other half, Jaqueline 'Lady Jaye' Breyer who left us in 2007, where they will be re-united.""

They concluded the post by thanking people for their ""love and support and for respecting our privacy as we are grieving"".

Born Neil Megson in Manchester, Genesis P-Orridge's career began in Hull in 1969 with the radical art outfit COUM Transmissions.

Alongside then-partner Cosey Fanni Tutti, the group played an abrasive brand of industrial rock, often combined with sexually-explicit live shows.

Their 1976 exhibition at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts, titled Prostitution, scandalised the art world, and prompted Conservative MP Nicholas Fairbairn to denounce the group as ""the wreckers of civilization"".

Shortly afterwards, Genesis and Tutti branched out to form Throbbing Gristle with Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson, releasing their debut album The Second Annual Report in 1977.

Crude, uncompromising and deliberately malicious, it was not an easy listen - based around multiple versions of the songs Slug Bait and Maggot Death, which detailed sadistic acts of violence and murder.

Only 785 copies were pressed, but the album was a key influence on the industrial movement, a more antagonistic cousin of punk.

""In terms of being shocking, punk was pretty tame in comparison,"" said Simon Reynolds, the author of Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.

""They were writing songs about serial killers and cutting themselves onstage.""

The band upped the dread on their second album, D.O.A, but discovered a more accessible side on 1979's 20 Jazz Funk Greats, recorded on a tape machine they had borrowed from Paul McCartney.

Two years later, Genesis formed another band, Psychic TV, who explored the singer's interest in the occult and fetishism; and scored a minor hit with Godstar, a tribute to late Rolling Stone guitarist Brian Jones.

The band's output was prolific - releasing more than 100 albums, and entering the Guinness Book of World Records after issuing 14 live records in the space of 18 months.

In the early 1990s, Genesis's house in Brighton was raided by Scotland Yard's Obscene Publications Squad after a Channel 4 programme alleged the musician was the leader of a Satanic cult.

Although no files were charged, the artist went into self-imposed exile in the US; where they met Jacqueline ""Lady Jaye"" Breyer, a dominatrix, nurse and soon to be muse.

Together they launched a ""Pandrogeny Project"" - surgically altering their bodies to resemble each other as closely as possible, becoming a single ""pandrogynous"" being named Breyer P-Orridge.

The couple also adopted genderless pronouns - s/he and he/r - explaining that they wanted to create a third gender.

""It's not male or female, not either/or — just complete,"" Genesis told Paper magazine last year. ""We thought it was important to remind people of that idea, and as artists, we figured the best way to do so was visually.""

In 1995, Genesis nearly lost their left arm while escaping a fire at the Los Angeles home of the producer Rick Rubin.

S/he was awarded $1.5m in damages, and used the money to bankroll experiments in photography, collage, sculpture and cosmetic surgery.

Having been a fringe artist for years, Genesis began to find h/er work embraced by the fine art world, including Tate Britain, which acquired several pieces.

In recent years, however, the musician's legacy was called into question by Throbbing Gristle bandmate Tutti, whose memoir revealed allegations of abusive and domineering behaviour.

The guitarist claimed that Genesis threw a concrete block at her head from a balcony, and ran at her with a knife after she attempted to end their relationship. Genesis always denied the accusations.

After Lady Jaye died of an acute heart arrhythmia in 2007, Genesis continued their Pandrogeny Project, and recording a final album with Psychic TV, Alienist, in 2016.

Genesis is survived by two daughters, Genesse and Caresse and first wife Paula P-Orridge, now known as Alaura O'Dell.

Coronavirus has badly damaged the entertainment industry - with films, concerts, TV shows and theatre performances postponed or cancelled.

Disney's Mulan became the latest major film release to be delayed, following Fast & Furious 9, A Quiet Place 2 and the James Bond film No Time To Die.

Broadway shows have shut down, while many TV shows have suspended filming.

Theme parks have also been affected - with Disneyland shutting down all of its attractions.

Here's a round-up of some of the latest entertainment events to announce delays or cancellations:

The live-action remake of Mulan was set to be one of the biggest film releases of the year.

Until Thursday evening, Disney appeared to be holding firm with the March release, and proceeded with a scaled-back premiere of the film in London.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mulan director Niki Caro and star Yifei Liu attended the film's London premiere on Thursday

But shortly after the cast posed for pictures on the red carpet, Disney announced the film was being delayed.

Director Niki Caro said: ""We are so excited to share this film with the world, but given the current ever-shifting circumstances we are all experiencing, unfortunately, we have to postpone the worldwide release of Mulan for now.""

Horror films The New Mutants and Antlers were also pushed back, but Disney said it was still aiming for a 2020 release date for all three films.

The release of The Secret Garden, which will star Colin Firth and Julie Walters, has been delayed from April to August.

The Tribeca Film Festival, which had been due to take place in New York in April, has been postponed.

Several US talk shows, which had already announced they would stop filming in front of live audience, have now been pulled from the schedules altogether.

Filming was suspended on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and Late Night With Seth Myers, all filmed in New York.

However, all three are planning to return to a normal taping schedule on 30 March, their respective networks said.

Several LA-based shows, such as Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Late Late Show with James Corden are continuing for now, but without studio audiences.

America's Got Talent stopped filming with live audiences, while some shows such as The Price Is Right suspended production for two weeks.

In addition to live talk shows, several dramas and comedies currently in production suspended filming, including NCIS, The Good Fight and Apple's The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.

But the BBC said it would be proceeding with Friday night's Sport Relief telecast in the UK, adding that it would have a live audience.

""We've been closely following the government advice as we've been planning this event,"" a BBC spokesman said.

""The Government isn't suggesting that events like Sport Relief shouldn't go ahead, but because people's health and safety is our absolutely priority we've been following their advice and doing everything possible to keep people safe.""

In the US, all Broadway theatres, which make up New York's largest tourist industry, announced closures until 12 April, the city's governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday.

That means high-profile shows such as Hamilton, Wicked, The Lion King, Moulin Rouge, The Book of Mormon, Aladdin, Frozen and Mean Girls will all close their doors for a month.

In London's West End, some theatres have reduced ticket prices to try to encourage people to continue seeing shows. The Menier Chocolate Factory is selling tickets to the play Indecent for £20.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was the latest art institution to announce it would close its doors.

""While we don't have any confirmed cases connected to the museum, we believe that we must do all that we can to ensure a safe and healthy environment for our community, which at this time calls for us to minimise gatherings while maintaining the cleanest environment possible,"" Met chief Daniel Weiss said in a statement.

The Louvre in Paris has also announced it will be closed from Friday ""until further notice"", having closed for three days earlier this month.

Disneyland announced it was closing its doors at its resorts in both Florida and Paris, while the Disney Cruise Line will suspend all new departures until the end of the month.

Several events were postponed, including LA Gay Pride, one of several LGBT parades which take place around the world every summer.

The Golden Raspberry Awards, also known as the Razzies, were called off, although the ""winners"" are still expected to be announced without a ceremony.

The Razzies, which recognise the worst films of the last year, were set to be handed out at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Los Angeles. (Cats is heavily nominated this year.)

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Live Nation suspended arena tours by artists including Post Malone until the end of March

In the music world, live concerts have also been largely postponed.

The world's two largest live-entertainment companies, AEG and Live Nation, along with several major agencies, have announced that they are suspending tours for the rest of March.

Tours affected include Billie Eilish, Cher, Kiss, Post Malone, Chris Stapleton and many others.

Rage Against The Machine also told fans their tour would be postponed, but said live shows planned for July and August still stood.

US singer Torres tweeted she'd lost any profit from her European tour booking emergency flights home for her band and crew.

However, most of the music shows affected so far are arena shows, and some events with smaller audiences are still scheduled to go ahead.

The Waterstones Children's Book Prize, scheduled for 26 March, will be delayed until the summer, the book chain announced.

Record Store Day is another event affected, with organisers announcing on Friday it had been put back from 18 April to 20 June.

,"Image caption Radcliffe is currently appearing in Endgame at London's Old Vic theatre

Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has revealed that remaining in the UK and having supportive parents helped him stay grounded after he became famous.

The actor was 11 when he won the title role in the Potter film series.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Radcliffe said his family helped him keep a sense of ""perspective"".

Yet he said he could understand why other child actors have had substance issues in the years following their youthful stardom.

""I think a huge problem for a lot of people is they get into a situation where they start doing something when they're 10,"" the 30-year-old told presenter Lauren Laverne.

""They are committed for several years, and they stop enjoying it.

""They are, by that point, the breadwinner for their family, so multiple people are reliant on them continuing to do this job and they feel pressured into it.

""If they don't enjoy it they go 'well, I will enjoy all the other things this life gives me, even if I hate the work'. So I think that's why you can see people going to drugs.

""You can also just see people go to drugs and drink because it's fun and they're available and it seems like a good idea, and there's nobody around you talking about the consequences or being honest about that.""

Image caption Radcliffe with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint in 2003

The actor praised his parents and his fellow Harry Potter actors, ""who were able to give me enough perspective on my life and help me at key moments"".

The main reason he has continued to work in the entertainment industry as an adult, he continued, was that he has always ""loved being on set"".

The actor has starred in several films and TV series since the Potter series ended after eight films in 2011.

His post-Potter films include Horns, Swiss Army Man, Now You See Me 2 and current UK release Escape from Pretoria.

Radcliffe also said that living and working in London had helped to ensure he had not been carried away by fame.

""I spend time in LA [Los Angeles] now and I feel like I'm going insane,"" he said.

""I don't know what it would be like to grow up in LA from the age of 10 and continue growing up there.

""I think the other thing that's hard about being famous when you're young is you haven't figured out who you are yet,"" he continued.

""If you are having a perception of your identity reflected back at you, where everyone else expects you to be a certain thing while you're still figuring out what you want to be, that can be really hard for people.

""But again, very fortunately, I knew that I liked being on set enough so that if everything else about it went away, the money and the fame, I would still like being on set, and I would like to still do that in some way.""

Radcliffe is currently appearing alongside Alan Cumming at London's Old Vic theatre in Endgame and Rough for Theatre II, both by Samuel Beckett.

Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 GMT and will be available on BBC Sounds.

The BBC's Sport Relief event had raised more than £40m for charitable causes by the end of its live TV show.

Gary Lineker, one of the hosts, said ""a chunk"" of the money would go to those affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

The fundraising marathon - which helps vulnerable people in the UK and around the world - went ahead in front of a live studio audience in Salford despite the health crisis.

The BBC said it would do ""everything possible to keep people safe"".

Match Of The Day presenter Lineker said the UK is living through ""unprecedented times"", stressing that ""never have the vulnerable"" been more at risk.

He hosted the fundraiser alongside Paddy McGuinness, Alex Scott, Emma Willis, Rylan Clark-Neal, Oti Mabuse, Maya Jama and Tom Allen.

Sport Relief had raised a total of £40,540,355 for charitable causes by the end of the live show.

Some of the money raised this year will go to projects dealing with challenges caused by the coronavirus.

A BBC spokesperson said ahead of the event that the organisers had been ""closely following the government advice"" and that people's health and safety was their ""priority"".

A performance from Rita Ora had been due to be followed by a choir made up of elderly singers and schoolchildren - but the older members did not take part as a precaution.

The evening's broadcast included a Line of Duty sketch that saw the BBC drama's regulars joined by Jason Isaacs and comedian Lee Mack.

There was also a parody of BBC drama Killing Eve, in which a host of famous Steves - among them snooker legend Steve Davis and Olympic rower Sir Steve Redgrave - fell foul of a blonde assassin.

The expedition - moved from Mongolia because of concerns about coronavirus - was the subject of a documentary broadcast earlier this week.

Meanwhile, Radio 2's Jo Whiley, Richie Anderson and the Reverend Kate Bottley raised more than £500,000 by completing three triathlons in three days.

Other challenges undertaken this year included a joint effort to pull a British Airways plane more than 100 metres at London's Heathrow Airport.

Flack, 40, had worked with both Sport Relief and Comic Relief.

McGuinness said: ""She will be greatly missed by us all.""

The last Sport Relief, held in March 2018, raised more than £38m for charitable causes.

"['Benita Barden', 'Bbc World Service']","Image copyright Conor Madden

When he was cast as Hamlet at age 24, Conor Madden thought his stage career was about to take off - but then an accident during a sword-fighting scene left him with serious injuries. No-one knew whether he would ever act again.

A piercing silence filled the theatre as Conor lay on the floor of the stage, listening to his surroundings. His body was frozen. He knew he was hurt.

Despite his youth, Conor had been playing the lead role in a modern production of Shakespeare's Hamlet - a role usually given to established actors a decade older than him. It was a huge honour.

The cast had already performed the play many times, but they had just moved to a new theatre in a different city.

Conor remembers the clang of a metal sword falling to the floor beside him, and a fellow actor cradling him and asking, ""Are you OK?""

The 800-strong audience remained still, assuming this was part of the play.

Then the silence was broken by the hurried footsteps of the company's artistic director walking on stage. He apologised to the audience and said the show must end. There was a round of applause, and the curtain fell.

Conor had always wanted to be an actor.

""Initially I didn't know why I wanted to do it. I just knew that I wanted to do it,"" he says.

Most of his relatives worked in manual professions such as building and painting. Conor was the first in the family to pursue a creative career.

At 15, he got his break in a play that toured Ireland. After that, he studied acting at Trinity College Dublin for three years, constantly developing his skills and gaining connections throughout the industry.

Image copyright Ste Murray Image caption Conor Madden in his most recent role, in John O'Donovan's Flights

And then he was offered the most prestigious role he could imagine - Hamlet.

""It was a great challenge. And I revelled in it and I really looked forward to it.

""There is this weight of history behind it, the fact that lots and lots of famous actors have played Hamlet throughout the years. It's made and broken careers, and broken actors,"" he says.

For five weeks Conor rehearsed and then performed in Dublin.

""Everything was perfect. I was having an amazing time. Audiences loved it, the rest of the cast loved it, I loved it - it was all great,"" he says.

They then moved to the Everyman Palace Theatre in Cork, the Irish Republic's second biggest city.

Although the same set footprint was used, the stage was slightly smaller. The actors had some time to get used to it, but the final technical rehearsal had to be cut short before the final scene, in which Hamlet is mortally wounded.

Given the success of their previous performances, the actors confidently made their way on stage, and everything went well until swords were drawn in the play's climactic final moments.

Conor and another actor found themselves standing closer to each other than usual - too close, it turned out. A rapier struck Conor just below the eye.

As he fell back ""it was like someone had hit slow motion on the video of my life,"" he says.

""On the way to the floor, the first thought I had was: 'Uh-oh, something's not right here.' The second thought I had was, 'We are totally, totally alone when we die.'""

The sword did not go through Conor's skull, but it fractured the orbital bone of his eye, and left him unable to move.

""I couldn't stand up. I couldn't talk. I couldn't really move. I just kept saying 'Ambulance!'""

Conor was immediately taken to hospital but it took some time for doctors to work out what was wrong. After three days he was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury.

At first he was under the impression that it was a short-term problem, and that he would be back on stage in about a week.

But over that first week, Conor's condition deteriorated. Soon he wasn't even able to feed himself, and his father had to care for him.

""I was 24, very fit, was used to doing everything for myself, and suddenly I'm kind of put in this position... My dad had to shower me, it was really unpleasant for a young man. It felt very emasculating,"" he says.

It took him seven months to re-learn how to walk and talk.

""I remember saying to one of the therapists, 'I was able to walk a month ago, and I'm in a wheelchair now - that means something to me.'

""It felt really bad. It felt really final, actually. It just felt like, 'Wow, this is my life.'""

But Conor's determination paid off. Although his brain injury had permanent effects on his speech and mobility, he was able to return to work within a year.

Back on the streets of Dublin, though, Conor experienced difficulties moving around. With his limited mobility - including balance and co-ordination problems and permanent double vision - he realised how crowded the city was, and how broken and uneven the footpaths were. Using public transport was extremely difficult.

So Conor and his wife moved back to his home town, Newmarket on Fergus in County Clare, and he began travelling back to Dublin for work.

But even acting didn't feel like it had before.

""There were lots of really stressful jobs, things I didn't enjoy doing, and I didn't know why I didn't enjoy doing them,"" he says.

""I wasn't able to explain to anybody what was going on, I didn't know what was going on. I spent three or four years just hoping everything would go back to normal and it didn't.""

Conor later found out that he was experiencing post-traumatic stress.

He experienced a loss of identity when he was injured, he says, and his abrupt return to work left him unable to process this.

Image copyright Ste Murray Image caption Conor Madden (right) with fellow actors on the set of Flights

""I didn't have time to grieve,"" he says.

""You grieve for who you were. I didn't fully realise the gravity of what happened. And it took three or four years to get what it meant.""

Nine years later, Conor is still coming to terms with his injury. It's been ""traumatic, literally and figuratively"", he says.

""There are things you do to accommodate it or to make yourself live with it, but there are no positives. I still grieve; I still miss who I was.""

It's his passion for acting that keeps him going.

""I love telling stories. I love communing with the audience and sharing this kind of bizarre quasi-spiritual experience with each other in a dark room in the middle of Dublin,"" he says.

""It's what I trained to do and it's what I want to do. So I do it.""

To accommodate his needs, the theatre company Conor works with allows him to take regular breaks and prints scripts for him in a larger font.

Conor has played the character of Hamlet since the accident, in a play called The Rehearsal, Playing the Dane. In this adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy - which he has taken on tour internationally - three actors audition for the role of Hamlet on stage. The decision is made in the interval.

Conor tells the audience about his accident, but he says they often have a hard time believing the story.

""None of the audience believes this is true. It's just like this is just an actor talking about how he can't do what he would like to do, rather than this is actually an actor who was stabbed in the face playing Hamlet,"" he says.

""I guess it is positive feedback but it's also incredibly hurtful, because it really did happen.""

If there is an upside to having an invisible disability, Conor says, it's that it has made him a more compassionate person.

""It's made me think a lot deeper and more carefully about other people. It's made me consider, 'People don't see my injury, so maybe I can't see theirs?'"" he says. ""I don't know what these people are going through.""

Veteran radio DJ Pete Mitchell, who championed a generation of indie bands, has died aged 61.

The former BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music broadcaster, originally from Crumpsall in Manchester, collapsed while walking near his home in Stockport on Thursday.

A statement from family friend Jo Houlcroft confirmed the father-of-two's death.

Across a 34-year career, Mitchell championed dozens of acts from his home city, as well as The Charlatans.

""Pete collapsed whilst out walking near his home in Stockport, the cause of his death is still unknown but he was not thought to be displaying any signs of illness,"" Ms Houlcroft said.

""He was knowledgeable and passionate about music of all genres, discovering and supporting many bands and was a huge part of the Manchester music scene.

""His wife Helen and two grown-up sons Adam and Sean are devastated by their loss.""

The Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess tweeted that Mitchell was ""one of the first DJs to play and champion The Charlatans"".

Mitchell, who began his career as a cricket commentator at Red Rose Radio in Lancashire, held posts at stations including Manchester's Piccadilly Radio, Radio X and Absolute Radio, and was one half of the duo Pete And Geoff, with Geoff Lloyd, on Virgin Radio.

IQ, his specialist weekend programme on Key 103 in the 1990s, became an important platform for rising acts such as Oasis, 808 State and Happy Mondays.

,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fox said he hoped the apology would be ""an opportunity... to celebrate diversity""

Actors union Equity has apologised to Laurence Fox for a tweet by one of its committees that called him ""a disgrace to our industry"".

""It was a mistake for Equity as an organisation to criticise him in this way,"" said the union in a statement.

Fox appeared as a panellist on Question Time in January, during which he called an audience member ""racist"" for calling him ""a white privileged male"".

His remarks were criticised by Equity's minority ethnic members committee.

Fox thanked Equity for their comments with a tweet, following a 19-day break from Twitter.

In a previous statement issued in January, Equity said its rules had been ""inadvertently broken"" and it had been ""a mistake to criticise a member of the profession without consultation with the union"".

In that statement, the organisation said ""racism is real"" and that it had ""a proud tradition of fighting racism and campaigning for equality and diversity in the entertainment industries"".

On Friday, Equity said it ""would like to make clear"" that nothing in its earlier statement ""was intended as a slur on [Fox's] character or views or to suggest that he should be denied the ability to work.""

Following the release of Equity's apology, the members of its minority ethnic members committee - since renamed the Race Equality Committee - said they had ""no choice but to resign"".

Fox had said on 24 February he was taking an ""extended break from social media"", having become ""more and more depressed"" after being shocked by ""some of the things said to me on these platforms"".

""I am fearing for my future and my ability to provide financially for my children. A thought that keeps has kept me awake most nights. People tell me it will blow over, but when you are in it, it doesn't feel like it will..."" he added at the time.

Equity's apology was welcomed on social media by Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan, columnist Toby Young and others.

Fox added he hoped it ""might [be] an opportunity for us to continue to celebrate diversity in all its forms. Including diversity of opinion.""

The annual festival was due to take place in Dundee over the late May bank holiday, with Dua Lipa and Harry Styles set to headline.

The decision follows advice from the Scottish government, which says events of more than 500 people should be cancelled from next week.

""It is important that we prioritise the health and safety of all those involved,"" Radio 1 said in a statement.

The festival was scheduled to take place in Camperdown Park on Friday 22 to Sunday 24 May 2020 - with 70,000 people expected to attend.

Camila Cabello, Calvin Harris, AJ Tracey and Biffy Clyro had been announced as performers.

But ""after careful consideration"" it's been decided the festival ""will not go ahead"".

""This decision has been made in conjunction with our event partners, in line with the advice from the Scottish government, and while we know fans looking forward to purchasing tickets will be disappointed, it is important that we prioritise the health and safety of all those involved,"" the statement said.

It would have been the second time Big Weekend took place in Dundee - Radio 1 was first in Camperdown Park in 2006.

The cancellation marks the first major British festival to be disrupted over coronavirus.

Two US festivals have been affected - with Coachella being pushed back until October, and South by Southwest being cancelled.

Dundee City Council leader John Alexander says cancelling Big Weekend is a ""sensible decision"".

""I am sure that people will understand why it has been made.

""Cancellations are being announced across sport and entertainment as authorities move to deal with a global situation.""

Disney has promised to continue making films and TV shows with ""an increased commitment"" to diversity in its output, according to its boss Bob Chapek.

""We want to represent our audience,"" he said at a meeting for the company's shareholders this week.

""We want to tell stories that our audience wants to hear, that reflects their lives.""

He was responding to a question about LGBT characters in their films and pride events at theme parks.

There will be a transgender character in a future Marvel film, and upcoming superhero movie The Eternals will introduce Marvel's first openly gay lead character to cinema screens.

Marvel Studios is owned by Disney.

Disney's ""family friendly"" criticism

There has been some criticism recently after Disney moved the Love, Simon spin-off series from the Disney+ streaming service to Hulu, which it also owns.

Called Love, Victor, the show is a based on the film and is about a teenage boy who comes out as gay at high school.

Variety reported that it wouldn't fit in with ""family-friendly"" shows on Disney+.

Hilary Duff recently appeared to suggest the Lizzie McGuire reboot is on hold for a similar reason.

A gay character was planned to appear in the revival of the Disney star's show.

Other shows on the streaming service do feature gay characters.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Disney boss Bob Chapek said the company won't stop pushing forward with more diversity

At the shareholder's meeting, Disney CEO Bob Chapek was asked a question by Catholic campaigner Caroline Farrow, who represents conservative group Citizen Go.

As part of her question, she asked: ""Is it perhaps time to reconsider what you can do to make Disney more family friendly, to make it safe for people around the world, not just one particular minority?""

She also claimed a petition which asks Disney not to hold gay pride events in its parks was signed by ""almost 700,000 people"".

A petition on the Citizen Go website entitled: ""Stop LGBT indoctrination at Disneyland"" has just over 400,000 signatures.

Disneyland Paris hosted a pride event last year and this year's celebration is currently scheduled for June.

New Disney-Pixar film Onward includes a reference to a lesbian couple - which led to it being banned in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

There have also been brief references to gay characters in other big Disney-owned franchises.

Avengers: Endgame co-director Joe Russo played the minor role of ""grieving man"" in the 2019 blockbuster.

And Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker features (spoiler) the first same-sex kiss in the franchise's history - described by a reviewer as ""a brief flash of two women kissing... among a crowd of characters"".

In January, Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige said there will be an openly transgender character ""in a movie that we're shooting right now.""

And Phastos, the character played by Bryan Lee Henry in The Eternals, was announced to be openly gay - with a husband and kids.

Haaz Sleiman, who plays Phastos' husband in the upcoming film, recently said the film features ""a beautiful, very moving kiss. Everyone cried on set.""

Katie Price should pay her ex-husband Alex Reid £25,000 in damages for misusing details about his sex life, a High Court judge has ruled.

Reid, 44, had sued Price, 41, alleging breach of confidence, misuse of private information and breach of contract.

Radio 1's Big Weekend is the first major British festival to be cancelled over coronavirus.

In the last week, two of America's biggest festivals have also been disrupted because of fears over the virus.

Coachella, set to be headlined by Travis Scott, Rage Against the Machine and Frank Ocean, has been pushed back to October instead of taking place in April, as originally planned.

The government is drawing up plans to ban all mass gatherings in the UK by next week.

Texas-based South by Southwest - an important festival for new artists from around the world looking for success in the US - has also been cancelled.

Tours are pretty much non-existent across Asia and Italy at the moment, with gatherings of more than 1,000 people being postponed in Switzerland, France and several major cities in Germany.

Glastonbury's still planning to celebrate its 50th birthday this year

Glastonbury festival organisers have told Radio 1 Newsbeat they're closely monitoring the situation but the festival is still going ahead.

The festival's head of event operations Adrian Coombs said they ""thoroughly plan"" each year's event, and ""put in place all necessary measures to protect the public and maximise safety"".

And when they added Kendrick Lamar, Dua Lipa, Lana Del Rey and more big names to its line-up, festival boss Emily Eavis said organisers had ""fingers firmly crossed"" the event would go ahead in June.

""As things stand we are still working hard to deliver our 50th anniversary festival in June and we are very proud of the bill that we have put together over the last year or so,"" she said.

""No one has a crystal ball to see exactly where we will all be 15 weeks from now, but we are keeping our fingers firmly crossed that it will be here at Worthy Farm for the greatest show on Earth!""

No other UK festivals have been cancelled

The latest update from Festival Republic, which puts on events including Reading and Leeds, Wireless, Download and Latitude, says none of its events will be affected.

There's a looming sense of uncertainty for people who've bought tickets - but cancellations could also have a big impact on the artists booked to perform at them.

""Everyone's going to be affected I think... everyone's losing money,"" Becky Hill tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.

The singer is due to appear at Coachella with Matoma and is currently supporting The Script on their European arena tour.

She says there are concerns of ""potential gigs being cancelled"" in places like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Brussels and Hamburg.

""The thing that's worrying is that insurance won't cover it.

""Festivals and shows are our bread and butter... it's the part of our job where you can potentially make some money.""

Becky stresses it's not just the artist who misses out on a day's work, it's a whole crew.

""If we lose shows that I've already booked a tour bus for and a band for and x, y and z... I lose that money.

""Us booking the band means they couldn't take another job where corona hasn't necessarily affected their work.""

'I hope fans know how awful this is'

The impact of cancelled shows ripples through to emerging talent, too.

London's King Nun had been planning their trip to SXSW for months with five ""incredibly important"" shows lined up as well as meetings with ""a bunch of industry people"" to try to boost their profile in America.

""That's unfortunately fallen apart now,"" says frontman Theo Polyzoides, who estimates the band are set to lose ""thousands"" in cancelled flights and accommodation.

""I hope music fans know how financially awful this is for the band they care about.

""I also hope it means they'll involve themselves in local music scenes more than they did before.""

"['Mark Savage', 'Bbc Music Reporter']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Niall Horan shot to fame as a member of One Direction 10 years ago

In a world filled with tortured musicians making music about anxiety and depression, Niall Horan is an outsider.

Affable and charming, he arrives for our interview whistling The Beatles' Get Back, wearing a sweater as comfortable as his demeanour.

Plonking himself down on a hotel bed with a breezy, ""how's it going?"", the Irish singer reclines into a conversation about his new album.

Titled Heartbreak Weather, it was inspired by his break-up from a girlfriend, thought to be actress Hailee Steinfeld - but the star was determined not to make it a downer.

""I was just like, 'Come on, have a laugh, you can't go around moping,"" says the 26-year-old. ""And it turned out to be the most fun I've ever had in the studio. A really fun year.

""And,"" he adds, ""I'm gonna have so much fun doing the shows.""

Optimism seems hard-baked into his outlook - but it could easily have gone the other way.

At the age of 16, Horan auditioned for X Factor, where he was absorbed into the boyband One Direction, becoming a household name almost overnight.

Between 2010 and 2016, they sold 50 million records and toured the world, pursued by devoted fans - some of whom would hack into hotel security cameras and write sexualised fiction about Horan and his bandmates.

Horan said his ""childhood was cut short"" by the experience, and there were times the lack of freedom became oppressive.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption One Direction were the most successful boyband of the 2010s

In 2016, the singer chastised a fan who'd taken a picture of him sleeping on a transatlantic flight. Last year, he told the Telegraph he developed ""a fear of going out cos you'd get stopped every five seconds"".

Things changed when the band went on hiatus. Horan took an extended break, ""mooching around"" on a back-packing tour of Asia (""a monkey stole my wallet,"" he recalls). By the time he returned, he was able to walk down the street unmolested.

But he refuses to holds a grudge against the fans that were his constant shadow for six years. In fact, he recognises the impulse to get close to your idols.

""It was like a circus,"" he recently said of his stint in 1D, but ""I understand why people hang out outside of hotels"".

These days, Horan has not just met his own musical heroes but he keeps them on speed-dial.

""Elton John's really supportive of my songwriting,"" he says. ""He's great [for] constructive criticism or just straight up criticism. You get actual feedback.

""And Don Henley [of The Eagles], I send him bits and pieces and he'll absolutely, no problem, tell me if there's something wrong with them.

""But that's what you need. I mean, there's a reason I'm asking for help - because I'm expecting a bad answer. And if Don Henley has an idea to make the song better I'm like, 'Well, you wrote Hotel California so I believe you.'""

Image copyright Syco / Columbia Records Image caption The star's debut album reached number one in the US, and number three in the UK

The sounds of his 70s soft-rock mentors reverberate through Horan's new album, most notably on the piano ballad Put A Little Love On Me.

Racier tracks like Small Talk and Nice To Meet Ya find the star showcasing a gruff and hitherto-unexplored baritone that, he admits, was borrowed from Elvis.

""Those songs came from a jam and that, in turn, invites sexier lyrics, for you to be a bit more vulgar,"" he says. ""So I was getting into character and having fun and it ended up sounding like Elvis.

""But I'm not sure I'll be breaking out the rhinestone catsuit just yet.""

The album is distinctly more uptempo than his folksy debut, Flicker (a US number one); a decision that was informed by two years on tour.

""I had a great time playing shows but the songs were quite chilled,"" he says.

""I was looking at faces in the crowd and you can see when people want to be sad - but then they also want to be jumping up and down, wrecking the place.

""I needed a bit more like jumping up and down and stuff.""

He started writing the songs at his home in LA towards the end of 2018 - not because he had a burning desire to get back in the studio, but because he was cooped up at home after having surgery for a sinus problem.

""I just started messing around, you know?

""I'd be watching something on TV and I'd be singing something or I'd pick up a guitar and have a little tinker around and before I knew, I was writing full songs.

""I was like, 'Jesus, I didn't plan on this but it's happening.'""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Niall Horan and Hailee Steinfeld were said to have dated for a year before breaking up in late 2018

The initial batch of songs were inspired by his break-up (he doesn't mention Steinfeld by name, and their relationship was never confirmed - but we're also instructed not to ask about her during the interview, so draw your own conclusions) but as the year progressed, the album took on a broader concept.

The idea was to ""correlate my feelings with different weather patterns,"" he explains, with the album reflecting ""all the different angles of a break-up"".

Everywhere captures that feeling of ""seeing your ex everywhere you go"", while Arms Of A Stranger is about the inevitable rebound relationship.

Nice To Meet Ya describes ""the egotistical part of the break-up where you want to go out and flirt and have a bit of a good time,"" but the album ends with a twist: ""I'm still in love with you"".

""So you start off with start a relationship, you wind your way through all these songs and that's the last thing you say,"" he says with a twinkle in his eye.

'Up for everything'

While promoting the album, Horan has deliberately cut loose from the po-faced ""serious musician"" image he projected on his first solo outing.

He announced the tracklisting via a fake weather forecast, dressed up as one half of The Proclaimers on James Corden's US chat show, and came up with the goofy storyline for his latest video, No Judgement.

The clip, directed by Drew Kirsch, features an elderly couple for whom personal boundaries are no longer an issue - whether that means eating mayonnaise by the spoonful in bed; or using the toilet while their partner is in the bath.

""I heard my granny talking about it: You get to a point in your relationship where nothing matters,"" explains Horan. ""Old people don't judge each other at all because they've lived enough life to not care.""

As if to prove it, he says that Barbara, the LA native who plays one-half of the video couple, didn't just embrace the scenarios he'd scripted, but suggested some of her own.

""She was like, 'By the way I can do a plank if you want,'"" he laughs. ""And she started planking in the middle of the garden.

""She was up for everything. She was having a great time.""

Another person who seems to lack proper boundaries is Horan's long-time friend Lewis Capaldi - with whom he's touring the US next month.

After the shows were announced, Capaldi claimed the duo would take to the stage ""bottomless,"" branding it ""the no-pants tour"".

""Is that what he said?"" Horan exclaims. ""I don't know what's wrong with him. I'll probably be wearing clothes.""

But while the friends have been plotting a joint tour for a long time, Horan says they'll be forgoing a party lifestyle on the road.

""I'm big on value for money - and there's nothing worse than going to a gig and looking at someone that's tired or bored,"" he says.

""I have to perform for like an hour and 40 minutes, so I can't [go partying] every night. I'll be in the gym every day and Lewis said he's doing the same, so it's gonna be the chilled out version of us.""

And if he takes care of himself, can he imagine playing stadiums in his 70s, like his mentors Elton John and Don Henley?

""I'd absolutely love to be there if the people will have me around,"" he says.

""That's what you want. You strive for legendary status and if you get it, you get it, and if you don't, well at least you tried.""

Niall Horan's album, Heartbreak Weather, is out now.

"['Valeria Perasso', 'Social Affairs Correspondent', 'Bbc World Service']","Image copyright HBO Image caption The Deuce looked at the rise of the adult film industry in 1970s New York - and there was a lot of simulated sex and nudity in the script

Alicia Rodis walks onto set in New York with a mission: to oversee the shooting of a very complex - and daring - group sex scene for a TV series on a major US network. She's there to make sure the director observes the intimacy boundaries set by each of the 30 actors taking part.

She keeps track of the conditions of their consent on a big spreadsheet, to make sure everyone is comfortable when the camera rolls.

In a theatre elsewhere in the city, Chelsea Pace choreographs an intimate scene performed by a couple.

""Here you don't 'grope', you make muscle-level contact with the front of your partner's body,"" she says, using non-sexual language to interpret the stage directions, as the two actors repeat a set of movements.

Welcome to the world of intimacy coordinators.

These women wouldn't have been doing this job just a few years ago. Now they are part of one of the fastest-growing professions across the entertainment industry.

Image copyright Dahlia Katz Image caption Alicia Rodis is HBO's intimacy coordinator. The American TV network now hires a specialist for every show involving nudity

As trained facilitators, they help performers and productions navigate sensitive scenes involving physical contact, from hugs and kisses to nudity or simulated sex.

Just weeks ago, the powerful US actors' union SAG-AFTRA issued a landmark document, regulating sex scenes through the hiring of these intimacy experts. It's part of a wider drive to stop sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry.

""This came off the back of the concern of our members for their safety,"" says SAG-AFTRA president, Gabrielle Carteris. ""Actors, and women in particular, spoke out to tell their stories. Not just about Weinstein, but many others,""

The former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, 67, was found guilty of two accounts of sexual assault in a New York trial last month.

Allegations against him helped spark the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. In the two years since, the demand for intimacy coordinators in Hollywood has soared.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Ex film producer Weinstein was found guilty of rape in watershed case

""We have stunt coordinators, choreograph fight scenes and really take care of people when physical violence is involved,"" says Alicia Rodis, who first trained as a fight choreographer.

""But then when it comes to intimacy and nudity, which is another high-risk situation, there was no consideration at all. It is shocking.""

Rodis is now a full-time intimacy coordinator and co-founder of Intimacy Directors International.

Industry experts estimate some 50 intimacy specialists are currently advising productions, mainly in the US and the UK, a tenfold increase over just a few years.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The portrayal of intimacy on screen has been re examined in post-#MeToo Hollywood

Power imbalance

Improvising intimate scenes after basic instructions from the director used to be norm, leaving actors to fend for themselves in establishing boundaries.

""We used to rely on actors actual lived experiences, we just had to hope that an actor's idea of 'passionately making out' would match the director's,"" says Pace, who also acts and co-founded research group Theatrical Intimacy Education in 2017.

Image copyright HBO Image caption Clark's role as queen Daenerys Targaryen initially required her to take her clothes off quite a lot

The power dynamics at play in the industry makes it hard for actors - particularly women - to speak up if they aren't happy.

""First rule of self-preservation is to say 'yes' to everything you get asked. That's really baked into actors' training,"" says Pace.

The issue has been simmering since long before the Weinstein scandal erupted, in October 2017.

Decades after filming Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris in 1972, Maria Schneider said she had felt ""humiliated"" and ""a little raped"" as the director surprised her with unscripted sexual contact. She was 19 at the time.

More recently, Emilia Clark has spoken about filming some explicit scenes on Game of Thrones, which she found ""terrifying"".

""I'm now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don't know what I'm meant to do, and I don't know what's expected of me, and I don't know what you want, and I don't know what I want,"" she said in an interview.

But things have started to change in post #MeToo Hollywood.

One of the turning points happened on the set of HBO series The Deuce, about the blossoming porn industry in 1970s New York. Emily Meade, who played a sex worker and porn star, spoke to bosses when she found some of her nude scenes overwhelming.

""I'm somebody who has played really sexualised characters my whole career. I did my first sex scene at 16. And there are many times I've felt uncomfortable, whether I've realized it in the moment or looking back retroactively,"" said Meade in an HBO interview.

In came Alicia Rodis, hired for the first time by a mainstream TV network to facilitate the simulation of sex in a scene.

Image copyright Paul Schiraldi / HBO Image caption Alicia Rodis with director Susana White on set of The Deuce

""I always say, 'Let's discuss what's on the page but also what's not on the page,' so there are no surprises when we get to set,"" she explains.

""I want to champion the director's vision but also make sure that we stay within the boundaries of the performers.""

HBO later announced that the network will contract intimacy coordinators on any show that involves nudity and other companies, like Netflix, Amazon and Apple+, followed suit.

Intimacy directors are now also often found on big theatre productions.

""You are a support system but also part of the creative process, to explore how intimacy as a storytelling tool fits in the story,"" says Yarit Dor, credited as the first intimacy director in London's West End.

""In theatre, it is a four-week process. In TV and film it has to be much quicker, so you work intensively with the actors before getting to the set,"" compares Dor.

New language

Amanda Blumenthal, an LA-based intimacy advisor on Showtime's highly sexualised series The Affair, says the job is ""part mediator, part counsellor, part choreographer"".

""A show will assume an actor will be OK doing nudity because he or she has done it before, which is not always the case,"" says Blumenthal, who runs Intimacy Professionals Association.

""It is an incredibly difficult situation to be in. I have found myself on set helping actors to enforce their boundaries.""

Over the past year, the growing community of intimacy experts have developed techniques and protocols for the job - from advising writers to discussing technical aspects of how to film simulated sex.

The new SAG-AFTRA guidelines cover the pre-production stage, with the intimacy coordinator meeting one-on-one with performers prior to the rehearsal, and making sure the costume department provides appropriate nudity garments, prosthetics and barriers to cover genitalia, such as silicone padding or hard fabrics.

During filming of an intimate scene, the coordinator will make sure the set is closed and the crew numbers are kept to a minimum. And they will help choreograph the physical interaction of the scene itself.

""A big part of our job is to make sure there is continued consent throughout the filming of the scene,"" says Blumenthal.

In the UK, Directors UK have worked to provide clear and practical guidance on directing nudity and simulated sex.

And Ita O'Brien, the BBC's first intimacy director and advisor to Netflix's Sex Education, has been developing a set of guidelines, collecting best practices in the industry. There is a need to establish boundaries, says O'Brien, ""including an agreed strategy to halt the action where necessary.""

These scenes need as much planning as a car chase or any other stunt, experts say.

""If there is kissing and maybe some heavy-petting, are we OK with having our breast touched? Having back, shoulders, bottom being touched? We make sure there is no genital contact or, if actors agree to have genital contact as part of the scene, that there's a barrier,"" explains Rodis.

Before, the role of looking after performers often fell on costume and makeup artists, who would hand out robes in between shots and glance at the monitor to make sure the camera was not revealing more than was agreed.

Now, intimacy coordinators are bringing a new element to the set - desexualised language to interpret the stage directions.

""It is not one actor groping another actor: it is one character groping another character, but the actors are making muscle-level contact,"" explains Pace.

Rather than ""caress your partner"", Pace says she would instruct an actor to ""make some skin-contact with the side of your partner's face"".

""It is not only more specific but also free from sexual connotations"", she says.

""We find that the scenes get cleaner. And I don't mean censored, just better thought-out"", agrees Rodis.

Image copyright Forever Tonight / Swetha Regunathan Image caption Even if the sex is simulated for the camera , the physical proximity between actors is real - and it may not always be comfortable

Structural change

Yet the new role of the intimacy supervisors met with some reluctance in the industry.

At first, says SAG's Carteris, directors and producers feared the shooting process might be slowed down.

There's also a financial concern, as hiring a specialist can remain off-budget for smaller productions.

""We are not the sex police. Sometimes directors think we are there to tell them 'no' to a moment of nudity they want to have. That's not what we do,"" says Pace.

""Once they work with an intimacy expert, many directors feel that having this extra person takes some of the weight off them, it's a safeguard,"" says Yarit Dor.

There is however a more radical industry shift that is needed - one that shakes that ""yes culture"" that stops actors, particularly women, to stand their grounds.

""This is about redistribution of power on the set. We need directors who want actors to have a say, and actors to know how to articulate what they need,"" Pace says.

Image copyright Marlayna Demond Image caption New generations of actors familiarised with intimacy coordinators may bring about change

The increasing number of trained intimacy choreographers, as well as intimacy-aware new generations of actors, may help this industry shift.

Last year, Intimacy Directors International had more than 70 applications for 10 places in their certification course, according to Reuters.

""The truth is there are not enough intimacy coordinators right now, and demand is only going to grow,"" says Carteris.

The pool of coordinators also needs to be more diverse, actors argue.

""Mostly women now, we also need more non-binary people and from different backgrounds,"" says Rodis.

""Sometimes it's just not appropriate to have a white intimacy coordinator, who may not know how to create a safe set for people of colour, and we need to be aware of this.""

Video game The Last Of Us is being turned into a TV series - and it's going to be made by the man responsible for Chernobyl.

Craig Mazin, who made HBO's nuclear hit, will work with Neil Druckmann - the PlayStation game's creator - to bring the series to television.

The game is a post-apocalyptic adventure set in a world where most of the population has been infected by a mind-controlling fungus that turns its hosts hostile and cannibalistic.

Craig describes The Last of Us as a ""breathtaking work of art"" and told The Hollywood Reporter adapting it for TV has been a dream of his for years.

Its main characters are bereaved father Joel and Ellie, a young girl he meets who may be the key to curing the infection. The pair form a bond as Joel escorts Ellie across the United States.

'I hope it will be like The Witcher'

Having Neil Druckmann involved in writing the TV series gives 27-year-old Mat Ombler hope the show will live up to the critically-acclaimed game.

""That is a rarity when it comes to video game adaptations,"" he says.

""It's normally done by someone who doesn't really have that much knowledge or experience of the game - and as a result, it completely misses.""

Mat says attempts to bring blockbuster games like Resident Evil and Assassins Creed to the big screen are two examples of these ""misses"" - but he believes there have been some good ones recently.

""I'm hoping this will follow in the footsteps of The Witcher and show that when these things stick true to their original source material, you've got something that can make really great TV.""

Image copyright Sony Playstation Image caption The video game's sequel, The Last of Us 2, is due for release in May this year

But 23-year-old Chanté Goodman hopes the TV show gives viewers more than a re-telling of what they've already seen on their PlayStation.

""I'd prefer to see something that's not in the games,"" she tells Newsbeat.

""I think it would be unfortunate to develop a story with just Joel and Ellie, just because the games have done such an incredible job with them.""

That being said, Chanté is really keen to see a scene from the game - where the lead characters meet a herd of giraffes who have made their home in a ruined US city - be recreated in the TV adaptation.

'The Walking Dead makes zombie shows difficult'

The Last of Us isn't about zombies in the traditional sense, but gamer Benjamin Last believes the show could fill the spot in TV schedules that The Walking Dead once held.

""It's difficult to be a zombie show in a world post-Walking Dead,"" the 29-year-old tells Newsbeat.

""And I think there's a real chance of this being that show - and offering something different.""

Ben says the game's biggest strength is the relationship it depicts between the two main characters - something he believes HBO and the show's creative team can translate to TV.

""I think they've got a strong footing with the people who made Chernobyl, which has the same atmosphere that I think The Last of Us should be portrayed in,"" he says.

""Also HBO are very good at making character-driven shows and it's really all about Joel and Ellie - that's what drives The Last of Us.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Game creator Neil Druckmann (left) will work with Craig Mazin to bring The Last of Us to TV screens

The Last of Us has millions of fans HBO will be hoping to please with the TV adaptation.

The game was first released in 2013 on the PlayStation 3 and later re-mastered for the PlayStation 4, selling more than 17 million copies across the two Sony consoles.

A sequel is due later this year.

There are currently no casting details for The Last Of Us but both Chanté and Mat hope that Troy Baker, who voiced Joel in the original game, will get to play him in the HBO adaptation.

Ellie Goulding says she was ""not warned"" about the pressures of fame when she started her career in 2009.

The pop star said her first few years in the spotlight were ""tough"" as she struggled with shyness while ""being thrust in front of cameras"".

""I thought that was just what my life was going to be, and what I'd signed up to,"" she said.

""It's only in the last four years I've realised that's not how it had to be. I wish there'd been a little more help.""

The star admitted there had been ""times when I felt really, really low,"" but added: ""I'm feeling good now.""

Addressing a panel on mental health at Annie Mac's AMP London conference, Goulding she had often faced situations where she felt compelled to perform against her better judgement.

""I remember being really poorly once,"" she said. ""My voice was gone and I was just generally having a hard time, having toured solidly for about five years.""

Knowing she was ""unable to deliver"" a live performance to her usual standard, she tried to withdraw from a live radio broadcast, only to be told: ""'We'll never work with you again... You either do this or you're blacklisted.'

""So then you're like, 'I'll have to do it, but it's at the risk of completely shutting down,'"" she said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption TV and radio presenter Maya Jama said she had regular breaks from social media to protect her mental health

She was joined in the discussion by Radio 1 presenter Maya Jama, who said she'd experienced a similarly aggressive work schedule at the start of her career.

""There's a mentality of no days off,"" she said. ""I didn't take a holiday for the first two-and-a-half or three years [of my career] because I was scared I was going to miss out on a job; and that could be my big break.

""Now I feel fortunate that I can take time off but there are probably people just starting out who are in the same state of mind.""

Intense scrutiny

However, both stars said the entertainment industry had become more attuned to people's mental health in the last four years.

Goulding was joined on stage by Ben Mortimer, co-president of her record label Polydor, who recalled the industry's attitude to young artists a decade ago.

""I remember going through an artist's schedule and we were like, 'There's a free day there, what shall we put in?'"" he confessed.

""It sounds terrible but we didn't know any different. We just thought we were doing our job.

""But you come to it now and you're like, 'There's a week free there. Great, Ellie's got a holiday'.""

Since becoming president of Polydor in 2016, Mortimer has introduced several mental health initiatives, and now works directly with artists to support them when issues like anxiety, depression and fatigue arise.

The panel discussion also covered the impact of social media on celebrities' mental health, with Jama calling services like Twitter and Instagram ""a blessing and a curse"".

""I wouldn't have half my jobs if it wasn't for social media,"" she said, ""but then everything you do is under a massive microscope. It's not natural to hear so many other people's opinions about yourself.""

The Radio 1 DJ, who faced criticism two years ago when an old tweet surfaced in which she mocked ""dark-skinned"" black women, said scrutiny could be ""intense sometimes, but it's part of life now"".

She added that Instagram gave her the chance to correct inaccurate media reports or combat sexism - as she did earlier this week when a tabloid paper ran a headline about her ""jiggling her boobs"".

""I can't let weird journalists that sit on their chairs and eat Hob Nobs writing [rubbish] stop me,"" said the broadcaster. ""You can call these things out.""

Goulding noted that it was impossible for celebrities to completely disengage from social media.

""If you're an artist and you're not on social media, you're essentially invisible.""

""It's become a really vital part of your career when you're in the public eye,"" agreed Annie Mac, who was moderating the discussion. ""The question is, when are you allowed to switch off?""

All of the panellists said they took regular breaks from their phones to escape the ""echo chamber of negative comments""; while Jama recommended muting certain offensive words that cropped up regularly in her replies.

Jordan Stephens from the rap duo Rizzle Kicks also proposed a ""national social media blackout month"", and suggested newly-signed musicians should be mentored by older acts who'd experienced the harsh glare of media attention.

Goulding, for her part, extolled the virtues of regular exercise and literature.

""Whenever I'm feeling a bit low and I think, 'Oh, I'll just go on Twitter and see what people are saying about me,' I sometimes watch a documentary or a silly film, ""she said, ""but mainly I read books"".

The Budget projects a revenue surplus of Rs 9,509.14 crore for FY21 while is seen at three per cent, well within the prescribed limit of state Fiscal Responsibility & Budget Management (FRBM) Act. As per the Revised Estimates (RE) for 2019-20, the state will have Rs 6,175 crore revenue surplus while the is estimated to be 3.4 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) which is within the permissible limit of FRBM target for

“The outlay is proposed to be financed mainly through revenue receipts of Rs 1.24 trillion and borrowing & other receipts worth Rs 25,700 crore. Total revenue receipts for 2020-21 include the state's own tax revenue of Rs 38,350 crore, own non-tax revenue of Rs 17,650 crore, state's share in central taxes for Rs 36,300 crore and grants from the Centre for Rs 32,000 crore”, Odisha's finance minister Niranjan Pujari said in his Budget speech.

The Budget claimed that the allocation in health sector has been hiked two-fold to Rs 7,700 crore within five years. Recognizing tertiary health care as a critical requirement for the state, it has been proposed to transform the government owned SCB Medical College into a state-of-the-art world class facility and into an AIIMS Plus integrated medical institution with 3000 beds. An investment of more than Rs 3,000 crore is proposed over the next two years. Besides, the Budget has earmarked Rs 562 crore to help establish new medical colleges.

A separate Nutrition Budget statement has been envisaged for 2020-21 with Rs 5,210 crore for nutrition specific and Rs 23,754 crore for nutrition sensitive schemes in the Budget.

Promising electricity for all, the Budget has allocated a sum of Rs 882 crore as state share under Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana or Saubhagya scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vudyutikaran Yojana (RGGUVY) and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). Besides, there is an outlay of Rs 200 crore under State Capital Region Improvement in Power System (SCRIPS) and Rs 150 crore for Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS).

Enthused by the roaring success of the first two editions of the showpiece 'Make in Odisha' conclave, the Budget has proposed Rs 70 crore for the third edition scheduled in November this year. The MSME (micro, small & medium enterprises) sector has got a boost with allocation ramped up to Rs 250 crore, 30 per cent higher than last year.

Keeping to its aim of a transformative aspiration for tourism, the Budget has more than doubled the allocation from Rs 194 crore to Rs 401 crore. Almost half of this envisaged outlay will be used for creation and management of world class tourist infrastructure. Likewise, Rs 80 crore has been proposed for Bay Area development in Shamuka beach.

['Press Trust Of India'],"Finance Minister on Sunday said the idea behind introducing second alternative tax slabs sans exemptions was to take the country towards “a simplified, exemption-free, and reduced rate of tax regime”.

There was, however, no time frame set by the government to remove all exemptions, she told reporters after an interactive session with trade representatives and intellectuals on the Union Budget.

“At the moment we only started a second alternative with some exemptions removed or some exemptions included, although the original intention was to remove all exemptions and give a clear simplified reduced rate of income tax,” the finance minister said.

The Budget has introduced more tax slabs and offers higher limits provided the taxpayer is ready to forego all the existing exemptions and deductions including home loan interest, other tax savings investments. “We have not made up our minds as yet (on the removal of all exemptions)... We are trying step by step, move forward and no particular timeline given,” she said.

Addressing a post-Budget press meet on February 1, Sitharaman had said the government intended to remove all I-T exemptions in the long run.

On Sunday, she said based on a simulation and assumption, 69 per cent of taxpayers would have benefitted and probably 11 per cent would have been “attracted” had the new tax regime been introduced last year.

When asked about the Supreme Court order on telecom companies’ payment of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues and the concerns expressed by some bankers, Sitharaman said it may not be proper for her to comment on the matter as there is a Ministry concerned looking into it. “The concerned ministry is looking into it. So, it may not be proper for me to comment on it,” the minister said.

To a query on allegations by the Telangana government that there was a decline in devolution of funds to states from the Centre, she said the allocation is followed as per the recommendations of the Finance commissions and it is not true that the centre is not cooperating with states.

‘FRBM not breached’



The finance minister said the Budget was prepared keeping the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) in mind even as she maintained she would be remembered for presenting the “longest prepared Budget” than for “longest speech” on it.

“So in a way all these (measures) and more have been done that the FRBM, as an Act, we have to keep in mind and also comply with it. So we have not really breached the FRBM. We have not gone outlandish on it. We have kept fiscal discipline, which is a USP for both the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and also for the Shri Narendra Modi government,” she said.

The Centre had earlier said it was committed to reducing fiscal deficit — the gap between total expenditure and revenue — to 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2020-21 and eliminate the primary deficit as per the FRBM Act.

The government has utilised ‘escape clause’ under the FRBM Act, which allows the Centre to breach its fiscal deficit target by 0.5 percentage points at times of severe stress in the economy, including periods of structural change and when growth falls sharply.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/no-timeline-to-remove-income-tax-exemptions-says-nirmala-sitharaman-120021600696_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,TRUE
['Press Trust Of India'],"The Union Budget was ""disappointing"" as it lacked a vision, though measures like relaxing the fiscal deficit target and simplifying income tax are positives, the PM's economic advisory council member Ashima Goyal has said.

Goyal, who is a part-time member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), also said that it was a ""surprise"" not to have a mention of the word 'slowdown' in the nearly three-hour long speech by Finance Minister

The budget document is a ""balancing act"" between fiscal stimulus to drive growth and the need to be responsible on spending, she said at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research here over the weekend.

""Overall it (Budget) was disappointing because they didn't bring out the vision as a first real budget of a new government. It had to give a vision,"" the eminent economist said.

India's GDP growth is expected to slip to a decadal low of 5 per cent this fiscal, pressured by domestic factors like drop in consumption, as well as global issues.

""Surprising thing is that coming at a time when everybody is disturbed about a slowdown, the word slowdown is not used at all in almost three-hour long speech. There was no discussion on how the Budget is going to attack slowdown,"" Goyal said.

She further said Sitharaman was in a ""catch-22"" situation from the word go in the Budget making process, wherein any action would have left someone unhappy.

However, the finance minister has achieved a ""balancing act"" through her moves, Goyal said.

She elaborated that by adopting the 'exit clause' under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, the government gave a stimulus to growth and yet affirmed commitment to rules against fiscal profligacy.

To drive the point further, she said a 0.5 percentage point relaxation in fiscal deficit target offered under the exit clause makes lot of resources available, considering that the overall size of the economy is nearly USD 3 trillion.

Goyal also welcomed the government's resolve not to adopt policies similar to the response following the 2008 financial crisis.

She said in 2008-09, the fiscal deficit had gone up by 4 percentage points and the interest rates were also taken to record lows to stimulate growth.

There is also an attempt by the government to direct expenditure more towards capital expenditure, which suggests that the quality of the fiscal deficit is better now.

The Budget also has other positives like the ones on taxation, where there is greater focus on trust and simplification, she said, welcoming the debated moves on exemptions.

The government's moves on frontloading expenditure to early part of the fiscal year will also help, she said.

The measures on helping smaller non-bank lenders will prop up the economy as liquidity is still an issue for lot of players in the system, she noted.

The government has been ""opportunistic"" on the transparency front, she said, adding that credibility has been added by stating the off-budget borrowings through entities like the Food Corporation of India.

On banks' reluctance to pass on RBI's rate cuts, she cited pressure from both the elevated small savings interest rates and also the dependence of a large population on interest income.

""We are not willing as an economy to move to a lower interest rate, lower inflation economy,"" she said.

On the resource mobilisation front, she acknowledged that people are getting ""cynical"" with the privatisation targets after a massive under-performance on this front in FY20, but seemed to suggest that work already undertaken, like in the case of Air India, will reap revenues.

Meanwhile, she also flagged implementation issues on the budgetary targets, suggesting that the revenue increase targets are very high.

['Indivjal Dhasmana'],"did not rule out tweaking provisions of the Budget to address concerns of the industry.

She also said her ministry is willing to take more steps beyond the Budget announcements to boost the economy.

“As and when tweaking will have to happen in the Budget or as and when more has to be done beyond the Budget, we are willing,” she said in her interaction with sector experts on Friday.

The also said that the ministry will come out with detailed rules on its direct tax resolution scheme in a couple of days. This will provide clarity to those who are keen to settle their tax disputes under the scheme.

Changes to the Budget are made when the Finance Bill comes up for discussion which will happen after Parliament reconvenes post the recess next month.

Industry sought clarity on taxes on real estate investment trusts (REITs), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs), dividend tax, employees stock options (ESOPs) and real estate, among others.

The amended direct tax resolution or Vivad Se Vishwas Bill is yet to be tabled in Parliament and then enacted. As such, the rules under the Bill would not be in the form of a notification, Sitharaman said.

She said the details will give a clear picture to what the notification will contain once the Bill is passed by Parliament.

“In a day or two, we will be coming out with a clear non-paper (on the scheme) because Parliament is yet to pass it,” she said.

She told consultants from Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers, among others, that they will have time to look at these and tell their clients what will come out. “You will get 30 days or three weeks before the Bill is passed,” the told the consultants.

Recently, the Cabinet okayed expanding the scope of the Bill called Vivad Se Vishwas to make it more attractive. The ambit will include litigation pending in arbitration forums and debt recovery tribunals (DRTs). The scheme will also include cases related to revision and small-value search disputes.

The Cabinet also sweetened the scheme by reducing the disputed amount by half for those assessees who got favourable orders, but the income tax department challenged those.

Sitharaman has already introduced the Bill in the Lok Sabha to resolve disputed tax cases, amounting to Rs 9.3 trillion, giving effect to the Budget announcement.

The scheme offers waiver of interest, penalty, and prosecution for settling tax disputes. It was earlier limited to cases pending before the commissioner (appeals), the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, high courts or the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2020. Now, a complete waiver of interest and penalty will be given if tax dues are paid by March 31. An additional 10 per cent of the disputed amount will have to be paid after that.

Therefore, the Budget is likely to allocate funds towards these flagship projects, since they are aimed at attaining full or part operational status before the next UP elections in 2022.

Meanwhile, the Adityanath government today held an all party meeting seeking the support of all the political parties in the smooth conduct of the two houses of the UP legislature viz. Vidhan Sabha (Lower House) and Vidhan Parishad (Upper House).

Besides, the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) are seen as the fulcrum around which the opposition will take the government to task, and indirectly target the Narendra Modi government at the Centre.

Meanwhile, it would be the first time when UP Governor Anandiben Patel will preside over the Annual Budget Session after taking over the gubernatorial post last year from her predecessor Ram Naik.

In the second Supplementary Budget for 2019-20 tabled in December 2019, the Adityanath government had allocated Rs 1,700 crore to the industries department for the various infrastructure projects. Rs 960 crore was given to the UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) for the prepayment of loan HUDCO loan sourced for Purvanchal Expressway.

['Avishek Rakshit'],"Following the hike in the National Calamity Contingency Duty (NCCD) announced in the Union Budget this year, market leader increased prices by 10-20 per cent across some of its brands in all of its markets.

A rise in NCCD escalates taxes on cigarettes. Manufacturers have the option to either pass it on the consumer or absorb it.

""Prices of a number of brands have been revised,"" an spokesperson said.

This is the first hike in cigarettes after the Budget.

Sources said while the American Club Cool Fresh Taste saw the minimum hike of 10 per cent, from Rs 200 to Rs 220 for a pack of 20 cigarettes, the price of Navy Cut Filter rose by about 16 per cent, at Rs 80 for a pack of 10 sticks. Flake Filter has become costlier by 14 per cent at Rs 80, while prices of Flake Special Filter, Flake Blue Special Filter and Wave Cool Mint rose by 20 per cent.

Other brands that suffered a price rise were Gold Flake Super Star and Duke Special Filter.

Incidentally, it is one of the steepest price upsurges took in the past 2-3 years. Last year, the firm increased the prices of Bristol, Capstan and Flake Excel by 7-14 per cent and also introduced hikes in some regional brands while in 2017, prices rose by 6-7 per cent across brands.

However, in 2016, the company took selective price increases across its cigarettes portfolio pass on the excise increase, making Classic and Gold Flake Kings brands more expensive by 13 per cent. In the year before prices went up by 12-21 per cent.

The hike this time exceeded the previously anticipated surge of 7-10 per cent which sector analysts were expecting after NCCD was revised.

Analysts reasoned that on a blended basis, there is likely to be an 11 per cent tax hike on the average as the dominant 64 mm (mini king size) has seen a sharper tax hike of 15 per cent while others like the king size and regular sizes have seen tax hike of 9-10 per cent.

According to Abneesh Roy, executive vice president of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities, a seven per cent hike would have led to a 3-4 per cent decline in volumes.

The previous projection, however, is likely to be revised now.

ITC, which commands the leadership position in the cigarettes space with a 3/4th market share, has been raising concerns over the stress on its cigarettes business prompted by taxation and illicit trade.

After its third quarter results, ITC said that while the company continues to augment its product portfolio, “extremely stringent regulations along with a punitive and discriminatory taxation regime on cigarettes in recent years have had numerous negative, albeit unintended repercussions”.

It said that such a course has resulted in decline in legal volumes in favour of lightly taxed and tax-evaded tobacco products. Moreover, the absence of mandatory pictorial warnings on illegally traded cigarettes in the country has also added to the stress on the legal cigarette industry.

ITC also raised concerns that there has been widespread availability of illegal cigarettes and other tobacco products of dubious quality and hygiene to consumers at extremely affordable prices.

After its results for the third quarter of the current fiscal year, ITC said that the performance during the quarter reflects the persistent weakness in the overall demand environment, especially in rural markets and wholesale channel, tight market liquidity conditions and the increasing salience of illicit trade especially at the premium end.

During the nine months ended December 31, 2019, ITC posted a 6.31 per cent rise in its income from cigarettes, at Rs 17,928.69 crore, while profit from cigarette sales rose by 7.59 per cent to Rs 12,188.58 crore.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/itc-is-first-to-hike-cigarette-prices-post-budget-makes-them-10-20-dearer-120021101540_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,TRUE

“We are sound in macroeconomics. Even though there are discussions on whether the economic growth has come down to 5 (per cent) or 6 (per cent) from 8 per cent, our base is as strong as it was when there was 8 per cent growth. If not, will foreign exchange reserves be at the current level? They are higher than ever. Similarly, foreign direct investment is the highest ever. If it (the government’s work) is being criticised with a good intend to improve performance, it is good. We will return to 8 per cent growth,” she said.

She said people who blamed Prime Minister for growth falling from 8 per cent to 5 per cent should consider that industries were coming to India like never before. “When international markets are fluctuating, and and the US-China trade war are impacting the markets, if one Budget has been able to maintain all the three markets at good levels, it is the government’s Budget,” she said.

She was referring to the performance of the equity, bond and currency markets since the Budget presentation on February 1. She said the government had responsibly used public funds, unlike the previous Congress-led governments that gave bank loans to “uncles and brothers-in-law” when the economy was slowing down in 2008-2010.

Foreign exchange earnings in tourism sector has grown from Rs 1.75 trillion to Rs 1.88 trillion between January and November 2019. Factoring in the encouraging FDI inflows and outbound Indian tourist splurge on foreign travel, tourism promotion deserved a higher allocation, the industry body felt.

“We had already brought to the notice of the Union finance ministry that Rs 9,000 crore is being spent by Indians traveling abroad on holidays because India is lacking infrastructure required for the tourism sector. More good hotels at iconic destinations and domestic tourist locations are not available within the country and do not have sufficient hotels. It was proposed to give incentives up to three-star category hotels to enable Indian hospitality sector to compete with neighbouring countries to make tourism a major foreign exchange earning source for the country,” said J K Mohanty, secretary, HAI and chairman (eastern region), Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO).

HAI welcomed the Budgetary announcement of developing five archaeological sites at Rakhigarhi in Haryana, Hastinapur in Uttar Pradesh, Sivasagar in Assam, Dholavira in Gujarat and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu, stating that iconic sites with on-site museums will definitely help the tourism sector. However, it lamented the omission of sites of historical and religious import in Odisha such as Sun Temple at Konark, Jagannath Temple at Puri and Dhauli, the seat of Buddhist peace pagoda on Bhubaneswar's periphery.

The that for several months remained in the comfort zone of the central bank has started inching up and crossed the 7 per cent mark during December 2019, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables.

Experts said the MPC members are going to have a tough time as slowing economy makes the case for reduction in repo rate, while rising inflation and higher fiscal deficit will require the central bank to either hike the rate or maintain a status quo.

The sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2019-20 will be announced at 1145 hours on Thursday.

['Somesh Jha'],"In the Union Budget, the government hasn’t included the (AGR) dues, which the Supreme Court has ordered telecom service providers to pay, in its revenues for 2019-20 and 2020-21.

While upholding the AGR definition of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), SC had in October 2019 asked telcos to pay up past dues estimated at Rs 1.47 trillion within three months. The industry plea, seeking a modification of the order to get more time for paying up the dues, is yet to be heard in the top court.

“The AGR dues have not been factored in by the government in its Union Budget as the matter is sub-judice,” said economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty on the sidelines of the post-Budget-Ficci event on Monday. He said the AGR dues have not been accounted for either in the current financial year or the next. “We want to be on the conservative side while budgeting our revenues,” he added.

In the latest Budget, the government has estimated a revenue of Rs 1.33 trillion from telecom services in 2020-21. This is around Rs 74,000 crore more than the Rs 58,989 crore it expects to earn in the present financial year.

The government hasn’t specified the avenues from which Rs 1.33 trillion can be realised in the telecom sector.

It is either an ambitious target or the government would look for alternative resources, said analysts.

Besides AGR dues, spectrum auction across bands, scheduled for this year, would yield revenues. However, the financially stressed telecom companies are unlikely to bid aggressively in the auction.

Even after the SC deadline for paying up the AGR dues expired on January 23, the DoT did not take any coercive action against the defaulters as their appeals seeking relaxation in payment timelines is pending in the apex court.

The figure of Rs 1.33 trillion under the telecom head in the Budget raised apprehensions among telecom operators that they may have to pay a substantial portion of the AGR dues — over 50 per cent of Rs 1.47 trillion — in the next fiscal year.

According to Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) estimates, telcos have to pay around Rs 16,000 to Rs 17,000 crore as licence fee and spectrum usage charge (SUC) this year.

Even after assuming that revenues will grow sharply due to increase in tariffs and redefinition of AGR, they say it cannot be more than Rs 30,000 crore for FY21. But with a moratorium of two years on payment of deferred spectrum for FY21, which is Rs 25,000 crore, this money will not be available. Also with negative response on 5G, COAI expects the government to get Rs 25,000 crore upfront for fresh spectrum auction next year.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-2020-has-not-accounted-for-telcos-agr-dues-dea-secretary-120020301781_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,TRUE

They indicated that spectrum auction component may have been included in the receipts although the same could not be confirmed.

"['Shreya Jai', 'Amritha Pillay']","The proposal for smart prepaid metering across the country in three years, announced in the Union Budget last week, has been hailed by the power industry. But the initiative is not new. The power ministry has been planning it for the past two years, but with limited success. At the same time, many hurdles await the ambitious plan.

In her Budget speech on February 1, Nirmala Sitharaman said, “The ministry intends to promote smart metering. I urge all states and Union territories to replace conventional energy meters with prepaid smart meters in the next three years,” she said on Saturday.

Two years back, R K Singh, Union Minister for Power, said his ministry was planning to convert all meters in the country to smart prepaid meters. In an interview to Business Standard in 2018, Singh had said he would mandate state-owned power distribution companies (discoms) to switch to smart prepaid meters.

“Smart, because we are aiming at ‘time of the day’ tariff. Prepaid, because it improves bill collection and efficiency. It is pro-poor as well. Consumers can charge as many times as they wish. They will not face disconnection. It is good for discoms as they will get payment in advance,” he had said then.

Since then, 400,000 smart meters have been installed to date in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh. These were by Energy Efficiency Services, which is mandated for smart meters tendering to private companies. Close to 5 million were tendered in the first round.

Responding to the announcement in the Budget, the Indian Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers Association (IEEMA) said this is a positive step and the industry will fully cooperate with the government in meeting the target.

“Installing smart prepaid meters will improve the cash flows and revenue of discoms. Going by the government’s commitment to promote Make In India, it should also ensure indigenous meter makers are preferred over imported ones. With smart prepaid meters come data and cybersecurity risks. Hence, indigenous products should be given priority,” said Sunil Mishra, director general, IEEMA.

Despite the ambitious target, there is, however, no budgetary allocation or grant to smart metering in the Union Budget.

Praveer Sinha, chief executive officer and managing director for Tata Power, called smart metering push a ‘knee-jerk reaction’. “The government needs to first address distribution reforms. Smart meters on their own will not give much benefit,” said Sinha. He further added, once other distribution-related technologies are in place, smart meters will bring in great value.

Several industry players also highlighted that the investment needed under this ambitious plan would come from the private sector and hence, there needs to be a comprehensive policy. “The plan would need close to ~1-1.5 trillion of investment and five-seven years for implementation. There is no guiding policy yet on smart meters,” said an executive of a leading meter company.

He said a common policy should be enforced for all states with rules on payment security, data security, operation and maintenance. “To start with, all state and state electricity regulatory boards should be on board and agree to a unified policy,” he said.

A smart prepaid meter has a modem (communication device) and a remote switch by which demand, supply, and billing can be monitored and controlled remotely. The data from the meter is collected in a cloud server. This reduces energy theft, improves billing and bill collection. It also helps discoms collect the data of consumer demand patterns, which, in turn, can be used to plan supply.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/power-industry-hails-proposal-for-smart-prepaid-metering-across-the-country-120020301438_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,TRUE

An evaluation of 13,000 using the CRISIL Quantix database shows that working capital comprises over half of their need for debt.

In this context, the push given to the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform — the institutional mechanism that facilitates financing of MSMEs’ receivables — is a positive, too.

['Press Trust Of India'],"The new lower rates offered in the Budget 2020-21 will leave more cash in the hands of those who do not wish to make compulsory investments to save tax, said Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey.

In an interview with PTI, he said the Budget gives an option to individuals to migrate to a new regime by foregoing their existing exemptions and deductions for a lower tax rate.

""We are not saying which one is beneficial, which one is not beneficial. We have provided an option. We have not put restrictions on anyone. This proposal can only benefit somebody and not harm anybody,"" he said. ""So, in this whole proposal, not a single person will be loser.""



He said taxpayers have an option to stay with the current regime of getting a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 and investing Rs 1.5 lakh in saving schemes and pay 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 30 per cent tax depending on income levels.

Alternatively, they can migrate to the new regime and pay lower tax rates without having to invest in any instrument to claim exemption, he said.

In the new regime, 5 per cent tax is levied on an annual income between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 per cent. The tax rate rises to 10 per cent, 15, per cent, 20 per cent and 25 per cent for every Rs 2.5 lakh addition. A 30 per cent tax is charged for income over Rs 15 lakh.

""Because the proposal is that we will continue the old scheme and if you find the new scheme attractive, you come or else you don't come. Therefore, there is no scope of confusion or worry,"" he said.

Pandey said the taxpayer will have to choose between old and the new regime at the time of filing return for the next financial year, sometime in July 2021.

""When you file I-T return, there will be a choice. If you say choice 1 then the return form in the new system will open and most of your application will be pre-filled. Then, you make appropriate changes and file I-T (return). If you choose the old system, then only that form will open. It is easier to pre-fill the form under new tax structures,"" he said.

He said data show that out of the 5.8 crore individuals who filed returns in the financial year 2018-19, 90 per cent claimed tax deductions of less than Rs 2 lakh, including deductions under Section 80C of the Act (for provident fund, PPF, life insurance premium), Section 80D (mediclaim insurance), Section 80CCD(1B) (additional deduction for National Pension Scheme), deduction for housing loan interest and standard deduction.

""I am not saying it (new scheme) will benefit everyone. It might benefit 30-40 per cent people. But, even if it is benefiting 30 per cent people then also it is a big thing,"" he said. ""We are giving option to those people who are unable to avail exemptions or deductions. Who are these people -- somebody who has just joined job market, someone who has not decided to buy a house, he does not know how much will be savings, he might be putting little money in PF (provident fund) and insurance. He may find that depending on his income, this new scheme is better.""



Similarly, for senior citizens living on a pension and who do not have to buy a house or put money in PF, the new regime would be beneficial, he said.

The new tax regime is also beneficial for small businessmen and shopkeepers who do not get the benefit of LTC or HRA.

""It is not that our objective was to provide benefit to each and every section of the taxpayer. We have provided option and that should be fine,"" he said adding the new tax rates would lead to a Rs 40,000 crore dent in government revenues in the next financial year.

Individuals having an annual salary income of over Rs 13 lakh and availing deductions of up to Rs 2 lakh will save on their tax outgo if they opt for the new tax regime proposed in the Budget, government sources said on Sunday.

For those earning a salary of Rs 12 lakh and less and availing deductions of up to Rs 2 lakh, the old tax system will be beneficial as the tax outgo will be less compared to the proposed new structure.

While individuals with an annual salary income of Rs 13 lakh and above will pay Rs 1.43 lakh tax under the proposed tax structure; in the old regime, they would have paid a tax of Rs 1.48 lakh, thereby saving Rs 5,200, a source said.

On a salary of Rs 14 lakh a year, savings would be Rs 10,400; and for those with an income of Rs 15 lakh and above, savings would be Rs 15,600, provided the deductions claimed are up to Rs 2 lakh.

In the case of non-salary earners, who do not get a standard deduction of Rs 50,000, the new tax structure is beneficial for those earning Rs 9.5 lakh annually and availing deductions up to Rs 1.5 lakh.

There was no relief for existing who are stuck in stalled projects and are paying both rent and EMI on their home loans, said Abhay Upadhyay, president of Forum for People's Collective Efforts (FPCE), earlier known as Fight For RERA.

""Real estate sector is yet to reach anywhere near its past high despite all tax sops provided in previous year's Budget. This is partly because tax sops have failed to infuse confidence in the sector and also because many of the tax benefits provided remains on paper only,"" he said.

There was expectations that the Budget would separately provide deduction for principal repayment on home loan, which currently is part of Rs 1.5 lakh allowed under Section 80C, Upadhyay said.

""To infuse confidence in the sector, it was also expected that some tax relief would be provided to those of delayed projects who are paying both EMI and rent. Unfortunately, no such concessions were announced in the which may further delay much needed recovery in the sector,"" he said.

Real estate developers' apex bodies CREDAI and Naredco have also expressed disappointment over the Budget as their demand of one-time restructuring of builders' loan was not met.

However, many realty firms welcomed the government's decision to extend tax incentives provided for increasing demand and supply for affordable housing segment.

""Notable developments in infrastructure, rural logistics, education and healthcare sectors will create opportunities in real estate space. The policy on data centers was a key highlight and will make it a sunrise sector in India.

Among developers, Supertech Chairman R K Arora said the government's decision to extend additional Rs 1.5 lakh deduction for interest paid on affordable housing loan to March 2021 is good for the sector.

Omaxe CEO Mohit Goel said: ""Liquidity and availability of finance is the biggest issue confronting the real sector today.

['Kanishka Gupta'],"The Union has introduced a new personal regime, in an attempt to bring down the tax burden for individual tax payers. However, the changes don’t seem to be in favour of Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who aren’t paying taxes to date.

Finance Minister in her recent Budget speech on February 1, proposed to tax Non-resident Indians (NRIs) who do not pay taxes in any foreign country.

Yes, this statement made NRIs anxious. Especially those working in the Gulf region where countries don't tax their income.

So, finance minister clarified that only Indian income of NRIs is proposed to be taxed under the new provision, and later Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) also put out a clarification saying that ""the new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries"".

Well, if you’re thinking, what made the ministry to come up with such a change? The ministry said it was an anti-abuse provision amid growing instances of NRIs shifting their stay in low or no-tax jurisdiction to avoid tax payment in India.

Here’s what Sitharaman said in a press briefing on Sunday, “An living in another country earns money there, which is not taxed there at all, but has some earnings through something in India and does not pay tax here either because he does not live here. What we are saying is this: for the income generated in India, pay a tax. If you have a property here that generates rental income, but because you live there, you carry this income there and pay tax neither there nor here.”

“Have I got even a sovereign right to take that into my consideration or not? I am not taxing what you earn in Dubai,” she added.

Well, in view of this the CBDT chairperson Pramod Chandra Mody said that the move is ""essentially an anti-abuse provision"". ""Some study showed that people are trying to stay in multiple countries for a period lesser than that would make them a resident,"" he said.

And upon asking if these people are doing so to avoid paying taxes, he said it ""appears"" that tax evasion could be the reason.

""Now, in such cases of Indian citizens who are resorting to this system we are putting a provision that if they are not resident of any tax jurisdiction then they will be treated to be a deemed resident of this country."" ""And by virtue of that, their taxable income or to say their entire global income, will be taxed here,"" Mody said.

This means an NRI, who is not a resident of any country, will now be deemed an Indian resident and their income will be taxed here.

Mody said India now has multilateral tax treaties with other countries where ""we continuously exchange information and hence getting information on such people will not be that difficult"".

What’s more, tightening the residency provisions, the Union has also reduce the period of stay in India from 182 days to...

,"India's new budget is unlikely to drag Asia's third- biggest economy out of its worst slowdown in more than a decade as the government has proposed only moderate spending increases and small cuts in personal taxes, economists said on Sunday.

They said there was a risk the government might miss its target for 2020-21 as it was dependent on raising almost $30 billion from the sale of stakes in state-run firms and financial institutions to meet ambitious revenue goals.

In its budget for the year starting in April unveiled on Saturday, the government relaxed its target so it could spend an nearly $15 billion more, mainly on infrastructure and farming, while pushing ahead with privatisations.

Economists and industry leaders said the budget proposals would provide some support to growth over the longer term but were insufficient to give it an immediate boost.

India's economy is forecast to grow 5% in the year ending in March, its weakest pace in 11 years, ratcheting up the pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is already facing backlash over a socially divisive citizenship law.

""We see the budget as largely neutral for growth and inflation,"" said Nomura economist Sonal Varma, adding that the financial sector's problems could further delay any recovery. The government has proposed increasing spending to boost consumer demand and investment but it could not go far enough because a slowdown in revenue receipts tied its hands, economists said.

Rating agency Moody's Investor Service said the budget highlighted the fiscal challenges from slower real and nominal growth, which may continue longer than the government expects.

Nomura said annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP)most likely slipped to 4.3% in the last three months of 2019, after dropping to 4.5% the previous quarter, its slowest in more than six years.

Economists said India risked missing its budget deficit target of 3.5% of GDP in 2020-21 as the government's revenue growth target of nearly 10% depends on raising almost 2.1 trillion rupees ($30 billion) from privatisations.

Investors and consumers were also disappointed by the budget as no new incentives were offered for the beleaguered financial sector and housing market while it wasn't clear whether proposed changes to individual taxes would result in net gains.

""The tax cuts won't translate into much benefit for taxpayers,"" said Amit Maheshwari, Partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, a tax consultancy, adding that they could discourage saving and help push market interest rates higher.

SHARES SLIDE

Indian shares slid to their lowest in more than three month in a special trading session on Saturday after the budget was released, dented by what analysts said was a lack of sufficient stimulus measures.

The NSE Nifty 50 index <.NSEI> closed 2.5% lower while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex <.BSESN> fell 2.4%.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Finance minister said investors would soon appreciate the steps taken to boost growth as she had tried to balance fiscal discipline with additional spending, while giving concessions to taxpayers.

The government expects growth to pick up to 6% to 6.5% in 2020-21, helping India move towards its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025 from nearly $2.9 trillion now.

Many taxpayers lamented on social media that the budget was largely ""corporate-friendly"" as it exempted companies from paying tax on dividends, on top of a September cut in corporate tax rates to 22% from over 30% for existing companies.

Receivers of dividends will now be taxed instead, increasing the burden on high-income taxpayers. Sitharaman said the government would issue clarifications on tax cuts soon and may infuse more funds into state-run banks, if needed.

Analysts also said the government's increased dependence on borrowing could crowd out private investments and put upward pressure on government bond yields, offsetting gains from recent monetary policy easing.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut its benchmark repo rate by 135 basis points since last year but debt-ridden banks have not fully passed on the benefits to borrowers.

The RBI's monetary policy committee will next meet on Feb. 6 and the majority of economists expect it to leave rates unchanged following after recent spike in retail inflation, while signalling scope for easing in the future.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-stimulus-unlikely-to-revive-india-s-growth-from-slowdown-experts-120020300087_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,TRUE
['Kaushik Mukerjee'],"Direct taxes

The Union Budget 2020-21 is woven around the themes of Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring Society, together with better governance and growth of the financial sector for betterment of ease of living. The tax proposals are aimed to “stimulate growth, simplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance and reduce litigation”.

Proposals to stimulate growth



Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT)

DDT will be abolished and dividend will henceforth be taxed in shareholders’ hands under the classical system. Indian companies will not pay tax on dividends from domestic companies to the extent of onward distribution of such dividends within a specified period. Mutual funds’ dividends will also be similarly taxed.

The biggest beneficiary of this will be the corporate sector (domestic and foreign) and lower-income non-corporates. Higher-income groups will pay more tax (Table 1). Foreign investors can avail of beneficial tax treaty rates and foreign tax credit (FTC) in their home countries. This measure, coupled with beneficial low corporate tax rates, should enhance capital inflows for industrial development. Reducing the dividend tax for upper tax slab individuals to the DDT level can be considered before enactment. A disparity still remains for domestic companies earning foreign dividends, which needs to be addressed.

Startups

The tax holiday for has been enlarged. with turnover of up to Rs 100 crore (earlier Rs 25 crore) will be eligible and can avail the three-year benefit within the first 10 years (earlier seven years). Startup employees/promoters will not pay tax on stock plan benefits until the earlier of five years from exercise, exit or disposal of shares.

These make the tax benefits more realistic for and should encourage entrepreneurship, especially in the field of technology, contributing to ease of living. Considering the low success rate of startups, a limited concessional capital gains tax can be introduced for exits.

Corporate tax rate

The beneficial tax rate (15 per cent++) introduced earlier in this fiscal year for new manufacturing companies wasn’t explicitly applicable to power generating companies. The benefit is now extended. Going by the nature of the industry, transmission companies can also be granted the benefit.

Co-operative societies: The other beneficial tax rate (22 per cent++) applicable to corporates will apply to co-operative societies also.

These extensions should benefit the Government’s thrust on infrastructure development and help rural development.

Affordable housing: The tax-holiday for developers will now be extended to projects approved upto March 31, 2021. Home-buyers will also get benefit of deduction (of up to Rs 150,000) for loans sanctioned up to March 31, 2021.

Although beneficial, the extension could be for a longer term, to help long-term planning. Considering the state of the real estate sector, removal of notional tax on unsold stock would be further welcomed.

Financial sector: Merged banks will now be allowed to carry forward the unabsorbed tax loss of merging banks. This will help create substantial tax savings for merged banks, which can be pumped into the economy.

Foreign currency borrowing: The sunset clause has been extended up to July 1, 2023 for the 5 per cent TDS rate on interest on foreign currency borrowings, masala bonds, and certain bonds to FIIs, QFIs, and so on.

Simplify tax structure

Personal income tax

An elective provision is introduced with beneficial tax rates for lower-income individuals/HUFs who opt for simpler tax compliance. Such persons cannot avail of deductions/exemptions but will pay tax at lower slab rates (Table 3). The option is to be exercised before filing the tax return, and is yearly for non-business cases while permanent (except for opt-out once) for business persons. Taxpayers can also continue under the older regime of higher tax and more deductions.

Elective tax provisions are now becoming a trend in India. This proposal would not only make tax compliance simpler but also leave additional funds with the taxpayer, which will largely be expended in consumption. This may discourage small investments but should help the economy through growth in demand. Being elective, taxpayers have the option to choose between savings and consumption.

Transfer pricing: The 30 per cent ceiling on interest deduction on loans from related parties will not apply for loans from the Indian branch of a foreign bank.

Taxpayer’s Charter: The Central Board of Direct Taxes will be empowered to declare a Taxpayer’s Charter which will govern the functioning of the tax administration. This is intended to deliver a better experience for taxpayers in their interactions with the tax department. Since this will be legally mandated, the tax administration can be held responsible for the Charter’s application.

Stateless persons: As per the Finance Bill, Indian citizens who are not liable to tax in India on global income and also not liable to tax in any other country due to domicile, residence, etc., will be deemed to be Indian tax residents and subject to tax in India. As per media reports, the government has issued a press release that this will apply only to income earned outside India but derived from an Indian business or profession. Similarly, NRIs visiting India for more than 120 days (earlier 182 days) in a year will be treated as resident.

This will prevent tax avoidance by people managing their affairs in such a way as to avoid tax residence in any country. However, genuine NRIs living/working overseas will not be affected. Such persons should also get treaty protection. The reduction of threshold for visiting NRIs may impact trade in a mobile world.

Catching up with technology in business: Foreign businesses without a physical presence in India will be deemed to have a taxable business presence in India if they have income from (a) advertisements targeting Indian customers, (b) sale of data collected from India using an Indian IP address, and (c) sale of goods/services using such data. Similarly, income of foreign businesses from the sale, distribution or exhibition of cinematographic films will be taxable as royalty.

While the domestic law in this case is amended, this provision may not be implementable until the tax treaties are renegotiated, except where covered under multilateral instruments (MLI).

TDS on e-commerce transactions: E-commerce platform operators will now deduct 1 per cent TDS from payments to Indian residents selling goods/providing services through the platforms.



In respect of both the above type of transactions, it was expected that a digital tax as in the UK and France, among other countries would be introduced. These proposals are probably a precursor to a digital tax.

To reduce taxpayer-administrator interface, electronic facilities will be introduced for penalty and appeal proceedings, and for registration of charitable/religious trusts.

Faceless assessments have just been introduced and the administration has not been tested yet. Expansion could be deferred for seamless introduction after rectifying the initial challenges in e-assessment.

Ease of compliance: Foreign companies having only dividend, royalty or FTS income will not file tax returns if tax is withheld at domestic law rates. Any treaty benefit would require filing. Considering India’s vast treaty network, this may have limited application.

Tax audit: SMEs having turnover of up to Rs 5 crore (earlier Rs 1 crore) will not require a tax audit, provided not more than 5 per cent of receipts/payment is in cash. This is a bait towards a less cash-intensive economy, but can be difficult to prove in practice for the taxpayer.

Fake invoice: Fraudulent claims of GST credit through false invoices will attract penalty under the income tax laws, equivalent to false invoice amounts.

This provision should be a deterrent but needs careful administration to avoid double jeopardy through other penal provisions for unexplained credit.

Pre-filled returns: Audit/ accountant’s reports will be filed one month ahead of the due date of return for enabling pre-filling of data in the tax return. Similarly, deduction of donations will be pre-filled in the tax returns based on an information return to be filed by donees. This would prevent false claim but donees need to key in data correctly.

Reduce litigation

Vivad se vishwas: A one-time scheme to resolve pending disputes has been announced. The framework will be open up to June 30, 2020. Applicants opting before March 31, 2020 will have to settle only tax demanded, and after March 31, 2020 will have to pay an additional amount. The scheme will be notified.

This scheme is a substantial improvement over that introduced in 2016 which waived only a part of the penalty and wasn’t so successful. The ‘Sabka vishwas’ scheme introduced for indirect taxes in 2019, with similar terms, was very successful. This scheme will also garner revenue for the government by the year-end.

Kaushik Mukerjee, Partner-Tax & Regulatory, PwC India

Non-corporate foreign assessees will also be eligible to approach the DRP, which will fast-track their litigation. Further, the DRP route will be open to any dispute irrespective of variation of income.

Pre-deposit before stay application to ITAT: The 20 per cent pre-deposit will henceforth be required. This may amount to curtailment of the powers of a quasi-judicial body and can face judicial scrutiny.

Transfer pricing: The scope of Safe Harbour and Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) will now cover attribution of profits to a Permanent Establishment (PE). This will provide certainty to business transactions for cross-border related parties. Given the expertise in APA administration, the results are expected to be much more scientific than arrived at through litigation. The scope of Advance Rulings can be similarly expanded to benefit other international transactions. Additionally, even unrelated parties can be allowed to approach APAs for similar profit attribution.

Conclusion

Overall, the proposals are intended to accelerate economic momentum and ease of living for taxpayers. The true experience of the simplest and smoothest direct taxes will lie in their administration.

['Jash Kriplani'],"Market participants are expecting near-term volatility with the Union Budget skipping sector-specific stimulus packages for stressed segments such as real estate and non-bank financial services, and failing to meet domestic investors’ expectations on relaxing long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax.

Experts say selling pressure on the stock market may continue on Monday, even though $173-billion liquidity infusion by China’s central bank to boost its economy could provide some cushion.

On Saturday, the benchmark indices closed near their day’s lows, indicating further selling pressure on the following trading day. The Sensex ended 988 points, or 2.43 per cent, lower at 39,736 points, while the Nifty50 fell 300 points, or 2.51 per cent.

“The market was expecting the Budget to do more, given the domestic and global uncertainty. Over the next few days, the market is expected to absorb the volatility,” said Gaurav Dua, head of capital market strategy of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Foreign brokerages expect the risk-off stance to continue at least in the short term. “In the near term, the markets may gravitate back towards large-cap quality and defensive stocks. However, in the medium term, we expect equities to be largely driven by underlying mid-teens earnings growth,” said Goldman Sachs in a note.

The broking house has maintained the Nifty target of 13,000 by the end of 2020.

“Too early to say whether Budget Day volatility was a one-day event. We will have to see the market reaction this week as several institutional investors, especially foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), may not have participated as it was a Saturday,” said Krishna Sanghavi, chief investment officer (CIO) at Mahindra Mutual Fund.

Further, fund managers say a broader market recovery could get delayed as markets digest the implications of the Budget.

Flows from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) can come back into the markets as the Budget relaxed taxation for overseas investors. For FPIs, dividend distribution tax would be calculated at the treaty agreements, and not attract domestic taxation rates. According to experts, this can have a material impact on the net equity returns of FPIs. On Saturday, FPIs sold Rs 1,200 crore worth of equities.

“We are generally positive on the Budget and we believe the market will gradually understand the positives from the Budget, after the knee-jerk reaction,” said Shankar Sharma, vice-chairman and joint managing director of First Global. Experts add that once the Budget-related noise abates, the market focus is likely to shift to earnings and global cues. “Future FPI inflows will depend on how economic and earnings growth play out,” said a fund manager.

For domestic investors, it was expected that the holding period for calculating LTCG tax on equity would be increased to two years. The stock market could find a stable footing on Monday as the China market is resuming trade and the Chinese government will be launching $173 billion worth of liquidity. Also, experts say the fallout of novel coronavirus will have an impact on emerging markets and India in the coming days.

Kumar said the idea behind the listing of LIC was to “bring in more transparency and allow the company to share gains with its stakeholders”. “It is very important as it will bring in the disclosure norms,” he said.

The sovereign guarantee for all policies issued by LIC will continue, the secretary added.

A top government official said the enterprise value of LIC was roughly Rs 36 trillion “according to the latest figures in the balance sheet”. The official said the government might not dilute “more than 10 per cent” in LIC. “It will certainly be less than 10 per cent,” the official added.

The government might seek exemption from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to offload less than 10 per cent in the initial public offer (IPO).

All companies are required to offer at least 10 per cent in the IPO.

Finance Minister had announced a stake sale in LIC through an initial public offer in the Union Budget of 2020-21.

The government aims to mop up Rs 90,000 crore from the listing of LIC and stake sale in IDBI Bank. The government currently owns 100 per cent in LIC.

On the stake sale of IDBI Bank, which is substantially owned and controlled by LIC, Kumar said the government was exploring various options, including a strategic stake sale. The government currently holds around 46 per cent in IDBI Bank.

“It is proposed to sell the balance holding of the government in IDBI Bank to private, retail and institutional investors through the stock exchange,” Sitharaman said during her Budget speech on Saturday.

IDBI Bank had become a private bank last year when LIC acquired a controlling stake in it.

['Indivjal Dhasmana'],"Finance Minister on Sunday said the new tax regime proposed in her second Budget would ultimately lead to lower rates with simple structure.

Dismissing criticism that the new regime would not be largely beneficial to the assessees, she said, “eventually this should lead to a system where people are taxed at the lowest possible rate and are given a simple system. I am starting a scheme, which will eventually end there. For this, I’m not forcing people.” She was speaking to the media in an informal interaction a day after presenting the Union Budget in Parliament.

The FM disagreed with experts who termed the new tax regime complex and unavailing. She said the new scheme would benefit some taxpayers falling in certain brackets, if not all.

“…because the income tax cuts are deeper in the new scheme, we believe a taxpayer from a particular income bracket will be much better off coming into the new system. And in the new system, which however much I repeatedly say has no exemptions, there are some exemptions that we have allowed,” Sitharaman said.

Industry experts, however, argued that two tax regimes with optionality for personal tax, as in case of corporate taxes, only make the structure more complicated. Analysts sent out data to explain how the new tax regime would not be beneficial for those who take exemptions.

But the minister said, “I believe many of the calculations have probably not taken into account the exemptions which have been allowed in the scheme.”



Sources in the finance ministry said 53 million out of a total of 57 million taxpayers in 2018-19 had claimed exemptions of less than Rs 2 lakh. In other words, only 4 million or less than 10 per cent taxpayers took exemptions of more than Rs 2 lakh.

Analysts based their analyses on those claiming deductions in the range of Rs 4 lakh to 5 lakh, which is a small proportion of the taxpayer base.

Archit Gupta, founder of Cleartax, said, “With the optional new regime, taxpayers will have to evaluate what works better for them. Those committed to long-term savings and investing via 80C may be discouraged and this may likely demotivate them from investing in tax-saving asset classes.”



Among others, Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar- Shaw tweeted that removal of exemptions and dividend distribution tax would hurt the individual taxpayer, impacting consumer spending.

Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking said the widely expected personal income tax cuts had come in with lots of caveats, leaving no major impact.

To a query that removal of exemptions would hit insurance companies, Sitharaman said the government was giving more money to the people and it’s up to them to choose a product.",https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-s-budget-goal-lower-rates-simple-structure-120020300028_1.html,Business Standard,Budget,TRUE

['Abhishek Waghmare'],"Finance minister presented an ambitious Budget for 2020-21 last weekend, but the impact of economic slump was visible in the fine print. Let us see through this, step-by-step, to understand how the Budget math was worked out.

The overall spending in 2019-20 was curtailed by nearly Rs 90,000 crore in comparison to the expected spending. This happened despite the fact that fiscal deficit was raised from 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 3.8 per cent, showing that deficit widened during a fiscal contraction, a big worry (Chart 1).

Slowdown in economic growth has taken a clear toll on revenue growth, as Chart 2 shows. But the government expects economic activity to pick up in FY21, and push revenue growth up, too.

The externalities of this are severe. For instance, cheaper food for the poor would be increasingly financed from investments made by small savers, as government is unable to spend from its coffers (Chart 3).

Such financing by tapping into the National Small Savings Fund would take the real fiscal deficit close to 4.4 per cent of GDP (Chart 4).

A bigger worry, however, is the nature of the fiscal deficit. In FY21, a bigger part of the fiscal deficit will be used to fund revenue expenses such as welfare schemes, salaries and pensions, interest payments (Chart 5).

Capex is rising, but its load is being taken up by public enterprises in the last few years, so much that the latter has fast outpaced the former (Chart 6).

The uncertainty about budgetary spending, widening of deficit, and ambiguity on growth uptick would weigh on February’s monetary policy decision. But a bigger worry is bond yields remaining stubborn, or worse, rising (Chart 7).

“The Union Budget 2020-21 is a continuation to the corporation tax cuts announced in September 2019.

"['Shrimi Choudhary', 'Indivjal Dhasmana']","In what seemed like a partial rollback, the Finance Ministry on Sunday clarified that non-resident Indians (NRIs) would be liable to pay tax only on income derived from business or profession in India.

The Union Budget had proposed on Saturday that NRIs had to pay up taxes on global earnings if they were not paying in any other jurisdiction or country, generating much debate.

The ministry said it was an anti-abuse provision amid growing instances of NRIs shifting their stay in low or no-tax jurisdiction to avoid tax payment in India.

“An NRI living in another country earns money there, which is not taxed there at all, but has some earnings through something in India and does not pay tax here either because he does not live here. What we are saying is this: for the income generated in India, pay a tax. If you have a property here that generates rental income, but because you live there, you carry this income there and pay tax neither there nor here,’’ Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a press briefing on Sunday.

“Have I got even a sovereign right to take that into my consideration or not? I am not taxing what you earn in Dubai,” she added.

Adding to that narrative, the (CBDT) also put out a clarification on Sunday saying, “the new provision is not intended to include in tax net those Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries.’’



It added that in some sections of the media, the new provision is being interpreted as one creating an impression that those Indians who are bonafide workers in other countries, including in West Asia, and who are not liable to pay tax in these countries, will be taxed in India on the income that they have earned there. “This interpretation is not correct,’’ CBDT said.

Amit Maheshwari, Partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, states, “The intent seems to be to only tax the Indian incomes or those overseas incomes which are derived from an Indian business or profession, of such stateless NRIs. This is an anti-abuse provision and would target NRIs who have arranged their affairs in a way to avoid Indian taxes.”



The move was triggered by several cases where the income-tax department had issued notices to NRIs to reopen tax assessments of the last five to six years, seeking photocopies of their passports.

The tax department is of the view that NRIs and entities, which were named in various global leaks such as Panama and Paradise Papers and being probed under the Act, had shifted base to conceal their foreign accounts.

Further, the opening up of NRI investments into G-Secs (government securities) is a step towards getting India included in the global bond indices.

Tax exemption to sovereign wealth funds on infra investments, equity infusion into IIFCL and the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, as well as proposed InvIT (infrastructure investment trusts) structures for roads and power grids, will attract new pools of institutional money into the infrastructure sector.

The government’s decision of upholding power purchase agreements as well as the opening up of railways, city gas distribution, and electricity supply to the private sector, are welcome steps. These will help break long-standing monopolies and benefit consumers with better pricing and services.

The on-shoring of the bullion market at the IFSC at GIFT City will enable price discovery of precious metals traded overseas by Indians. Also, trading in rupee derivatives and withholding tax incentive on listing of masala bonds will make GIFT City compete well with other IFSCs.

The book titled ""An Extraordinary Life: A biography of Manohar Parrikar"" is written by veteran journalists Sadguru Patil and Mayabhushan Nagvenkar. Tuesday marks the first death anniversary of Parrikar who died after battling pancreatic cancer for over a year. He was 63.

A ""nuanced and sensitive narration"", the book claims to be an ""insightful and captivating read, complete with the informed voices of his relatives, friends, foes, bureaucrats and IIT contemporaries"".

""Manohar Parrikar was a towering personality, who defined an era in Goa's politics, after the turbulent 1990s which produced 13 chief ministers in a decade. A four-time chief minister and defence minister, he had the talent, intellect and the drive to achieve, perhaps even more,"" said co-author Sadguru Patil.

Parrikar was among the few from Goa who made it to the national level. He held the defence portfolio in the Modi government from 2014 till 2017 before returning to his first love, Goa, to take over the chief minister's post.

The biography, according to Nagvenkar, is ""a lively scrapbook of his Tom Sawyer-like childhood and youth"", as well as a ""no-holds-barred report card of his subsequent political journey, through the voices of people who knew him, many of them intimately"".

The authors, Patil and Nagvenkar, interviewed the politician many times over the course of their careers, closely followed his rise in politics and witnessed the many battles he had to undergo in his life.

An admitted workaholic who insisted on leading a simple life, Parrikar, a metallurgist by training, enjoyed acceptance from all sections of the BJP and beyond. He played a key role in making the BJP a force to reckon with in Goa, which for the longest time was a Congress bastion.

""Manohar Parrikar was a popular, astute and grassroots leader of the BJP who served as the chief minister of Goa for multiple terms, as well as the defence minister of India.

It is making the online content and access to Prutor free to any university and college in the world which cannot take physical classes anymore due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most colleges have to cancel taking the physical classes in the classrooms, to prevent the virus from spreading. IIT's, IISc, NIT's, and other institutions are just a few of the list of colleges cancelling the classes.

Interested educational institutions can sign up through an online portal (https://prutor.ai/) and will have free access through July 31, 2020 for any number of students.

On March 14, following the announcement of Dr. Amey decision, IIT Kanpur Prof. Mahendra K. Verma said that he thinks that ""given that the classes are off, this is a wonderful opportunity for anyone to explore the wonderful world of Python."" He has also made his online course on advanced Python available for free during this duration.

Dr. Amey said that only the top Indian universities are prepared to introduce online learning, but that many others do not have the necessary infrastructure to run the courses on their own. IIT Kanpur says Dr. Amey and Dr. Sandeep Shukla are successfully teaching thousands of engineering students through Prutor.

Prutor is a revolutionary and proprietary technology developed at IIT Kanpur over the last six years utilizing thousands of hours of teachers and students. It has already been adopted by IIT Mumbai, IIT Goa, IIT Madras and other leading institutions to teach coding. According to Dr. Amey ""Any student above 8th grade can learn programming using Prutor"". He is also making available lectures in both Hindi and English to any college or university that is interested.

Until recently, this advanced tools and associated video lectures were available only to IIT's like IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and IIT Goa, who have used Prutor to teach programming to thousands of students. But seeing that due to virus, a lot of students will have free time, Dr. Amey and Dr. Mahendra K.

['Press Trust Of India'],"/ -- These indeed are peculiar times, which you sometimes have heard from the older generation about our lifestyle, eating habits and especially our buying choices. Where your mom will still choose to go all the way to the market place physically, surfing through a shop to shop to find that perfect furniture or fresh vegetables, millennials are now taking a turn to their laptops and mobile phones when comes to such purchases. What can be a possible reason for this?



Authencity is rapidly increasing in the case of online portals. They are no more considered ""shady"" because of being heavily marketed on digital and print media, and even word of mouth. It solves other concerns like:



Easy to research: Because they are promoted online, the mere power of Google can take you to several options, reviews and types for a single item which you wish to buy.

No hassle from a public place POV: People can buy, research, compare and what not by sitting in their car, office, home and even washroom without waiting or sweating in hot weather or queues!



The whole world is your market: You buying capacity is no more confined to your own locality, city or even the country; the whole wild world is now a field for you to choose and buy things from.

The above stated are the reasons why many brands are now switching to either e-commerce websites or mobile applications so that they are more approachable to their consumers and can bank on this changing consumer behavior. Even the ones who don't agree with this trend fundamentally, are switching to it from a business perspective.

While upgrading to e-commerce and mobile application, they also are switching to marketing their products as well online through social media marketing as most of the research is done there by the potential client because first, these platforms provide information as well as they visit & update on the same every day. This is a ground for them to target, influence and target.

But what is even more necessary is choosing an agency which understands the market and current technology. A right agency will help you launch your e-commerce keeping in the new developments both from the technological aspect but also a presentation of it.

Puneet Vig, founder of Doors Studio said, ""It is a growing market in which brands must invest in for reaping long-lasting results, especially for one launching a product in the market! E-commerce and mobile applications are the need of the hour and they must bank on.""

['Press Trust Of India'],"Due to the coronavirus pandemic, most airlines in the world will be bankrupt by the end of May and only a coordinated government and industry action right now can avoid the catastrophe, said global aviation consultancy firm CAPA in a note on Monday.

""As the impact of the coronavirus and multiple government travel reactions sweep through our world, many airlines have probably already been driven into technical bankruptcy, or are at least substantially in breach of debt covenants,"" it stated.

Across the world, airlines have announced drastic reduction in their operations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. For example, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines stated on Sunday that it would be grounding 300 aircraft in its fleet and reduce flights by 40 per cent.

The US has suspended all tourist visas for people belonging to the European Union, the UK and Ireland. Similarly, the Indian government has suspended all tourist visas and e-visas granted on or before March 11.

CAPA, in its note on Monday, said, ""By the end of May-2020, most airlines in the world will be bankrupt. Coordinated government and industry action is needed - now - if catastrophe is to be avoided.""



Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded and ""what flights there are operate much less than half full"", it added.

""Forward bookings are far outweighed by cancellations and each time there is a new government recommendation it is to discourage flying. Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon,"" it said.

India's largest airline IndiGo -- which has around 260 planes in its fleet -- said on Thursday that it has seen a decline of 15-20 per cent in daily bookings in the last few days.

The low-cost carrier had stated that it expects its quarterly earnings to be materially impacted due to such decline.

CAPA said the failure to coordinate the future will result in protectionism and much less competition.

""The alternative does not bear thinking about. An unstructured and nationalistic outcome will not be survival of the fittest.

""It will mostly consist of airlines that are the biggest and the best-supported by their governments. The system will reek of nationalism. And it will not serve the needs of the 21st century world. That is not a prospect that any responsible government should be prepared to contemplate,"" the consultancy firm said.

,"The State Election Commissioner (SEC) of Andhra Pradesh defended the decision to postpone the local body elections for six weeks in the state citing the health advisory issued by the Centre over coronavirus.

The clarification came after Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Sunday slammed the decision of postponing the local body elections for six weeks and alleged that SEC was acting at the behest of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu.

""In the contest of certain aspersions cast on the decisions taken by the State Election Commission, the factual clarification is as follows--The Government of India had issued a health advisory to the states to -avoid larger public gatherings some time back. On March 14, the Government of India had classified coronavirus as a 'disaster' and kept the nation in a state of preparedness. The State Election Commissioner did contact level functionaries before taking a decision on the threat 'Corona' posed,"" a press note by the SEC on Sunday read.

""If the aforesaid warning is de-escalated, the State Election Commission will restart the election process without loss of a single day,"" it added.

The SEC further clarified that the Commission is of the view that ""the present elections are merely put on a hold and not canceled"", and added that they could be restarted in six weeks or before, if the threat posed by the diseases is de-escalated.

Regarding the allegations of violence during the ongoing election process, levied by opposition parties, the SEC said ""Violence in the ongoing elections is a matter that is engaging the attention of the Commission and various political parties have been highlighting the surge of violence. This is also a subject matter in ongoing litigation before the High Court in Writ Petition (PIL) No. 65 of 2020 in which the State Election Commission is the respondent.""

""The State Election Commission is a Constitutional body and the Commissioner is at par, with the Judge of High Court. All the safeguards available to a Judge of High Court are applicable to the State Election Commissioner. To attribute motives for the acts of a Constitutional functionary are highly regretted and will only weaken the institution,"" it read.

CM Jagan Mohan Reddy had earlier indirectly said that it appears the SEC was acting at the behest of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu.

""It seems the Election Commissioner is being directed from behind. The order is prepared without the notice of even his secretary. Present State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar was appointed by N Chandrababu Naidu. Ramesh belongs to the same caste as Naidu's. The primary nature of the EC should be that he should act impartially and rise above caste, creed, religion, race, region, and party as far as work goes,"" the Chief Minister said.

""Andhra Pradesh Election Commissioner has postponed the local body elections citing coronavirus as the reason. But at the same time, he transferred two district collectors and some police officers and suspended some police officers. He issued orders to stop the housing 'pattas' distribution scheme to be launched on March 25, which was announced a long time back. How can he do so?"" he added.Commenting upon the coronavirus outbreak, Reddy added: ""The impact of coronavirus is more on people who are above 60 years and have ill-health records. In 80 per cent of people, it comes and goes. Action should be taken, and we are taking it. But I don't think there is a situation of panic at least in our State.

Earlier, as political uncertainty developed in Madhya Pradesh, BJP and Congress had moved their legislators out of the state and lodged them in luxury hotels, apparently in a bid to keep their respective flock intact.

Scindia's decision to leave Congress was followed by the resignation from 22 party MLAs loyal to him.

,"BJP leader Lanka Dinakar said that Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's comment over the sitaution prevailing due to the coronavirus pandemic shows his ""arrogance"".

The Chief Minister's remark came following the State Election Commissioner's decision of postponing the local body elections for six weeks in Andhra Pradesh.

""CM Jagan Mohan Reddy's arrogant comments about coronavirus is objectionable. As per his views, this (coronavirus) is like a routine process and its impact on India and Andhra Pradesh is negligible. While neighboring states have taken all precautionary measures, Reddy's priority is his arrogance and therefore he wants to complete the local body polls at any cost,"" Dinakar told ANI on Sunday evening.

""Already more than 20 percent local body results have been declared unanimously.YSRCP party representatives have threatened the opposition candidates and the people. Jagan's administration functions as per his whims and fancies without considering the public good,"" he added.

The Andhra Pradesh CM on Sunday slammed State Election Commissioner's decision of postponing the local body elections for six weeks and indirectly criticised that it appears the SEC was acting at the behest of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu.

""It seems the Election Commissioner is being directed from behind. The order is prepared without the notice of even his secretary. Present State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar was appointed by N Chandrababu Naidu. Ramesh belongs to the same caste as Naidu's. The primary nature of the EC should be that he should act impartially and rise above caste, creed, religion, race, region, and party as far as work goes,"" the Chief Minister said.

""Andhra Pradesh Election Commissioner has postponed the local body elections citing coronavirus as the reason. But at the same time, he transferred two district collectors and some police officers and suspended some police officers. He issued orders to stop the housing 'pattas' distribution scheme to be launched on March 25, which was announced a long time back. How can he do so?"" he added.

Commenting upon the coronavirus outbreak, Reddy had said: ""The impact of coronavirus is more on people who are above 60 years and have ill-health records. In 80 percent of people, it comes and goes. Action should be taken, and we are taking it. But I don't think there is a situation of panic at least in our State. I don't think it is such a big reason for postponing the local body elections.""

According to the State Election Commissioner, N Ramesh Kumar, the new dates for the Andhra Pradesh local body polls will be finalised after normalcy is restored in the state.Asserting that the decision had been taken after a high-level review of the situation, Kumar also mentioned that the process of election will not be canceled.

Retail sales fell 20.5% from a year earlier after shopping malls and other businesses were closed in late January, government data showed Monday. Factory output declined by a record 13.5% after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended to keep manufacturers and offices closed.

The data were even bleaker than economists expected. They warned manufacturers and others will struggle despite official efforts to reopen factories and other businesses in many areas while preventing a new spike in infections.

This is not the end of the nightmare. Watch out! wrote economist Iris Pang of ING in a report.

The ruling party has eased some controls and allowed factories and some other businesses to reopen in many areas. But companies and economists say it will be months before activity returns to normal levels.

They say that might be pushed back further because the United States and European governments are imposing travel and other curbs that will depress demand for Chinese exports.

The latest data point to an even deeper contraction this quarter, said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.

The March data are likely to be even worse, said Evans-Pritchard.

The January-February period looks better because it includes the start of January, before anti-virus controls hit, said Evans Pritchard.

Further ahead, the pace of recovery is likely to remain slow, he said. The global spread of the virus will hold back the rebound in exports, even as factories return to normal operation. Investment by private businesses tumbled 26.4% while commercial real estate sales plummeted 39.9%, the National Bureau of Statistics reported.

['Press Trust Of India'],"The novel coronavirus may not transmit from pregnant mothers to newborn babies at birth, according to a study published on Monday.

The study is the second out of China within the last month to confirm that mothers infected with COVID-19 disease during pregnancy did not pass the virus to their babies, said researchers from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The research, published in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics, was carried out on four women who gave birth at Wuhan's Union Hospital while infected.

Wuhan in China's Hubei Province is believed to be the epicentre of the current outbreak that has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 6,000.

None of the infants developed any serious symptoms associated with COVID-19 such as fever or cough, though all were initially isolated in neonatal intensive care units and fed formula, the researchers said.

Three of the four tested negative for the respiratory infection following a throat swab, while the fourth child's mother declined permission for the test, they said.

One newborn did experience a minor breathing issue for three days that was treated by non-invasive mechanical ventilation, according to the study.

Two babies, including the one with a respiratory problem, did have body rashes that eventually disappeared on their own.

""We are not sure the rash was due to the mother's COVID-19 infection,"" said study co-author Yalan Liu at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

All four infants remain healthy, and their mothers also fully recovered.

In the previous study on nine pregnant mothers infected with COVID-19, the researchers also found no evidence that the viral infection can pass to the child.

All nine births were done by cesarean section. Three of the four pregnancies in the current study were also brought to term by C-section.

""To avoid infections caused by perinatal and postnatal transmission, our obstetricians think that C-section may be safer,"" said Liu, who also works at Union Hospital.

""Only one pregnant mother adopted vaginal delivery because of the onset of the labour process. The baby was normal. Maybe vaginal delivery is OK. It needs further study,"" she said.

In previous coronavirus outbreaks, scientists found no evidence of viral transmission from mother to child, but SARS and MERS were both associated with ""critical maternal illness, spontaneous abortion, or even maternal death,"" according to Liu.

['Press Trust Of India'],"A largest oil and gas conference which draws tens of thousands of visitors each year from around the world, including India, has been postponed in Houston due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the organisers have announced.

The organisers of the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC), the largest Oil and gas conference in Houston, announced that the event has been postponed to the third quarter of 2020. The group is working to confirm new dates for the event in August or September, according to a statement the event organisers.

""By postponing rather than cancelling OTC, we aim to preserve the significant work of the programme committee and authors to prepare for this conference, as well as minimize the economic impact this decision will have on the businesses in Houston and throughout the industry,"" the statement added.

The conference, which drew about 60,000 attendees last year, was set to take place May 4 to 7 at NRG Center in Houston.

The OTC announcement cited the ""rapidly changing guidance from governments and companies"" as a reason for moving the event from May to later in the year.

""The Offshore Technology Conference recognises the unprecedented global challenge associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic,"" the announcement states.

""The health and safety of our partners, attendees, exhibitors, staff and community are of the utmost importance, and our hearts go out to all who have been affected.""



In the coming weeks, the OTC will be communicating with authors, speakers, exhibitors, and partners to develop the new plans and ensure the conference continues to provide a platform for energy professionals to meet and exchange ideas.

Since 1969, the OTC has been a reliable source of technology and knowledge sharing to propel the offshore industry forward. The conference has also been a key economic driver for the city of Houston and neighbouring communities.

The OTC is a series of conferences and exhibitions, focused on the exchanging technical knowledge relevant to the development of offshore energy resources, primarily oil and natural gas.

As the coronavirus outbreak grew, companies started limiting employees' travel, and events that attracted people from all over the world had been discouraged. One of the first such events to be cancelled in Houston was CERAWeek, another high-profile energy event that attracts about 5,500 delegates from over 80 countries along with more than 840 speakers.

Countless events that bring significant groups of people together are being cancelled as health officials encourage social distancing and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Sunday limiting gatherings of more than 50 people for next 8 weeks.

The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo which recorded a total attendance of about 2.5 million people over 21 days in 2019 was cancelled on March 11 when Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced he was issuing an emergency health declaration for the city.

,"An Australian television network entertainment editor has tested positive for the new coronavirus after meeting Tom Hanks' wife, Rita Wilson, in Sydney.

Hanks and Wilson have been isolated in an Australian hospital since they were both diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 12.

Authorities said last week several contacts Hanks and Wilson had in Australia were being traced, but no other results of those efforts have been made public.

Nine Network entertainment editor Richard Wilkins said Monday that he was tested because he met Wilson at the Sydney Opera House on March 7 and again at Nine's Sydney studio on March 9. The result came back positive on Sunday.

I'm surprisingly very well, Wilkins told Nine by Facetime from his Sydney home, where he has self-isolated since Wilson's diagnosis.

You could've knocked me over with a feather last night when I got that call. It took me a couple of minutes to reel from the that they gave me. But I feel fine. I feel 100%, Wilkins added.

The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people but can be severe in some cases, especially older adults and people with existing health problems. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

The 65-year-old journalist said he could only assume that he had been infected by Wilson, a singer and actor.

We're assuming this is from Rita. It may not be. They've all said it could be anyone, anywhere, any time, such is the prevalence of this thing, Wilkins said.

I was having a chat to her and that's probably my best guess as to what happened, he added.

Wilkins was one of 37 new case confirmed over 24 hours in New South Wales state, bringing the state total to 171 by Monday. The increase was the largest for Australia's most populous state in a day. Authorities say at least 67 cases arrived from overseas and 44 were transmitted locally while the remainder could not be determined or were still under investigation.

Wilkins' celebrity son Christian Wilkins had been tested on Monday because he had spent the night of March 10 in his father's Sydney home. The 25-year-old son is currently competing in the Australian version of the reality TV show Dancing With the Stars, which is being broadcast without a studio audience because of the COVID-19 risk.

Richard Wilkins said he did not inform his son until after he had danced on the program, which is performed in a Melbourne studio on Sunday nights.

I called him up after his show last night. He was and still is very, very upset, the father said.

He's going to get tested in an hour and, fingers crossed, he'll be OK, which I'm sure he is, he added.

Two Nine hosts who interviewed Wilson in their Sydney studio on March 9, David Campbell and Belinda Russell, remained in isolation in their homes on Monday waiting on test results.

Hanks' diagnosis prompted an outpouring of get-well wishes in Australia and Hollywood.

Hanks had been in Queensland state shooting an Elvis Presley biopic directed by Baz Luhrmann. The double Oscar winner plays Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker.

The film, slated for release in October 2021, has suspended production, Warner Bros. said.

On Wall Street, futures for the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 5% on Sunday night and triggered a halt in trading.

The Fed cut its key rate by a full percentage point to a range between zero and 0.25% and said it would stay there until it feels confident the economy can survive a near-shutdown of activity in the United States.

Despite whipping out the big guns,"" the Fed's action is ""falling short of being the decisive backstop for markets, said Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank in a report.

Markets might have perceived the Fed's response as panic, feeding into its own fears.

Japan's central bank was holding a policy meeting, convened several days earlier than planned. Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to do whatever is needed to help buttress slumping economic growth after the economy contracted at a 7.1% annual rate in the last quarter, before the impact of the virus outbreak had even been felt.

Western governments have shut public facilities and imposed travel curbs, raising the cost of efforts to contain the outbreak that has infected nearly 170,000 people worldwide. China, where the coronavirus emerged in December, accounts for about half of those, but a dozen other countries have more than 1,000 cases each.

Spain followed Italy's lead in imposing nationwide curbs will allow its 46 million people to leave home only to go to work, to buy food and medicine or on errands to care for the young and elderly. In the Philippines, soldiers and police sealed off the crowded capital, Manila, from most domestic travelers.

New York City announced it will shut down the largest U.S. public school system as early as Tuesday, sending more than 1.1 million children home. Governors in California, Illinois and Ohio told all bars and restaurants to close or reduce their number of customers.

In Sydney, the S&P-ASX 200 fell to 5,468.8. The he Shanghai Composite Index retreated to 2,873.07 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng tumbled to 23,597.15. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was little-changed at 17,726.98.

The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.2% to 1,767.55 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 lost 5.3% to 5,246.10.

Brent crude lost $1.01 to $32.84 per barrel in London. Benchmark U.S. crude tumbled 1.8%, or 56 cents, to $31.17 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

That followed a dizzying week in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average twice fell by more than 2,000 points and also record its biggest point gain ever 1,985 points on Friday. The bull market that began in 2009 in the depths of the financial crisis came to an end. Europe markets saw similar volatility.

JPMorgan Chase now is forecasting the U.S. economy will shrink at a 2% annual rate in the current quarter and 3% in the April-June quarter.

The Fed's decision to act before a meeting scheduled for mid-week indicated its policymakers felt they needed to move immediately to shore up investor confidence. Most market watchers expected more volatility ahead because the number of U.S. virus cases is rising and more industries face a downturn.

United Airlines said it needs to cut flying capacity by 50% in April and May and expects the cuts to extend into the summer travel season. American Airlines said it cutting international flying 75%.

Walmart is limiting hours to ensure stores can keep sought-after items such as hand sanitizer in stock. Late Friday, Apple said it was closing all retail stores outside of China.

Besides cutting rates, the Fed will buy at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. This amounts to an effort to ease market disruptions that have made it harder for banks and large investors to sell Treasuries as well as to keep longer-term rates borrowing rates down.

The magnitude of the central bank moves indicated to some analysts that Chair Jerome Powell and other members of the Fed were worried about the health of the financial system. But others noted the Fed was just reacting to signs the situation in Europe and the U.S. was only getting worse.

The Fed's actions were very bold and it does appear to have spooked the markets, said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation at Manulife Investment Management.

Markets were going to be spooked anyway due to the scale of the shutdowns across the U.S. and sobering implications of a $20 trillion dollar economy that is about to grind down to a crawl, said Yung-yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.

Also, developments in Europe are raising the prospect that what was just a week ago considered 'worst case' might be closer to 'base case' for the U.S., Ma said. Big picture, the Fed's actions are all positive.

['Press Trust Of India'],"US President Donald Trump has advised his countrymen against hoarding of essential items as reports of grocery stores being swept by panic buying due to the coronavirus crisis emerged, saying supply chains in the country are the most powerful in the world and there is no shortage of daily goods.

The US mainstream media, including newspapers and channels, on Sunday showed pictures and visuals of empty shelves in grocery stores in the country.

Visuals of lockdown-like situation in several European countries like Italy and Spain added to the anxiety of the Americans who bought things to fill up their pantry with weeks of stocks.

In view of the situation, Trump on Sunday held a meeting with top leaders of the companies that own grocery stores, including Indian-American Vivek Sankaran, who is president and CEO of Albertsons.

I would like to say that people shouldn't go out and buy. We're going to be great. We're going to be so good, Trump told reporters at a White House conference after a meeting with nearly a dozen grocery store owners.

But you don't have to buy so much. Take it easy. Just relax. People are going in and they're buying more. I remember -- I guess, during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they're buying more than they buy at Christmas. Relax. We're doing great. It all will pass, he said.

The White House said that the supply chains in the country were strong and it was unnecessary for citizens to hoard daily essentials.

Among other prominent corporate leaders in the meeting were Dave Clark from Whole Foods; Mark Clouse of Campbell Soup Company; Brian Cornell of Target; Kevin Hourican of Sysco; Craig Jelinek of Costco; Donnie King of Tyson Foods; David MacLennan of Cargill; and Doug McMillon of Walmart.

Referring to his meeting with corporate leaders, Trump said they assured him that they are going to meet the demands of the public.

They're going around the clock, if they have to. They are committed to the communities where they're serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time. And they're buying a lot of additional things to sell, he said.

But again, they actually have asked me to say- Could you buy a little bit less, please?- I thought I'd never hear that from a retailer. All of them are working hand-in-hand with the federal government, as well as the state and local leaders, to ensure food and essentials are constantly available. And they'll do it, he said.

There's no shortages. We have no shortages -- other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy. It's going to be there for a long time, Trump said.

Asserting that the supply chains in America are the most powerful in the world, and they're all working very hard, he said that the stores are stocking up at a level that's beyond the Christmas rush.

There's no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. They said to me- Could you please tell them just go and buy, enjoy it. Have a nice dinner. Relax. Because there's plenty. But you don't have to buy the quantities because it's hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they're refilling them, Trump said.

According to the World Health Organisation data, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected 3,777 people and claimed 69 lives in the country.

The deadly virus, which originated in China, has claimed over 6,500 lives and infected more than 169,000 people over 135 countries and territories.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday announced that he has made the ""painful decision"" to suspend classes in all NYC public schools, beginning March 16. There are now 329 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City and 5 fatalities.

As of Sunday evening, the US has reported over 3,700 cases of coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19. The disease has also killed 66 people in the US has spread to over 100 countries.

""This is a decision that I have taken with no joy whatsoever, with a lot of pain, honestly, because it's something I could not in a million years have imagined having to do. But we are dealing with a challenge and a crisis that we have never seen in our lifetimes and is only just begun, he said at a press conference on Sunday.

The New York public school system is the largest in the nation and about 1.1 million students from grades kindergarten to 12 will be impacted by the move.

The city will begin remote digital learning from March 23 as it puts in place the necessary infrastructure to transition to online learning. The city will move towards the remote learning model for all school days until Spring Recess in April and students will not report to school buildings for instruction until April 20, 2020 or longer if necessary.

Apart from schools, New York would be closing all theaters, nightclubs, bars and concert halls.

""As we learn more about COVID-19 every day, we are keeping every possible option on the table to keep New Yorkers safe. That's why we are asking the people of our city to make hard choices as we introduce more restrictive measures to create greater social distancingincluding the temporary closure of our school buildings. We all need to change our livesin ways both big and smallto keep each other safe, the Mayor said.

Announcing ""yet another drastic step, de Blasio said he will sign an executive order limiting restaurants, bars and cafes to food take-out and delivery. Nightclubs, movie theaters, small theater houses, and concert venues will all close with effect from March 17, a significant measure that will ensure social distancing.

""The virus can spread rapidly through the close interactions New Yorkers have in restaurants, bars and places where we sit close together. We have to break that cycle, he said.

""This is not a decision I make lightly. These places are part of the heart and soul of our city. They are part of what it means to be a New Yorker. But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality.

Authorities across the US are asking citizens to stay home, even if they are healthy to slow the transmission of COVID-19, which has so far infected 167,700 people across the world.

""We will come through this, but until we do, we must make whatever sacrifices necessary to help our fellow New Yorkers, the Mayor said adding that he calls upon New Yorkers to watch the children of their neighbors, friends, and members of the community who work in the healthcare sector in order to keep healthcare providers unaffected due to the school closings.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also urged the state's residents to stay home in order to slow the spread of the virus. What we do next will have a massive impact on the trajectory of this virus in New York. We can only maintain public health by staying apart. The decision each of makes now will impact us all tomorrow. Stay home.

The German, whose manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for the virus on Thursday, posted a video of his cardio workout, which featured plenty of dancing and gesturing along to some of his favourite music.

Following the health guidelines over combating the virus, Mustafi also took time to video himself washing his hands, while doing keepie-uppies.

Watford's social media personnel came up with an idea to amuse fans starved of proper football as they simulated their home match against Leicester on the Football Manager computer game.

Real Madrid players, forced into quarantine by a case of coronavirus in the club's basketball squad, have been training at home, where most of them already had facilities and equipment.

Captain Sergio Ramos posted a video on Instagram showing him sprinting on a treadmill.

Marco Asensio, who suffered a knee injury last summer, posted a video showing that he was continuing his recovery programme in his garden.

But even for sportsmen used to working out, there is a limit.

Fabien Causeur, a Real Madrid basketball guard, has launched a live video channel to show his quarantine challenge.

He has been taking on athletes and celebrities in three-minute simultaneous excercise including Thibaut Courtois, the Real Madrid goalkeeper, and NBA star and former Real Madrid teammate Luka Doncic.

At Barcelona, players are following a ""specific and personalised"" programme set by the club which is monitoring their efforts remotely using biometric tags.

Napoli's Belgian forward Dries Mertens posted pictures of a work out with a huge bottle of red wine.

""We'll have nothing to do, in the middle of the season, it's never happened before. Our habits have been turned upside down,"" he said.

Thomasson is a ski fan but as other are also at a standstill that leaves a ""big void"" for this ski lover.

""I'm going to watch series, movies, it's going to be really limited.""



Television is also the refuge for James Lea Siliki, a Rennes midfielder, who tweeted the times of a couple of French quiz shows. Later he admitted a passion for a French TV karaoke show adding ""I'll spare you my voice"".

Romain Thomas, a defender at Angers, said his daily routine involved jogging, gardening and watching French reality TV.

He said he has talked to team-mates.

""We said to each other: 'Look, it's a beautiful day, it's time to mow'. So I mowed the lawn in the garden, it gives me time to think about something else.

""It's all about protecting yourself and the people around you,"" Gobert said. ""I wish I would've taken this thing more seriously and I hope everyone else is going to do so because we can do it together.

""I've been feeling a little better every single day thanks to the health care people of Utah and Oklahoma City and all the great people around,"" Gobert said.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced minutes after Gobert's positive test that the league was putting the season on indefinite hiatus.

Gobert showed how he didn't take the coronavirus threat seriously last Monday at a conference set up in a room because reporters were banned from NBA locker rooms due to the danger of catching the virus.

As he departed, Gobert made a point of touching all reporters' recorders and a microphone he used -- unaware he would test positive for coronavirus two days later. Utah teammate Donovan Mitchell tested positive for coronavirus last Thursday.

In the video, Gobert urged people do such basics as wash their hands well and refrain from touching their face and thanked those who have supported him since his positive test.

""Thank you to all the people who have been supportive for all the positive energy,"" Gobert said.

""It means a lot.

,"The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said Sunday it is suspending all matches until further notice because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The CBF had initially avoided an all-out suspension, instead ordering Friday that matches be played in empty stadiums in the country's two largest cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

But as fears over the virus' spread continued to mount, it ultimately followed the lead of the Champions League, Premier League, Bundesliga and a long list of other sporting events worldwide that have suspended their seasons.

""We know and accept the responsibility the football world has in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil,"" CBF president Rogerio Caboclo said in a statement.

""The CBF will remain in permanent contact with the health ministry, joining together to help the country and the sport overcome the challenge posed by the pandemic,"" it added.

Several key matches were played in empty stadiums this weekend in Brazil, including a Sao Paulo-Santos derby.

The pandemic has led officials to cancel or postpone a slate of top sporting events worldwide, including the top European football leagues, NBA basketball, Formula One racing and the Giro d'Italia.

""Let's wait to see what UEFA decides, but I adapt to everything, right now the priority is to save lives."" European football's governing body meet on Tuesday to discuss all domestic and European competitions, as well as Euro 2020, which is due to take place from June 12 to July 12.

Italy are set to host the opening match in Rome on June 12, in a tournament which will be played in 12 countries across the continent.

All sport in Italy has been suspended until April 3 with the nation's 60 million inhabitants in lockdown to avoid the spread of the virus which has killed 1,809 and infected over 24,000.

""The fact is that the problems we are having now other nations will have shortly,"" continued the former Manchester City and Inter Milan coach.

""First of all we need to protect people's health, we have to wait for the peak, then when this situation begins to ease off we could start talking and decide everything later.

""When we return to our normal life, to football, we will be happier, we'll find freedom, be able to go back to matches at the stadium, have fun,"" added the 55-year-old.

""These dramatic situations can make you become better. I hope so.""



Italy won all 10 of their Euro 2020 qualifying matches as they roared back under Mancini's guidance having failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.

They approach Euro 2020 searching for just their second European title after winning in 1968.

""Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities,"" the agency said in a statement.

""Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies.""



The NBA became the first major US pro league to suspend its season in the face of the coronavirus pandemic after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.

Three NBA players are now known to have tested positive.

The NHL and Major League Soccer have also suspended competition, while Major League Baseball cancelled Spring Training games and pushed back the scheduled March 26 start of its season ""at least two weeks."" The PGA Tour and LPGA Tour have cancelled tournaments into April, and the Masters, first men's major of 2020 will not take place at Augusta National April 9-12.

Honda, 33, got a hero's welcome from thousands of fans when he arrived in Brazil on February 7, but played his first match in the eery quiet of Botafogo's deserted stadium.

He was photographed training ahead of the Rio Cup tie with a mask on.

It may be his last match for some time: the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) has suspended the season until further notice because of the pandemic, effective Monday.

Wearing the number four jersey, Honda scored on a penalty kick in the 28th minute.

But Bangu equalized in the 58th.

Coach Paulo Autuori substituted Honda four minutes later.

Honda, one of the best players in Japanese football history, had been without a club since leaving Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem in December, less than two months after joining.

Since arriving in Brazil, he has tweeted about hitting Rio de Janeiro's legendary beaches and studying Portuguese.

Botafogo are looking for a boost after finishing 15th in the Brazilian league last season, barely avoiding relegation.

Formerly of AC Milan and CSKA Moscow, Honda has stood out for the Japan national team, scoring 37 goals in 98 appearances, including four World Cup goals.

['Press Trust Of India'],"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US has recommended to postpone or cancel events having a gathering of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks amid stepped up efforts to contain the rapid spread of the coronavirus that has claimed 69 lives in the country.

According to the World Health Organisation data, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected 3,777 people, including 69 deaths, in the US as the authorities placed travel restrictions, closed schools, restaurants and bars and cancelled entertainment events across the country to contain the deadly virus.

The CDC, in a statement on Sunday, said that large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the US through travellers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities.

Large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings and other types of assemblies.

These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals, it said.

""CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next 8 weeks, organisers (whether groups or individuals) cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the US,"" it said.

The national public health institute stated that events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene and social distancing. When feasible, organisers could modify events to be virtual, it said.

It, however, clarified that the recommendation does not apply to the day-to-day operation of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses.

This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus, it said.

The deadly virus, which originated in China, has claimed over 6,500 lives and infected more than 169,000 people over 135 countries and territories.

,"Officials across the country curtailed many elements of American life to fight the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, with health officials recommending that groups of 50 or more don't get together and a government expert saying a 14-day national shutdown may be needed.

Governors and mayors were closing restaurants, bars, and schools as the nation sank deeper into chaos over the crisis.

Travellers returning home from overseas trips were stuck in line for hours at major airports for screenings, causing them to be crammed into just the kind of crowded spaces that public health officials have been urging people to avoid.

In a sign of the impending economic gloom on the horizon, the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate to near zero. President Donald Trump sought to calm a jittery nation by declaring that the government has tremendous control over the situation and urging people to stop the panic buying of grocery staples that has depleted the shelves of stores around the country.

Gun stores started seeing a similar run on weapons and ammunition as the panic intensified.

As Americans struggled to come to terms with how to change their daily habits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a dramatic recommendation: Because large events can fuel the spread of the disease, it said gatherings of 50 people or more should be canceled or postponed throughout the country for the next eight weeks.

It added that, at any event, proper precautions should be taken, including making sure people are washing their hands and not getting too close.

But in a sign of the difficulty of striking the right balance, the statement from the CDC also said the recommendation does not apply to the day to day operation of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses.

Even before the warning, parts of the country already look like a ghost town, and others are about to follow as theme parks closed, Florida beaches shooed away spring breakers, Starbucks said it will accept only drive-thru and takeout orders, and Ohio and Illinois ordered bars and restaurants shuttered.

""The time for persuasion and public appeals is over, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said.

This is not a joke. No one is immune to this. California's governor asked the state's bars and restaurants to close, but didn't order it. New York City, meanwhile, said eateries could only accept takeout and delivery orders. Mayor Bill de Blasio also ordered nightclubs, movie theaters and other entertainment venues closed.

These places are part of the heart and soul of our city. They are part of what it means to be a New Yorker,"" he said in a statement Sunday night. But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality.

His decision came after Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert, said he would like to see a 14-day national shutdown imposed to prevent the virus's spread.

I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing, said Fauci, a member of the White House task force on combating the spread of coronavirus.

He heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.

There is no indication Trump is considering such a move.

The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 162,000 people and left more than 6,000 dead, with thousands of new cases confirmed each day. The death toll in the United States climbed to 64, while infections passed 3,200.

Meanwhile, harsh criticism rained on Trump and his administration Sunday from state and local officials over long lines of returning international passengers at some U.S. airports that could have turned them into coronavirus carriers as they tried to get home.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot lambasted the administration for allowing about 3,000 Americans returning from Europe to be stuck for hours inside the customs area at O'Hare International Airport on Saturday, violating federal recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that people practice social distancing."" The passengers, many of them rushing home because of fears they would be stuck in Europe, were screened for coronavirus symptoms before they were allowed to leave the airport.

Long lines also formed Saturday in Boston, Dallas and others of the 13 airports that are accepting return flights from Europe.

People were forced into conditions that are against CDC guidance and are totally unacceptable, Lightfoot said.

Elizabeth Pulvermacher, a University of Wisconsin student, arrived Saturday at O'Hare from Madrid, where she had been studying and spent hours in line. The customs process made her feel unsafe,"" she said.

The whole idea is getting rid of the spread of coronavirus, but there were hundreds and hundreds of people in very close proximity, Pulvermacher said. Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University, said he was appalled by what he saw Saturday at nearby O'Hare.

If they weren't exposed to COVID-19 before, they probably are now. From a public health perspective, this is malpractice, Murphy said in a statement Sunday.

The lack of preparation and concern is unfathomable. But the situation improved markedly Sunday at O'Hare and elsewhere.

,"U.S. stock futures fell sharply after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates and more companies and governments took action over the weekend to shut down European and American society in the face of the growing virus outbreak.

Futures for the S&P 500 fell 5% Sunday night and triggered a halt in trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,040 points, or 4.6%. The price of oil fell more than around 2% while gold gained about 1.2%.

Stocks are set for more turbulence following a dizzying week that saw the Dow twice fall by more than 2,000 points and also record it's biggest point gain ever 1,985 points on Friday. The bull market that began in 2009 in the depths of the financial crisis came to an end. Europe markets saw similar volatility.

Asia markets were mostly lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined about 2% while shares in South Korea and China slipped less than 1%. Shares in Australia dropped 4.3%.

The country's prime minister announced new travel restrictions Sunday. Japan stocks rose slightly. The Bank of Japan has called an emergency meeting for noon local time Monday.

The Fed Sunday cut its key rate by a full percentage point to a range between zero and 0.25% and said it would keep it there until it feels confident that the economy can survive a sudden near-shutdown of economic activity in the United States.

The surprise announcement signaled the Fed's concern that the viral outbreak will depress economic growth in coming months and that it is prepared to do whatever it can counter the risks.

The fact the Fed acted before a meeting scheduled for mid-week indicated its policymakers felt they needed to move immediately to shore up financial markets and investors' confidence. \



Although U.S. stocks did recoup some of last week's losses with a big rally on Friday, most market watchers expected to see more volatility ahead with the number of coronavirus cases still rising in the U.S. and more industries facing a downturn in their business.

United Airlines said it needs to cut flying capacity by 50% in April and May and expects the cuts to extend into the summer travel season.

American Airlines said it cutting international flying 75%. Walmart is limiting hours to ensure stores can keep sought-after items such as hand sanitizer in stock, while other retailers such as Urban Outfitters are closing stores altogether. Late Friday, Apple said it was closing all retail stores outside of China.

At the same time the U.S. and other countries further restricted travel and took other actions certain to curtail economic activity. In he U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that gatherings of 50 people or more be canceled or postponed over the next eight weeks.

JPMorgan Chase now predicts the U.S. economy will shrink at a 2% annual rate in the current quarter and 3% in the April-June quarter.

The U.S. has seen 64 deaths and more than 2,900 infections. Italy, the worst-hit European country, reported its biggest day-to-day increase in infections 3,590 more cases in a 24-hour period for a total of almost 24,747.

Besides cutting rates, the Fed will buy at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. This amounts to an effort to ease market disruptions that have made it harder for banks and large investors to sell Treasuries as well as to keep longer-term rates borrowing rates down.

The magnitude of the central bank moves indicated to some analysts that Chair Jerome Powell and other members of the Fed were worried about the health of the financial system. But others noted that the Fed was just reacting to signs the situation in Europe and the U.S. was only getting worse.

The Fed's actions were very bold and it does appear to have spooked the markets, said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation at Manulife Investment Management, adding that Fed signaled it was worried about both economic growth and the credit markets.

Markets were going to be spooked anyway due to the scale of the shutdowns across the U.S. and sobering implications of a $20 trillion dollar economy that is about to grind down to a crawl, said Yung-yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.

Also, developments in Europe are raising the prospect that what was just a week ago considered 'worst case' might be closer to 'base case' for the U.S., Ma said.

Big picture, the Fed's actions are all positive.

,"New Zealand's central bank slashed its base rate to a record low of 0.25 percent Monday, but economists said the surprise move was unlikely to prevent a coronavirus-induced recession.

The official cash rate was already at an all-time low of 1.0 percent and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was not scheduled to make a monetary policy statement until March 25.

Instead, it unannounced a 0.75 point cut before markets opened Monday and said the emergency measure would remain in place for at least 12 months.

The bank warned ""the negative impact on the New Zealand economy is, and will continue to be, significant,"" pointing to curtailed global trade, travel and consumer spending.

New Zealand currently has just eight confirmed coronavirus cases and no fatalities, for a population of nearly five million.

The government over the weekend ordered all international arrivals to self isolate in a bid to slow its spread and is due to announce an economic stimulus package on Tuesday.

Market reaction to the rate cut was unenthusiastic, with the benchmark NZX 50 down 2.8 percent at 9,559.10 in early afternoon trade.

BNZ bank head of research Stephen Toplis said the travel restrictions announced over the weekend were a ""game changer"" that locked in a deep recession.

""But it just had to be done,"" he said in a note to clients, estimating the impact on tourism and airports alone would wipe 2.0 percent off gross domestic product.

He warned the first nine months of 2020 could see New Zealand's economy endure ""one of the sharpest drops in living memory"" and there was little the central bank could do about it.

""We don't think lowering interest rates will make any difference to economic outcomes whatsoever in the current environment,"" he said.

""Under the pressure of global financial markets, the bank felt it simply had to move and move big."" Toplis expected Tuesday's government stimulus package to be worth NZ$15.0-20.0 billion ($9.0-12.0 billion).

He said the government balance sheet had the capacity to deliver the huge spending boost but it needed to be carefully targetted for maximum effectiveness in unprecedented circumstances.

""It's time to batten down the hatches. This is going to be a very rough ride,"" he said.

,"Andrew Bailey on Monday takes over the helm at the Bank of England just days after the BoE, under predecessor Mark Carney, slashed its key interest rate to combat the coronavirus.

Bailey steps up from his role as head of the UK's financial regulator where he faced strong criticism over his role overseeing investment scandals in Britain.

Carney is stepping down as governor of the BoE after nearly seven years in the post and having already delayed his departure due to Brexit.

""Although the disruption from COVID-19 could be sharp and large, it should be temporary,"" Bailey said last Wednesday, after participating as an observer in emergency policy meetings that prompted the shock rate reduction.

Bailey spoke sitting alongside Carney at a press conference after the BoE slashed its main interest rate to a record-low 0.25 percent from 0.75 percent -- its biggest cut since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

The reduction headed a package of measures to help UK businesses and households cope with economic disruption arising from COVID-19.

""Bailey certainly could not be taking over at the BoE at a more traumatic time.

It could not be less of a case of being able to ease into the job,"" EY economist Howard Archer told AFP.

His first monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting will be on March 26, where analysts expect further emergency action over the virus fallout.

""We expect the MPC to cut bank rate again to its effective floor of 0.10 percent at its scheduled meeting on March 26,"" noted Pantheon Economics analyst Samuel Tombs.

Earlier this month, Bailey said he had ""no regrets"" over his time at the Financial Conduct Authority.

""I went in with my eyes open... it wasn't a job I applied for, don't regret it for a moment. In terms of public service and public interest -- it's fascinating,"" Bailey told a cross-party panel of lawmakers grilling him on his record at the FCA.

""I will say to anybody who is interested in (taking over at) the FCA, it's fascinating but it's hellishly tough at times, but that's the nature of it,"" Bailey added.

Meanwhile earlier this month, the FCA admitted to a data breach in an embarrassing revelation for the regulator and Bailey.

The regulator said it had mistakenly published the details of around 1,600 consumers who had complained about the regulator, which is tasked with overseeing the conduct of Britain's key financial sector, including any data breaches by banks for example.

Despite the controversy surrounding Bailey, as expected the Treasury Committee backed his appointment by the government.

However the committee's chair Mel Stride, an MP in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative party, expressed ""a number of serious concerns regarding the performance of the FCA both before and during his time as its CEO"".

As for Canada-born Carney, he has been appointed the United Nations' special envoy on climate action and finance.

He repeatedly extended his stay as BoE governor to help oversee Britain's delayed departure from the European Union, which finally took place on January 31.

Carney played a key role reassuring markets in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Democrat Walter Mondale put Geraldine Ferraro on the ticket in 1984, while Sarah Palin was Republican John McCain's pick in 2008, but both lost their elections.

It has been no secret that both Biden and Sanders was seriously considering naming a female vice presidential candidate.

Among Biden's possible choices are Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Amy Klobuchar, both former competitors in the battle for this year's Democratic Party nomination -- or even the progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was briefly a frontrunner in the race.

Prior to her position in the US Senate, the African-American Harris served as the attorney general of California, while Klobuchar is a moderate from the Midwestern state of Minnesota.

Another possible choice is Stacey Abrams, a former state legislator from Georgia who narrowly lost the governor's race there in 2018.

,"China reported 12 more imported cases of the novel coronavirus on Monday as the capital tightened quarantine measures for international arrivals to prevent a new wave of infections.

After declaring they had ""basically"" curbed the spread of the disease within China, where the virus first emerged, authorities are now worried about an influx of infections arriving from other countries.

Beijing's city government has ordered international arrivals from Monday onwards to go into quarantine facilities for 14 days.

Travellers had previously been allowed to undergo the mandatory isolation at home, but now only those with ""special circumstances"" will be exempted from the new rules, and those sent to the facilities must pay for their stay.

Authorities have not given further detail on which travellers will be exempted from the new quarantine.

A total of 123 cases from abroad have now been reported, with four of the 12 latest detected in Beijing.

Imported cases have now outnumbered domestic infections for three straight days.

There were only four new local cases in the country, and all were in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus was first detected in December, according to the National Health Commission.

China has touted the effectiveness of quarantining Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province since late January, along with measures to prevent large gatherings and limit travel across the country.

The death toll now stands at 3,213 after 14 more fatalities were reported on Monday.

China has logged more than 80,800 cases, but most patients have recovered and there are now fewer than 10,000 infected people, according to the National Health Commission.

The country's progress contrasts with the growing crisis abroad, with the worldwide death toll surpassing 6,000 as Italy recorded its biggest one-day rise in fatalities.

With 368 deaths, Italy's grim figure was higher than any single-day toll reported in China.

,"United States' airlines have announced drastic reductions in flights after President Donald Trump's administration banned foreign travellers arriving from Europe.

American Airlines said it would reduce all international capacity by 75 per cent.

""This suspension will last through May 6,"" the carrier said. ""This change is in response to decreased demand and changes to US government travel restrictions due to coronavirus.""



It also said domestic service would be reduced by 20 per cent in April compared to last year.

Its competitor Delta said it would ""significantly reduce its US to Europe flying beginning Monday, March 16, following the US government directive restricting travel between the US and Europe.""



Southwest Airlines said it ""will likely make service reductions based on demand."" The restrictions on travel from Europe took effect at midnight Friday and were later extended to Britain and Ireland as of Tuesday.

US airlines had already suspended flights between the US and Italy, hard-hit by the virus, and earlier between the US and China where the new coronavirus emerged in December.

['Press Trust Of India'],"In a drastic measure to stem any major disruption to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate to almost zero and said it would buy USD700 billion in bonds.

The COVID-19 pandemic has sickened more than 156,000 people worldwide and left more than 5,800 dead. The death toll in the US stands at 68, while infections neared 3,700.

Scientists, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the country are racing against time to find a vaccine to the virus that has spread across the world and is having a major disruptive impact on the economy, particularly in the global supply chain.

The Federal Reserve on Sunday announced slashing the key rate and buying USD700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to help the economy withstand the viral outbreak. ""The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,"" the Fed said in a statement.

Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected, it said, and noted that available economic data showed the US economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.

""The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook,"" the Fed said.

""We have responded very strongly not just with interest rates but also with liquidity measures today,"" Fed Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters at a conference.

US President Donald Trump, who a day earlier was very critical of the Fed, welcomed the move. ""I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve,"" he said. ""People in the market should be very thrilled. ... We got it down to potentially zero,"" the President added.

The Federal Reserve said that it has decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0-0.25 per cent. It expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goal.

""This action will help support economic activity, strong labour market conditions, and inflation returning to the committee's symmetric two percent objective,"" The Fed said.

The Federal Reserve said that it would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including that of public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act appropriately to support the economy.

In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the committee will assess realised and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric two per cent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labour market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments, the Fed said.

It added that to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities that are central to the flow of credit to households and businesses, over the coming months, the committee would increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least USD500 billion and agency mortgage-backed securities by at least USD200 billion.

The committee will also reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.

In addition, the Open Market Desk has recently expanded its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The committee will continue to closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate, the Fed said.

,"Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders sought in Sunday's debate to cast themselves as best-positioned to lead the nation through a global pandemic, with Biden pledging to deploy the military to help with recovery efforts and Sanders using the crisis to pitch his long-sought overhaul of the country's health care system.

One of the reasons that we are unprepared, and have been unprepared, is we don't have a system. We've got thousands of private insurance plans,"" said Sanders, who backs a sweeping government-run health insurance program. That is not a system that is prepared to provide health care to all people in a good year, without the epidemic.

Biden, who is leading Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination, argued that a pandemic was not a moment to attempt to push through an overhaul of the American health insurance system, a politically arduous endeavour.

This is a crisis, Biden said. We're at war with a virus. It has nothing to do with copays or anything.

As the debate opened, Biden and Sanders skipped a handshake, greeting each other instead with an elbow bump. They took their positions at podiums spaced 6 feet apart in keeping with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for limiting the spread of the novel coronavirus. They addressed the nation, and each other, from a television studio in Washington without an in-person audience.

The debate was the first head-to-head faceoff between Biden and Sanders, who are vying to become the Democratic presidential nominee. After a sluggish start to the primary season, Biden rapidly surged to the front of the field, consolidating support among moderates and moving within striking distance of the Democratic nomination. Sanders, a Vermont senator, is struggling to regain momentum and faces the prospect of more losses in Tuesday's next round of primaries.

The coronavirus pandemic dominated the start of the debate, reflecting how quickly it has also overtaken almost every aspect of American life. Schools are shut down across the country, travel has been significantly limited and the likely economic consequences have sent financial markets plummeting.

Biden and Sanders both called for increased testing for the virus and economic relief for Americans who will suffer.

This is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying for one another,"" the former vice president said.

Sanders panned President Donald Trump's uneven handling of the crisis, urging the president to stop hindering medical professionals by blabbering with unfactual information that is confusing the American public.

Czechs are only allowed to go to work and back, go shopping, see their family or a doctor, take care of their animals, buy petrol or spend time in nature, Prime Minister Andrej Babis told a press conference on Sunday.

The measure will apply until 0500 GMT on March 24 in the central European nation of 10.7 million people which has 293 confirmed cases of the novel virus and no deaths.

Babis called on employers to allow staff to work from home whenever possible and asked Czechs to keep a distance of two metres (six feet) from those they meet and use cards instead of cash if possible.

Prague had earlier also announced foreigners would no longer be allowed to cross into the country and Czechs would not be allowed to leave as of Monday.

The government has come under fire this weekend for the shortage of face masks, after it sent a plane with five tons of medical material in aid to China earlier this month.

Health Minister Adam Vojtech said Saturday that doctors were short a million face masks, but the government has since confirmed orders of 1.1 million respirators and five million face masks from China. Private companies have also pledged help.

,"Turkey has quarantined thousands of pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia, officials said, as the country recorded a dozen more coronavirus cases.

The total number of confirmed incidents in over 80 million strong Turkey has reached 18, with 12 new cases -- two related to the first case, seven from Europe and three from the United States, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca announced on Twitter.

""All the passengers returning from pilgrimage as of last night (Saturday) are being placed into separate rooms for quarantine"" in student dorms in the capital Ankara and nearby Konya provinces, the minister said on Sunday.

Approximately 10,000 pilgrims returned from Saudi Arabia Saturday night, youth and sports minister Mehmet Kasapoglu was quoted as saying by the official Anadolu agency.

Koca said one of the pilgrims who returned from the umrah -- the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca -- over the last week had tested positive.

""Those found suspicious are hospitalised as soon as they return and tested,"" he said.

Turkish television showed pilgrims in Ankara wearing protective masks taken in buses to the dormitories.

The umrah, which can be undertaken at any time of year, attracts millions of Muslims from across the globe annually. It remains unclear however how the coronavirus will affect the hajj, due to start in late July.

Saudi Arabia has suspended the year-round ""umrah"" pilgrimage over fears surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.

The kingdom, which hosts millions of pilgrims every year in Islam's holiest cities of Mecca and Medina, has said the move was provisional.

Turkey's religious affairs authority, Diyanet, said the travels for pilgrimage have been halted from February 27.

""The number of cases in Turkey has unfortunately risen to 18 today,"" said Fahrettin Altun, the senior press aide of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey had mobilised all resources to confront this ""unprecedented challenge"", he added.

""We are implementing strong monitoring protocols in our land and sea borders in addition to already strict measures at our airports,"" he tweeted.

As part of its bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, Turkey has applied travel restrictions on a total of 15 countries including France, Italy and Germany.

The interior ministry on Sunday said nightclubs, bars and discotheques would be ""temporarily"" closed from Monday.

Ankara has already ordered schools to close for two weeks from Monday and universities to take a three-week holiday, as well as imposing restrictions on civil servants' foreign travel.

It has ordered sporting events without spectators until the end of April while culture and art events have been postponed.

Erdogan, who has suspended foreign travel, will hold a video conference with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss migrant crisis on Tuesday, rather than a previously announced summit in Istanbul.

,"New York City will close the nation's largest public school system on Monday, sending over 1.1 million children home in hopes of curbing the spread of coronavirus.

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the decision to close schools through at least April 20 and possibly for the school year, following a growing number of school closures in communities and entire states around the country and mounting pressure in New York from residents, City Council members and others.

The mayor called it a very troubling moment, a moment when I'm just distraught at having to take this action, but I became convinced over the course of today that there is no other choice. He also announced that there were now five deaths in New York and that he was ordering the end of elective surgeries.

The shutdown affects the city's nearly 1,900 public schools. Many private schools already have closed.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office had announced the city school closure moments before de Blasio, but initially said it would start as early as Tuesday.

De Blasio had been reluctant to close the school system because of the consequences for students and families. Just Saturday, the Democratic mayor said keeping schools running was critical. He worried that health care workers, first responders and other needed workers would have to stay home to care for children, and that hundreds of thousands of poor students could go hungry without their free or reduced-price school meals.

Multiple states had already announced they were closing schools. So have cities including Los Angeles, Houston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

The shutdown had started to seem inevitable Sunday as de Blasio lost key support to keep schools open and Cuomo called for all downstate schools to be closed.

For New York City, I want to close the New York City public schools, the Democratic governor had said earlier in the day, adding he thought it prudent to do so as soon as a plan was in place to ensure that children of health care workers would be cared for.

Cuomo spoke shortly after county officials shut schools in Long Island and, across the state, in all of Erie County, including Buffalo.

Earlier, George Gresham, president of the healthcare workers union SIEU 1199, had called on de Blasio to close city schools, a step the mayor still seemed reluctant to take when he cited the union's support for keeping the schools open as he spoke on WABC-TV earlier Sunday.

The union had previously warned that hospitals, now bracing for a flood of virus patients, could face a manpower crisis if schools closed suddenly and health care workers had to stay home with their children.

Gresham, though, said in a statement that he was now confident that a plan could be reached to provide childcare for healthcare workers through school resource centers. He also called on the city and state to provide more funding for childcare for health care workers.

With these critical processes moving, I am now calling on Mayor de Blasio to close New York City's public schools to help protect public health and prevent the spread of COVID-19, he said in a statement.

On Sunday morning, Nassau County County Executive Laura Curran announced that schools throughout the county adjacent to New York City would be closed for at least the next two weeks. Nassau County has more than 1.3 million residents.

Later in the day, the Suffolk County executive announced that schools there would be closed as well for the next two weeks. The county executive for Westchester just north of the city said schools would be closed by Wednesday.

President Cyril Ramaphosa made the announcement in a live national television broadcast on Sunday.

""We have decided to establish a national command council and will meet three times a week to coordinate all aspects of this emergency response,"" Ramaphosa said.

The president announced ""social distancing measures"" in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak and said further details will be issued on Monday.

These include a prohibition on gatherings of more than 100 people, cancellation of all large celebrations of national days, including the Human Rights Day on March 21, and the closure of all schools from March 18 until after the Easter weekend.

Visas will be refused to anyone who has visited a high-risk country in the last 20 days, and 35 of the country's 53 land ports will also be shut as of Monday, Ramaphosa said.

The President urged citizens to avoid international travel to high risk countries, but cautioned against any panic.

""We cannot allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by fear and panic. We must stop spreading unverified and fake news,"" he said.

""While we are facing a medical emergency far graver than we have experienced in recent times, we are not helpless. We have the expertise, means and knowledge to fight this disease. We also have partners, various countries and institutions, working with us,"" the President asserted.

""If we act swiftly, we can limit the effects of the disease,"" he added.

Ramaphosa said the Cabinet had decided to take urgent and drastic measures to manage the disease and reduce its impact on the South African society.

""So far SA has 61 confirmed cases, but we are expecting that number to rise. This calls for serious measures. Given the scale and the speed at which the virus is spreading, it is now clear no country is immune or will be spared,"" he said.

""The world is facing a medical emergency, far graver than what we have experienced in over a century,"" Ramaphosa said.

The President said the virus' impact on the South African economy would be huge, especially with the sudden drop in international tourism and severe instability in all global markets.

Steps would be taken to mitigate this, Ramaphosa said.

To date, 61 people in South Africa have tested positive for novel coronavirus -- the second-highest number of cases in Africa after Egypt, which has reported 110 so far.

,"King Felipe VI of Spain moved to distance himself from his scandal-hit father, stripping him of his palace allowance and renouncing what he was due to inherit from him.

A statement from the palace on Sunday announced that he had stripped the former king Juan Carlos, of his allowance and was himself renouncing what he was due to inherit from him.

The announcement came after media reports that Juan Carlos had received 100 million dollars (90 million euros) from Saudi Arabia via an offshore account -- and that King Felipe himself was also a beneficiary.

The money was lodged in a Swiss bank account in the name of a Panamanian foundation.

In the palace statement, the reigning king said that in April he had made it clear to a notary that he would accept no money from the foundation in question.

He also that he had absolutely no knowledge of having been named as a beneficiary to another foundation, which according to press reports paid millions of euros towards his father's flights in private jets.

On Tuesday, the Spanish parliament decided against launching an investigation into suspected money laundering by the former king Juan Carlos.

Spain's hard-left Podemos party had called for it after reports earlier this month that in 2008 Juan Carlos received USD100 million from Saudi king Abdallah via the Swiss account of an entity listed in Panama.

The Swiss daily Tribune de Geneve added that in 2012, USD65 million of that sum was given by the king to his former mistress, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein.

Then a report in Britain's Daily Telegraph said that 52-year-old King Felipe was also a beneficiary of the fund, which it said had been set up when Juan Carlos was still on the throne.

Juan Carlos, now 82, came to the throne after the death of the military dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 and is widely respected for having favoured a transition to democracy.

But he lost his immunity from prosecution after handing power to his son, Felipe, in June 2014 following a 39-year reign.

He resigned from public life last year after a series of scandals about his private life.

In 2012, he outraged Spaniards by going elephant hunting in Botswana at the height of the country's recession.

Spanish reports say Juan Carlos has until now received an annual allowance from the state of more than 194,000 euros.

""We have lost six soldiers in an ambush by Boko Haram terrorists,"" one officer told AFP.

A second source, giving the same toll, said the military convoy had been on its way to the nearby town of Banki when they were targeted by heavy gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades.

Anger has been growing among local residents about the army's failure to stem the attacks.

The military has repeatedly claimed that the insurgency has largely been defeated but attacks against civilians and soldiers continue on a near daily basis.

The conflict has spread to neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, prompting a regional coalition to fight the insurgents.

The jihadists fighting in northeast Nigeria have split into rival groups with one loyal to longtime Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau and another affiliated to the Islamic State group.

,"Portugal will close its border with Spain to tourists for at least a month to curb the spread of coronavirus, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa has said.

Goods and people travelling for work will still be allowed to cross the border but not those on leisure trips, he told a conference on Sunday after speaking by videoconference with his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez.

""There will be no tourism between Portugal and Spain in the coming months,"" he said.

The travel restrictions will apply to both land and air borders and they will come into force once the interior ministers of both nations iron out the details on Monday, Costa said.

They will last until at least Easter, which this year falls on April 12.

""There is a good tradition of Spaniards visiting us during the Easter holidays. This year is not ideal for that visit,"" Costa said.

""As a result, and without any hostility I think it is necessary that during this period there is no tourism activity between Spaniards and Portuguese because we all have to restrict our movements not just within our cities, our countries, but at the global scale.""



With over 7,700 cases and 288 deaths, Spain is Europe's second-most affected country in Europe by the coronavirus outbreak.

Portugal, which is about one-fifth the size of Spain, has so far reported just 245 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus but there are over 2,200 ""suspected"" cases.

Earlier on Sunday, Portuguese Health Minister Marta Temido warned that the number of infections in the country is expected to keep climbing ""at least until the end of April.

,"Spain's royal house has said that King Felipe VI has renounced any future personal inheritance he could receive from his father, King Emerit Juan Carlos I, over the alleged financial irregularities involving the former monarch.

The royal house said in a statement on Sunday that in addition to renouncing his inheritance, Felipe is stripping Juan Carlos of his annual stipend.

The decision comes amid an ongoing investigation by Swiss prosecutors into an offshore account allegedly operated for Juan Carlos. The account allegedly received 88 million euros (USD 100 million) from Saudi Arabia's late King Abdullah in 2008, which prosecutors believes could be kickback payments, according to the Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneva.

On Saturday, British newspaper The Telegraph reported that Felipe was named as a beneficiary of an offshore fund that controls the Swiss account with an alleged 65 million euro gift (USD 72 million) from Saudi Arabia given to his father when he was on the throne.

Felipe denied any knowledge of the fund in Sunday's statement.

,"Cannabis smokers aiming to keep calm and carry on despite coronavirus queued up outside Dutch ""coffee shops"" after the government ordered their closure to beat the outbreak.

Customers lined up in their dozens on Sunday as they tried to beat a deadline for the closure of the marijuana cafes and stockpile weed supplies for what could be weeks of lockdown.

The Netherlands' famed coffee shops have become as much a part of the country's popular image abroad as sex clubs in Amsterdam's famed red light district, which were also ordered to shut by 6:00 pm along with all bars and restaurants.

""For maybe for the next two months we're not able to get some weed so it should be nice to at least have some in the house,"" Jonathan, a Dutch buyer, said outside The Point coffee shop in The Hague.

""My friend called me like five minutes ago, he saw the press conference -- good friend,"" he told AFP.

The queues built up minutes after the Dutch health and education ministers gave a televised press conference announcing the closure of many businesses, along with all Dutch schools.

Similar scenes were reported around the country, with pictures on social media of long queues outside coffee shops in the capital Amsterdam and the historic university city of Utrecht.

Whereas days earlier it was supermarkets besieged with people trying to hoard toilet paper and pasta, the sudden announcement of the coffee shop closure meant there were new priorities.

Staff set up separate lines for cash and cards as customers hurried to order supplies of exotically named strains like ""Doctor"", ""Bubble"" and ""Purple Haze"" before the doors shut.

""I wouldn't mind having a little bit of weed -- keep it easy while we're at home for so long. It might be a long time in quarantine,"" said an Irish woman who gave her name as Hannah as she queued in The Hague.

""I was literally just watching the press conference with my flatmate and then I just went downstairs and suddenly there's this queue of like 30 people, and all these cars arriving as well now.""



Lines also built up at Roermond near the border with Germany, amid fears that the German government would shut its borders with the Netherlands next after introducing strict controls for those arriving from France, Austria, Switzerland, Luxemburg and Denmark from Monday.

Cannabis is technically illegal in the Netherlands, but it decriminalised the possession of less than five grammes (0.18 ounces) of the substance in 1976 under a so-called ""tolerance"" policy.

The cannabis queues came despite Health Minister Bruno Bruins making an ""urgent appeal"" to Dutch people during Sunday's press conference, saying: ""Do not hoard. It is not necessary.""



Prime Minister Mark Rutte will on Monday make a televised address to the nation, which has so far recorded 20 deaths from COVID-19 disease and 1,135 infections.

,"Hard-core supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro ignored coronavirus warnings Sunday to rally in Brazil's biggest cities, accusing Congress and the courts of hindering the far-right leader -- with some openly calling for a coup.

Hundreds of supporters gathered in Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, many wearing face-masks printed with messages such as ""The virus are the scums in Congress.""



Critics condemned the rallies as anti-democratic, in a country still haunted by memories of its military dictatorship (1964-1985) -- whose legacy Bolsonaro, a former army captain, openly admires. But neither that nor warnings



from the authorities to avoid large gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic stopped Bolsonaro's most fervent backers from taking to the streets.

""This is a protest against Congress, because they don't let Bolsonaro govern. They veto everything,"" said demonstrator Rogerio Galhardo, 60, a businessman carrying a Brazilian flag.

""All they want to do is steal,"" added his wife, 45-year-old teacher Patricia Monteiro.

Bolsonaro is locked in a dispute with Congress over 30 billion reals (around USD 6.2 billion) of discretionary spending in the federal budget. Lawmakers have passed legislation to shift the power to decide how and when to spend that money to Congress.

Bolsonaro, who is not affiliated with any political party and has repeatedly sparred with Congress, argues the executive branch should retain that power.

But the dispute has turned into something bigger than just a budget battle, with some Bolsonaro backers openly calling for a new coup.

""The people call on the National Defense Council to stage a constitutional military intervention for 90 days,"" said a banner hanging from one of the four giant sound trucks at the Rio de Janeiro rally.

Bolsonaro had faced criticism for supporting the rallies. Opponents accused him of attacking the country's democratic institutions.

,"French voters cast their ballots Sunday in municipal elections that appear headed for the lowest turnout in decades, after the mounting coronavirus toll saw the government close bars, restaurants and schools and limit long-distance travel.

Anti-infection precautions were in place at the country's 35,000-odd voting stations, with bottles of hand sanitiser at entrances and floors marked with tape to ensure people stay one metre (3.3 feet) from one another.

Several voters turned out sporting surgical masks or disposable gloves and clutching their own pens or bottles of gel.

The streets of Paris -- the main battleground for President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party against Socialist Mayor Anne Hidalgo and right-wing heavyweight Rachida Dati -- were eerily empty, its usually bustling restaurants and cafe terraces shuttered under emergency measures announced hours before polls opened.

France is one of the European countries hit hardest by the virus, with some 4,500 out of 150,000 confirmed global infections and 91 of more than 5,700 deaths worldwide.

Three hours after voting stations opened at 8:00 am (0700 GMT), turnout was just over 18 percent -- nearly five percentage points lower than the previous municipal vote in 2014, government data showed. The capital had a notably low tally at just 12.6 percent. But some voters were unfazed.

""One must vote,"" Bernard Gallis, 66, told AFP upon leaving an otherwise empty polling station in Aulnay-Sous-Bois outside Paris in the morning.

""There is no one here, and the risk is low,"" he said, gesturing towards the balloting station where his wife and six officials seated at tables laden with political party pamphlets were the only other people.

But Gallis said his children, aged 40, 36, and 32, were not planning to vote because of the virus risk.

After casting his ballot in northern France, Macron insisted that ""it is important to vote in these times,"" provided people respect the personal protection measures recommended by scientists.

But many people questioned the wisdom of maintaining the vote for mayors and some half-a-million local councillors, especially if the crisis worsens ahead of the second round of voting next Sunday.

The country has indefinitely closed creches, nursery schools, schools and universities, banned gatherings of more than 100 people, and urged residents to limit their movements in a bid to curtail the spread of the virus.

,"Germany will close its borders with France, Austria and Switzerland from Monday morning due to the coronavirus crisis, a government source told AFP on Sunday, confirming a report in German media.

The popular tabloid Bild had reported that the closures would take effect at 8:00 am (0700 GMT) on Monday, and claimed that goods and cross-border commuters would be exempt.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer met with state premiers from affected German regions on Sunday to agree the closures, the newspaper claimed.

The politicians aimed not only to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but also to curtail cross-border panic-buying, the report added.

Seehofer is set to hold a press conference on the decision later Sunday. Paris, meanwhile, said the decision had been taken in coordination with the French government.

Yet the French interior ministry also insisted that the border would not be fully closed.

""We are going to limit border crossings to the strict minimum, while allowing people and merchandise to go through. It's not a closure,"" a ministry source told AFP.

While the German measures currently only apply to three countries, other neighbouring countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Denmark have also closed their borders or introduced severe restrictions.

Germany had until now resisted closing its borders so as not to endanger the Schengen agreement, which guarantees free travel between European countries and has already been put under strain in recent years by the migrant crisis and the threat of jihadist terrorism.

But with Europe now considered to be the epicentre of the pandemic, calls to close the border with France had begun to emerge shortly before Sunday's decision.

The Islamic State group had claimed responsibility for the attack in the northern district of Panchagarh, but authorities blamed militants from Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).

""The court... sentenced all four to death over the murder. They are JMB members,"" Abdur Rafique, a court official in the capital Dhaka, told AFP.

The priest was a prominent member of Bangladesh's Hindu community, which makes up nearly 10 percent of the South Asian country's population of 168 million.

JMB was blamed for the murders of minorities, secular writers, publishers and foreigners between 2013 and 2016.

Among them was a savage attack at a Dhaka cafe in 2016 that killed 22 people, mostly foreigners.

Seven Islamist extremists were sentenced to death in November over the assault that was claimed by the IS.

The measure could be extended at the end of the initial two week period, she said, and will be accompanied by a USD 23 billion economic stimulus package that will include USD 2.75 billion to shore-up the stock market.

Khater said ""transit flights, cargo flights and Qatari nationals who want to come back to the country"" would be exempted from the new measures. Outbound flights will be unaffected.

Khater also said that all public transport in Doha would be suspended from 1900 GMT on Sunday.

The principal user of Doha's Hamad International Airport is state-run Qatar Airways, which mostly operates the transit flights exempt from the new measures.

Passengers of the airline will still be able to fly between third-country destinations but will be unable to enter Qatar during their transfer.

Visas on arrival had already been suspended for travellers from Italy, France, Spain and Germany as Qatar urged its citizens abroad to return home. Qatari health officials said on Saturday that four patients had made a full recovery after being diagnosed with the virus.

Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen announced the travel ban on Saturday in a desperate effort to limit the spread of the new coronavirus. He said the ban would be effective from Sunday midnight. But the country deferred the travel ban by 12 hours to evade a chaotic situation.

The Wellington Firebirds, currently 26 points ahead of nearest challenger, the Central Stags, will be awarded the 2019-20 title.

""The strong consensus within NZC is that extra measures need to be taken to safeguard both the health and well-being of the New Zealand cricket family and the wider public interest,"" said White.

White said the decision had not been taken under ""mass gathering"" concerns but, rather, under concerns over the heightened risk of transmission in areas such as airports, planes and hotels.

In contrast, advice from both NZC's Chief Medical Officer and the Ministry of Health emphasising the absence of person-to-person transmission in localised environments meant club and amateur cricket could continue to be played.

,"It was on March 16, 2012, when Sachin Tendulkar registered his 100th international ton.

He achieved the feat against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.

Sent in to bat first, India got off to a bad start as the side lost its opener Gautam Gambhir pretty early in the innings.

However, Tendulkar found support in Virat Kohli and the duo formed a 113-run stand. After Kohli's dismissal, Suresh Raina also lent some solidarity to the Indian innings.

Capitalising on Bangladesh's bowling, Tendulkar brought up his 100th ton in the 44th over of the innings.

The Master Blaster went on to play a knock of 114 runs from 147 balls and took India's total to 289/5 in the allotted fifty overs.

However, Bangladesh played a dampener as the side chased down India's total in the final over of the innings to register a victory by five wickets.

Tendulkar had made his debut for India at the age of 16 in 1989.

He aggregated 34,357 runs across formats, which is 6,000 runs more than the second-placed former Sri Lanka cricketer Kumar Sangakkara.

Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen ever, Tendulkar holds the record of being the highest run-scorer of all time in international cricket, having notched up 18,426 runs in ODIs and 15,921 runs in Test matches.

The Master Blaster ended his career with 51 centuries in ODIs, while he had 49 in the longest format of the game.

,"Watching a grueling contest between the bat and ball is every cricket fan's delight, but everyone would agree that watching the batter getting hit on the head is not a pleasing sight to witness.

A good quality bouncer is appreciated by everyone, but as soon as it strikes the batsman on the head, memory echoes back to 2014 as to what happened to Australia's Phil Hughes.

Hughes was struck on the back of the neck by a bouncer while batting for the West End Redbacks in a Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on November 25, 2014, and this resulted in the demise of the cricketer.

So, from there on, even the mighty Australian team has had a changed outlook towards dealing with bouncers.

A similar thing happened during Ashes 2019 when Steve Smith got hit on the head by a ball bowled by Jofra Archer, and immediately the batsman laid down on the pitch, sending the entire Australian cricket team in worry.

Opening batsman David Warner has opened up on recently released documentary of Australian cricket team titled 'The Test' on Amazon Prime Video.

""When I saw him go down, we were all just like not again, not. Please it cannot happen,"" said Warner recalling the incident of Smith getting hit on the head during the second Ashes Test at Lord's Cricket Ground.

Australian cricketers Peter Siddle and Usman Khawaja also shared what it was like to see Smith laying on the ground after being hit.

""I think we were all in shock. I think the worst was when he was laying there. That was probably the scariest moment for us all,"" Siddle said.

""We never thought it would happen. Never thought you could get hit in the head and die from it. And that never crossed my mind, growing up, playing cricket, until it actually happened to Hughesy,"" Khawaja said.

Steve got hit twice on day four of the second Ashes Test match against England-- first on the elbow and then on the neck.

He fell down after the second hit received by the bowling of Archer and was attended by physios from both England and Australia.

Smith had an exceptional Ashes 2019 with the bat as he scored 774 runs, scoring the most number of runs in a series this century.

He is currently the number one batter in the ICC Test batsman rankings.

,"Over the last five years, Ariel India has continuously sparked conversations around the unequal division of domestic chores within households and urging more and more men to #ShareTheLoad.

#ShareTheLoad is not a regular campaign, but a movement for social change. In the spirit of keeping this conversation going and furthering the cause of equality within households, Ariel launched the fourth chapter of ShareTheLoad.

A survey conducted by an independent third-party revealed a startling and uncomfortable truth - 71* per cent women in India sleep less than their husbands due to household chores.

Taking the conversation further from where we left last year, Ariel realized that the impact of men not sharing the load is far deeper and stronger.

Uneven division of household chores like laundry is coming in the way of women getting enough sleep and rest. In fact, in many households, women are the first to wake up and last to sleep.

This time, the conversation is about these unaccounted hours of early mornings and late nights, which are usually spent in wrapping up the chores she couldn't complete during the day!

When men don't share the load, what ends up getting impacted is a basic and everyday phenomenon - sleep!

Lack of sleep is thus almost an indicator, of the inequality within the household.

The new film, launched across social media and digital platforms, seeks to highlight the impact of unequal division of chores on their wife's well-being, and leverage this with men to drive an urgency to act.

Over the last five years, Ariel has been able to impact the thought process for millions of men. From 79 per cent men in 2014 who thought laundry was only a woman's job, the number has steadily declined, being 41 per cent in 2019.

However, even today, only 35 per cent of men contribute daily towards household chores. Ariel has taken the onus to set the bar higher in 2020.

In a survey, most men agree that washing clothes in a machine are the easiest chore for them to start taking over.

Thus, Ariel aims to make laundry the face of this movement against inequality within households by urging men to take the first step to #ShareTheLaundry and eventually, #ShareTheLoad for equal sleep.

After all, with Ariel anyone can get an outstanding clean, no matter who does the laundry!

The film, conceptualised by BBDO, is depicted from the eyes of a little girl devoid of any conditioning, who notices her mom is missing at night while she is asleep and continues to notice her running around doing multiple things, tired and sleepy.

The father's moment of realization is also in a way, driven by the daughter missing her mom at night.

Unequal division of household chores is keeping women awake. #ShareTheLoad - for equal sleep

This inequality within households manifests itself in many more ways for the woman. More than half* the women feel that their children miss out on them due to the burden of household chores these women must carry.

Three out of five women agree that they feel tired during the day. Interestingly, in the same survey, half the women agreed that if they had some free time during the day, they would wish to sleep instead of doing any other activity.

""The film has opened my eyes to a harsh reality. Sleep is a basic need, and if that starts to get impacted, it is a matter of time that health and well-being will take a hit too. When husbands don't do their bit, it impacts their partner's everyday life, which most men don't even realize,"" said Film-maker and author Tahira Kashyap Khurrana, who watched the film.

""I just want to convey to men that if they really love and care for the women in their lives, nothing should stop them from being Equal Partners at home. Ariel is showing an easy way to take that first step, and #ShareTheLaundry to #ShareTheLoad,"" Khurrana added.

""This year, '#ShareTheLoad for equal sleep' seeks to give us one more compelling reason to start sharing the load. Uneven division of household chores is getting in the way of women getting adequate sleep and rest, and hence the conversation this year is about bringing this to light to enable conversation,"" said Sharat Verma, CMO, P & G India and Head, Fabric Care Indian Subcontinent.

""71 per cent of Indian women are sleeping less than their husbands due to these household chores, as they end up waking up early and/or staying up late in order to get everything done. The film is designed to be a mirror into the daily lives of many women, in order to make this unaccounted time count. And with this, Ariel wants to move us all from intent to action by urging them to #ShareTheLaundry and take the first step towards #ShareTheLoad,"" added Sharat Verma.

""How can Ariel as a leading brand truly create change? That was what we wanted to do with this year's campaign for #ShareTheLoad. And hence, by steering the conversation around the impact on the women's wellbeing when their partners don't partake in domestic chores, we want to get men to show solidarity via action,"" said Josy Paul, Chairman and CCO - BBDO India.

""A significant part of the film rests in the early hours or late nights, which is the time that usually goes unaccounted. It is the theatre of the after-hours. It is about making those hours count!"" added Josy Paul.

Ariel India launched the #ShareTheLoad movement in India to address the inequality that exists within Indian households. In 2015, we raised a triggering question 'Is laundry only a woman's job' drawing attention to the uneven distribution of domestic chores.

With 'Dads Share The Load' in 2016, the conversation was aimed at helping to address the root cause - the cycle of prejudice passed down from one generation to the next.

In 2019, we started to drive action, urging parents to raise their sons like they have been raising their daughters, so that the future generation is more equal!

Coursmy is a new tech B2B startup, an AI-enabled learning experience platform.

They provide white labelled learning experience platform, which helps in promoting a strong learning culture, an environment of seamless learning, improved employee engagement and increased functional capabilities.

This is achieved through the democratization of learning process and socialization of learners.

In this platform, up-skilling programs can be offered to employees through various methods. They can sign up for a up-skilling program on the upcoming, new project requirements based upon their preferences or department or supervisor inputs.

The skills of the employees can be matched with the individualised training program that could be provided for the employee and they can undergo training at their own pace through training and learning modules made available online.

Organizations have started to realize that they can save money, time and effort by providing their existing employees with the learning required to take up new roles rather than advertise, interview and hire a fresh hand and then spend money, time and effort at training them for the role.

Up-skilling is beneficial for both the employee and the employer. Employers stand to benefit the most as professionals who undergo up-skilling program will tend to be more loyal and will perform much better at their job.

Employees who are provided with the opportunity to undergo up-skilling programs feel happy and excited to be involved in a learning program that is company-sponsored that will allow them to continue working for the same concern with new skills that will surely improve their pay-check and their horizons.

Coursmy platform essentially supports the organization in driving employee engagement and thus improve productivity and through the democratization of the learning process.

,"Vodafone Idea on Monday paid a further amount of Rs 3,354 crore to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) being the balance part of principal amount towards adjusted gross revenue (AGR) liabilities.

""Thus the company has paid the full principal amount of Rs 6,854 crore towards the AGR dues,"" it said in regulatory filings at stock exchanges.

On March 6, Vodafone Idea had filed its self-assessment of the AGR liabilities with the DoT in which AGR liability principal amount of Rs 6,854 crore was determined for the period from financial years 2006-07 to 2018-19.

The company had earlier paid a sum of Rs 2,500 crore on February 17 and a further sum of Rs 1,000 crore on February 20 towards this liability.

On February 14, the Supreme Court had directed telecom companies to pay the AGR-related liabilities to the government by March 17.

Subsequently, the DoT sent demand notices towards AGR liabilities to telecom operators.

At 12:25 pm, the stock of Vodafone Idea was trading 4.44 per cent higher at Rs 5.88 apiece on BSE Ltd when the S & P Sensex was down by 5.3 per cent.

,"The changing landscape of Mumbai Metropolitan Region has ensured the rise of prime residential hotspots with central suburbs witnessing infrastructure development and emerging as a great investment avenue, according to the latest Knight Frank India Real Estate Report.

Central suburbs witnessed launches of 5,172 residential units in H2 2019, marking a 17 per cent increase year-on-year. ""This is reflective of growing confidence among developers and investors in one of the fastest growing suburbs in Mumbai,"" the report said.

Within central suburbs, Mulund has developed as an ideal destination for those who want to be a part of the city's hustle-bustle, but still want to enjoy a serene living environment. In H2 2019, home prices in Mulund were set in the range of Rs 10,700 to 14,000 per square feet.

Adding favourably to its location advantage, residential projects in Mulund offer amenities like clubhouses, jogging tracks, multipurpose courts and banquet halls which is yet another reason the locality attracts attention from the tenant community.

As compared to the other premium destinations in Mumbai like Ghatkopar or Andheri, the residential market of Mulund remains quite reasonable. Kalpataru will soon launch a premium residential project on the arterial LBS road in Mulund.

Developers like Marathon Group, Wadhwa Group and Piramal Realty have also recently launched projects in the area.

When it comes to real estate investments, Mulund offers a mix of ease of connectivity and premium living. Consequently, the location has been viewed as a preferred choice for several first-time homebuyers as well as those looking to invest in a second property.

What works for Mulund is the existing strong social infrastructure which includes healthcare facilities, education (both secondary and higher), retail, sports and entertainment options.

Thus, unlike an upcoming location, residents of new developments in this area can enjoy all the benefits within their flourishing neighbourhood, said the report.

,"Singapore, Mar 16 (ANI): When Indian-born Anurag Avula and co-founders Lim Yen Ti and Kris Chen left global payments giant PayPal, they were budding entrepreneurs taking a huge leap into the unknown on a personal conviction that they can make a difference in the e-commerce world.

While at PayPal, they realised that smaller retail companies especially in emerging markets were keen to go online and launch digital stores but simply did not have the tools or capabilities. Neither did they have a clue where to start.

Starting Shopmatic was not an overnight decision but something they had thought through based on their collective experience at PayPal. They were confident there was a significant opportunity in this area and were eager to build a sustainable

Avula, CEO of Shopmatic, who spent most of his corporate life working with customers in markets like India, Africa, the Middle East, and Africa, was quite certain that with his and his co-founder's knowledge and experience, they could leverage their capabilities and provide solutions for people in those countries.

Thus, Shopmatic was born in December 2014 in Singapore, with the mission to help millions of small businesses and aspiring e-commerce entrepreneurs overcome the fear of the complexity and the technology required to put their businesses online.

Shopmatic provides a turnkey solution to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) wishing to set-up an online store. This includes setting up the store-front, payment gateway, shipping and logistics, sales management and customer support. Customers can sell through a variety of channels including social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. They also provided customers with the ability to sell across multiple marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, Lazada, Rakuten, Zalora and other local marketplaces.

They decided on India as their launch country. It is not a surprising choice as there are about 50 million SMEs and mom and pop shops that are largely offline and where many of such retailers didn't have the capability nor did they understand e-commerce, tech, and data.

What also validated their decision was the explosive growth in the use of digital platforms and devices in India. Based on Statista, digital payments jumped from about USD 41 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach USD 81 billion in 2020. In the same period, Internet penetration rose from 300 million to 564 million. According to research form techARC, smartphone usage, led by more affordable phones made by Samsung and China's Xiaomi, expanded by 15 percent every year since 2018 and is expected to reach 500 million users in 2020.

On top of this, only one out of five internet users have transacted commerce online. This is a relatively low figure which means there is plenty of room for growth.

Avula revealed on the Jay Kim Show podcast in an interview reported by TechInAsia that they chose to start in India knowing it was a difficult market and if they got India right, the rest of the markets would be a lot easier for them to work in.

After spending a year and a half setting up the company and building the tech backend, the Shopmatic team spent 6 months understanding and exploring the Indian market by visiting over 25 small towns and cities. They finally launched in India in January 2016.

Six months after launching in India, they expanded to Singapore and Hong Kong.

As of last year, the company has raised USD 7.15 million in Series A funding led by ACP, a Singapore-based Venture Capital firm and SPRING Singapore which is a statutory board under Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry. They are in talks to raise another USD30 million in Series B and based on news reports are more than halfway to that mark.

They currently employ over 40 people with offices in 4 cities - Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and India, and claim to have customers in over 13 countries including Sri Lanka, Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, Malaysia, UAE, and Singapore. 85 per cent of customers are from India and 10 per cent from Singapore. As of October 2019, Shopmatic had over 250,000 customers and set to double that by the second quarter of 2020.

In the four years since launch, they have grown revenues from around USD 200,000 to USD 3.7 million. They have reported to be profitable since November 2019.

In February this year, CIMB Bank of Malaysia announced a tie-up with Shopmatic to help Malaysian SMEs build and scale businesses in the e-commerce space. CIMB's SME proposition provides a complete suite of financing and solutions to its customers.

This is after a similarly successful partnership with UOB Bank of Singapore which offers its SME clients a cloud-based digital solution.

""This partnership with Shopmatic aims to help SMEs take advantage of global online business opportunities,"" CIMB Group's CEO of Group Commercial Banking Victor Lee Meng Teck said.

""This further cements CIMB's SME Partners proposition as an ideal and easy-to-use support ecosystem for SMEs just starting out, or those looking to scale-up,"" Victor added.

,"These indeed are peculiar times, which you sometimes have heard from the older generation about our lifestyle, eating habits and especially our buying choices.

Where your mom will still choose to go all the way to the market place physically, surfing through a shop to shop to find that perfect furniture or fresh vegetables, millennials are now taking a turn to their laptops and mobile phones when comes to such purchases.

What can be a possible reason for this?

Authencity is rapidly increasing in the case of online portals. They are no more considered ""shady"" because of being heavily marketed on digital and print media, and even word of mouth. It solves other concerns like:

Easy to research: Because they are promoted online, the mere power of Google can take you to several options, reviews and types for a single item which you wish to buy.

No hassle from a public place POV: People can buy, research, compare and what not by sitting in their car, office, home and even washroom without waiting or sweating in hot weather or queues!

The whole world is your market: You buying capacity is no more confined to your own locality, city or even the country; the whole wild world is now a field for you to choose and buy things from.

The above stated are the reasons why many brands are now switching to either e-commerce websites or mobile applications so that they are more approachable to their consumers and can bank on this changing consumer behaviour.

Even the ones, who don't agree with this trend fundamentally, are switching to it from a perspective.

While upgrading to e-commerce and mobile application, they also are switching to marketing their products as well online through social media marketing as most of the research is done there by the potential client because first, these platforms provide information as well as they visit and update on the same every day.

This is a ground for them to target, influence and target.

But what is even more necessary is choosing an agency which understands the market and current technology. A right agency will help you launch your e-commerce keeping in the new developments both from the technological aspect but also a presentation of it.

""It is a growing market in which brands must invest in for reaping long-lasting results, especially for one launching a product in the market! E-commerce and mobile applications are the need of the hour and they must bank on,"" said Puneet Vig, founder of Doors Studio.

Doors Studio is working intensively in this area providing solutions to such brands while making strategies for their online presence to have a solid standing for deriving more benefits from the same.

They are going full ballistic in providing and educating the brands about the importance of e-commerce and mobile application in the current market.

Any intelligent brand or should keep up in times like these so that they don't become obsolete and grow irrelevant in the market and Doors tries to convey the same to their current and potential clientele. Staying updated with the changing times is a pill they should take consistently for a better future!

,"Amid the spurt in cases of novel coronavirus in different parts of the world, a new study which suggests that the contagious virus does not transmit from pregnant mothers to newborns seems to be bringing some sigh of relief.

Chinese professors report in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics that it doesn't appear that the viral infection is transmittable from pregnant mothers to newborns at birth.

The study is the second out of China within the last month to confirm that mothers infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy did not infect their babies.

All four mothers in the current study, which focused on the of the newborns, gave birth at Wuhan's Union Hospital while infected.

Wuhan in Hubei Province is believed to be the epicenter of the current outbreak that has sickened more than 100,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,400 -- most of them in China.

None of the infants developed any serious symptoms associated with COVID-19 such as fever or cough, though all were initially isolated in neonatal intensive care units and fed formula. Three of the four tested negative for the respiratory infection following a throat swab, while the fourth child's mother declined permission for the test.

One newborn did experience a minor breathing issue for three days that was treated by non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Two babies, including the one with a respiratory problem, did have body rashes that eventually disappeared on their own.

It's impossible to conclude whether there's a connection between these other medical issues and COVID-19.

""We are not sure the rash was due to the mother's COVID-19 infection,"" said lead researcher Dr. Yalan Liu

All four infants remain healthy, and their mothers also fully recovered.

In the previous retrospective study on nine pregnant mothers infected with COVID-19, researchers also found no evidence that the viral infection can pass to the child.

All nine births were done by cesarean section. Three of the four pregnancies in the current study were also brought to term by C-section.

""To avoid infections caused by perinatal and postnatal transmission, our obstetricians think that C-section may be safer,"" Liu said.

""Only one pregnant mother adopted vaginal delivery because of the onset of the labor process. The baby was normal. Maybe vaginal delivery is OK. It needs further study,"" Lu added.

In previous coronavirus outbreaks, scientists found no evidence of viral transmission from mother to child, but SARS and MERS were both associated with ""critical maternal illness, spontaneous abortion, or even maternal death,"" according to Liu.

Globally, an estimated 3.4 percent of reported COVID-19 cases have died, according to the latest data from the World Organization. In comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected.

However, COVID-19 does not appear to spread as easily as influenza. Note that transmission and fatality rates are currently subject to change and revision as more research is done on the virus.

The authors said further investigations into other aspects of potential COVID-19 infection in newborns and children are needed. For example, the sensitivity of the current diagnostic test for detecting the virus is about 71 percent, so they suggest evaluating its reliability in children.

Toward that end, the researchers are collecting additional samples from the newborns, including placenta, amniotic fluid, neonatal blood, and gastric fluid, among others, to detect possible receptors for the virus.

,"A research conducted at the University of Exeter has found that children under the age of seven, who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, will have a different form of the condition compared to those diagnosed at age 13 or above.

Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system in the body attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, destroying them. This means they no longer regulate blood sugar levels effectively and people affected by the condition need to inject insulin several times a day.

The research which was published in Diabetologia - the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), is a first of its kind that studied how children who were diagnosed under 7 years old do not process insulin properly and the cells that make it are quickly destroyed. Surprisingly, those who are older at diagnosis (aged 13 or above) often continue to produce normal insulin.

The Exeter team suggested new names for the two distinct endotypes: Type 1 Diabetes Endotype 1 (T1DE1) for that diagnosed in the youngest children, and for the older at diagnosis it is Type 1 Diabetes Endotype 2 (T1DE2).

Professor Noel Morgan, of the University of Exeter Medical School, said ""We're extremely excited to find evidence that type 1 diabetes is two separate conditions: T1DE1 and T1DE 2. The significance of this could be enormous in helping us to understand what causes the illness, and in unlocking avenues to prevent future generations of children from getting type 1 diabetes. It might also lead to new treatments if we can find ways to reactivate dormant insulin-producing cells in the older age group. This would be a significant step towards the holy grail to find a cure for some people.""

The Exeter team reached their conclusions by analysing two bioresources including the unique Exeter pancreatic biobank comprising more than 130 samples, many of which come from children and young people who died soon after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

The annual rate of inflation, based on monthly Wholesale Price Index (WPI), stood at 2.26% (provisional) for the month of February 2020 (over February 2019) as compared to 3.1% (provisional) reported in January 2020 and 2.93% registered in February 2019.

Derivatives:

The NSE's India VIX, a gauge of market's expectation of volatility over the near term, jumped 11.75% to 57.52. The Nifty February 2020 futures were trading at 9,341.20, a discount of 97.8 points compared with the spot at 9,439.

Prices of industrial metals continued to remain under pressure as countries failed to contain COVID 19 virus which can heighten worries of a slowdown in global economic growth. China is reportedly the largest producer and consumer of industrial metals. Given such a dominant market share any slowdown in the Chinese economy has a major impact on metal prices and global markets.

S. rises and announced to free up as much as $50 billion in financial resources to assist Americans affected by the outbreak. At closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,985 points, or 9.4%, to 26,79.16, while the S&P 500 index 230.38 points, or 9.3%, to 2,711.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 673.07 points, or 9.4%, to 7,874.88. For the week, the Dow was down 10.4%, the S&P 500 index booked an 8.8% decline, while the Nasdaq saw an 8.2% weekly plunge.

The S&P 500 rose more than 9 percent, making Friday its best day since 2008, with most of the gains coming late in the day as government officials and business executives spoke at a news conference at the White House.

President Trump declared a national emergency Friday afternoon, opening up a $50 billion spigot of funding to combat the coronavirus pandemic, while ramping up testing and expanding the ability of hospitals and doctors to provide treatments for the disease.

U.

S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday also said the government would use all its tools to support financing market functioning, while the Federal Reserve said it would ramp up its monthly purchases of Treasury securities, an effort aimed at getting banks to extend credit to businesses and beyond.

The Fed said it would inject $1.5 trillion into the short-term lending markets that banks use to lend to each other on Thursday and Friday.

['Capital Market'],"Trading of Nifty 50 index futures on the Singapore stock exchange indicates that the Nifty could plummet 416 points at the opening bell.

Overseas, Asian stocks were slammed on Monday and the dollar battered after emergency rate cuts in the United States and New Zealand, and a raft of steps by policymakers worldwide failed to stem the rout in markets spooked by the broadening fallout of the coronavirus.

The Federal Reserve on Sunday said it would cut its key interest rate nearly to zero, buy hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds to provide more liquidity to the financial market, ease reserve requirements on banks, and lower the cost of borrowing from the central bank in a series of efforts to ward off the economic dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The announcements, which came as Asian markets prepared to open on Monday, are seen as an indication of the Fed's worry about the economy as COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, leads to widespread disruption. The Fed had previously cut its benchmark federal funds rate by half a percentage point less than two weeks ago. Both rate moves came outside of a scheduled Fed monetary policy meeting.

In US, stocks booked one of their biggest daily gains on Friday after President Trump declared a national emergency to combat the coronavirus epidemic, a day after the Dow and the S&P 500 index suffered their biggest one-day plunge since the October 1987 crash.

The national emergency declaration unleashes $50 billion of funds to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic, but financial market conditions are expected to remain volatile in the wake of this week's global market carnage.

The 39th GST Council met under the Chairmanship of Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The meeting was also attended by Union Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur besides Finance Ministers of States & UTs and seniors officers of the Ministry of Finance.

GST Council took following decisions relating to changes in GST rates on supply of goods and services.

1. The recommendation of the Fitment Committee for calibrating the GST rate structure to correct the inverted duty structure on various items like Mobile phones, Footwear, Textiles and Fertilizers was placed before the GST Council for discussion. The Council had a detailed discussion on the matter. Upon discussion the Council made the following recommendations:-

To raise the GST rate on Mobile Phones and specified parts presently attracting 12% to 18%.

To deliberate the issue of calibrating the rate in other items for removing inversion in future meetings with further consultation and examination of issue.

2. GST rate on all types of matches (Handmade and other than Handmade) has been rationalised to 12% (from 5% on Handmade matches and 18% on other matches). This would address the classification issues. This issue was deliberated earlier in the 37th meeting and was pending for decision.

3. To reduce GST rate on Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services in respect of aircraft from 18% to 5% with full ITC and to change the place of supply for B2B MRO services to the location of recipient. This change is likely to assist in setting up of MRO services in India. Domestic MRO will also get protection due to 5% tax paid under section 3(7) of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 on most imported goods (sent abroad for repairs) as this tax is not available as credit.

,"Pakistan has done it again. It's Prime Minister Imran Khan chose for SAARC video conference on the coronavirus pandemic the man who smuggled out 20 million face masks to foreign countries.

Zafar Mirza, Pakistan's representative to the SAARC video conference on the coronavirus on Sunday, is being probed by his country's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his involvement in the smuggling.

As per a notification issued by the agency, FIA's director of Islamabad Zone has been directed to immediately investigate the allegations against Mirza -- who is the Special Assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on Health -- and submit a report within 15 days on the same.

The complaint, filed by a representative of the Pakistan Young Pharmacists Association (PYPA), Dr Furqan Ibrahim, alleges that 20 million face masks were smuggled out of Pakistan with the help of Mirza and Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP), as per a report by Dawn.

The development has come at a time when the is facing a huge shortage of masks amid the outbreak of COVID-19 -- a pandemic which has claimed the lives of more than 6000 people globally.

Notably, even as Mirza is being probed for the alleged smuggling of masks, Islamabad decided to send him as its representative for a video conference convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with leaders of all other SAARC nations in attendance.

In his address at the conference -- convened with an aim to chalk out a strategy to fight novel coronavirus --, Mirza raked up the Kashmir issue, saying that it is imperative that the lockdown in the region be lifted in view of the health emergency amid coronavirus outbreak.

""It is a matter of concern that COVID-19 has been reported from Jammu and Kashmir. In view of the health emergency, it is imperative that all lockdown in the territory must be lifted immediately,"" Zafar Mirza, Pakistan's State Minister of Health, said at a video conference with leaders of the SAARC nations on COVID-19.

""Opening up communications and movement will facilitate the dissemination of information, allow distribution of medical supplies, and enable containment and relief efforts to proceed unimpeded,"" he said.

,"China has said it has no intention to participate in the trilateral arms control negotiations with the United States and Russia, stating its nuclear force is always kept at the minimum level ""with an order of magnitude difference"" from that of the other two countries.

Last year, the US had listed two reasons for its withdrawal from 1987's Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty -- Russia breaking of it by developing new weapon classes, and China not being covered by its scope. While the USA would like to arrange a new tripartite agreement covering the possession of nuclear weapons, China is having none of it.

Indeed, the USA warns of a nuclear arms race as Russia and China introduce new missiles and increase their strategic nuclear inventories. When the INF Treaty was implemented in 1987, the was a very different place. Since then, China's missile arsenal and capability have advanced in leaps and bounds.

James H Anderson, acting Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Policy at the Department of Defense, said before a US House Armed Services Committee hearing in late February that China will ""at least double"" the size of its nuclear weapon arsenal in the next ten years. One way of achieving this is through the use of multiple warheads on missiles like the DF-41.

Anderson spoke of China's ""most rapid expansion and diversification of its nuclear arsenal in its history"". He added: ""China's nuclear forces include a mix of strategic-range systems capable of striking the US homeland as well as theater-range forces capable of threatening allies and partners, US bases and forces in the Indo-Pacific region.""

The USA thus believes it is ""imperative to address"" Russian and Chinese proliferation and buildup of new weapon types. Hence, President Donald Trump is proposing a bold trilateral arms control initiative, an extension of the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement signed with Moscow in 2010.

It limits the USA and Russia to 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads, but the treaty will expire on 5 February 2021 unless mutually renewed.On 9 March in Washington DC, the State Department gave a special briefing on the possibility of extending New START. A senior spokesperson said next-generation arms control must ""go beyond just the traditional bilateral context that we all became used to during the Cold War, and that it covers not only more parties than before, specifically bringing in China as well as Russia, but also that it cover more systems than is currently covered by New START"".The official continued: ""Bringing China into the mix is critical here as well. China has enjoyed having both Moscow and Washington constrained by strategic arms control, and it is on track to at least double the size of its arsenal over the next few years. That is not just a question of numbers, although its numbers are increasing quite notably, but it's also a question of the range and diversity of delivery systems, and a range of systems that are both - that are capable both of nuclear delivery and non-nuclear delivery.""Beijing has a very different perspective, however.Zhao Lijian, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, stridently stated, ""China has repeatedly reiterated that it has no intention of participating in the so-called trilateral arms control negotiations with the US and Russia ... It is well known that China follows a defense policy that is defensive in nature. Our nuclear force is always kept at the minimum level required by national security, with an order of magnitude difference from that of the US and Russia.""The Washington-based Arms Control Association estimates that Russia has 6,490 stockpiled nuclear weapons, the USA 6,185, France 300, China 290, the UK 200, Pakistan 160, India 140, Israel 90 and North Korea 30.China evades such invitations to talks, even while it is making a major push to introduce new missile types like the DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile, and DF-31AG and DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). China's DF-17 hypersonic missile is also said by some to be capable of carrying a nuclear device.The People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) is not seeking parity with the USA or Russia in terms of nuclear weapon numbers. Nonetheless, the quantity of the missiles that the PLA showed at its 1 October 2019 parade exceeded foreign estimates, leading to suggestions that China's arsenal may already be considerably larger than what is generally accepted.Zhao added, ""China will continue to work with all parties to strengthen communication and coordination within such frameworks as the mechanism of five nuclear-weapon states [China, France, Russia, UK, and USA], and discuss a wide range of issues concerning global strategic stability"".China has indicated it will encourage multilateral, but not bilateral or trilateral, agreements. One example is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which this year marks 50 years and has 190 member nations. Beijing's official line is that it is not against nuclear disarmament in principle.Reinforcing this message, the online English version of the PLA Daily said, ""China's attitude is very clear: China's nuclear force is always kept at the minimum. It is neither fair nor reasonable for China to participate in the arms control negotiations between the US and Russia.""How is the USA trying to engage China? The US State Department invited China on 19 December to conduct a strategic security dialogue, which would include the nuclear arms issue, but it is ""yet formally to respond to us at all"".It is ramping up pressure on Beijing. The American official said, ""I think we can all perhaps help make that more likely, rather than less likely, by drawing attention to the fact that they are simultaneously building up their nuclear arsenal and refusing to talk about how to rein in the threats that that creates through arms control.""Increasing tensions between China and the USA are viewed as a further reason why the two sides should talk about nuclear arsenals. ""They place great stock in how the rest of the views them as a responsible power and a great power, and I would encourage them to behave as great powers do and as we and the Russians are already modeling by sitting down and talking together about these sorts of things,"" the US representative noted.

However, China is adamant it will not join such negotiations. This by itself will have a constraining effect on Russian-American arms controls. The US State Department warned: ""If a serious answer is to be found to these range of issues, I would argue that all three need to be in the mix somehow, because what each party will think it needs to do vis-a-vis the excluded party will constrain what they can agree to as between themselves.""Beijing's line is that the USA and Russia should reduce their nuclear inventories first. Then, Zhao said, ""This will create conditions for other nuclear-weapon states to join multilateral disarmament talks.""China is concerned about not just American stockpiles. There is mistrust between Beijing and Moscow, causing them to have on-site inspection arrangements of a sort, and missile launch notification agreements. The US official observed, ""And what that signals to me is both that they see some reason to be concerned about each other's arsenals...but also that it's not at all impossible to engage China in transparency and confidence-building measures, which is a part of the arms control undertaking.""China also has an eye on India, which is strengthening its nuclear deterrence with elements such as ballistic missile submarines.A PLA Daily commentary said the Chinese military presently has enough nuclear weapons to prevent ""bullying"", but it still requires certain capabilities to improve deterrence. The article said, ""To enhance China's strategic counterbalance in the region and maintain China's status as a great power and protect national security, China has to beef up and develop a reliable nuclear deterrence capability.""Intent on increasing warheads to improve its second-strike survivability, China claims to be a responsible nuclear power. For instance, it insists it will adhere to a ""No First Use"" policy whereby it would never be the first party to launch nuclear weapons. Yet, China has a poor record on nuclear proliferation. For example, it helped Pakistan with ring magnets for centrifuges and warhead design data in the 1980s. Pakistan later spread nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Syria.Furthermore, North Korea's large transport-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicles for ICBMs were also built in China. There is little evidence that China has fully rolled back support for North Korea's missile program.Asia's nuclear order - encompassing China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea - does not rely on treaties, regulations, and verifications, but rather self-restraint (albeit, North Korea's lack of self-discipline resulted in international sanctions).Rod Lyon, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), wrote: ""China is a good example of that Asian model of nuclear order - hence its small nuclear arsenal, few nuclear tests, no-first-use commitment, tolerance of large numerical asymmetries vis-a-vis its possible nuclear rivals, and slow development of its nuclear triad. In a manner characteristic of that Asian order, Chinese nuclear weapons sit in the strategic background rather than the foreground.""Lyon's assessment continued: ""What we're witnessing, then, is the collision of two separate and distinct models of nuclear restraint: on one hand, what we might call the 'Euro-litigious' model; on the other, the model of voluntary self-restraint. China may have few runs on the board in relation to the first model, but it has plenty in relation to the second.""

Lyon gave two possible reasons why China might eventually join negotiations: process and outcome. By process, he meant that China would benefit from sitting around the table with Russia and the USA, cementing its place as a nuclear peer. However, this approach would undermine China's position that it is already a responsible nuclear power.

As for outcomes, Lyon said any future agreement would shape China's arsenal. However, treaties such as START were generally about capping numbers of long-range nuclear missiles, a class that China does not have many of to start with. Would its stocks be capped at a lower limit than Russia or America, for example? Beijing would hardly accept that, and China would view this as containment codified within a formal treaty.

The regulatory issue becomes stickier when different weapon classes are considered. China has asymmetric strengths such as short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. The ASPI academic mused too: ""China and Russia would, I think, be reluctant to sign an agreement legitimizing deployment of US intermediate-range systems which could target their homelands, when their own intermediate-range systems can't reach the continental US.""

Yet another serious issue, one that would seem intractable, is that a trilateral nuclear arms agreement would require verification via on-site inspections. It is inconceivable the PLARF would allow foreign observers into its secretive several-thousand-mile network of tunnels housing TELs, missiles, equipment, and production facilities. China would never permit foreigners running amok in this way.

Lyon added that ""China has not traditionally relied much upon nuclear weapons to coerce other players. Its conventional and paramilitary forces are well placed to serve in that mission. And, of course, Beijing is happy to 'weaponize' economic ties and Chinese indigenous communities when it needs to.

In short, it already has such a range of coercive levers close to hand that an expanding nuclear arsenal - in and of itself, regardless of final size - would suggest a less self-restrained Beijing in future.""There is already a strategic competition. The USA, responding to China and Russia, will speed up the development and deployment of new weapons such as low-yield nuclear weapons, plus it is developing the B-21 Raider long-range stealth strategic bomber.China has successfully avoided arms control in the past, and it will continue to do so. It is in Beijing's best interests not to limit itself voluntarily, so the USA will have to dig in for the long haul if it wants even a modicum of progress in drawing China into negotiations.The USA's comment that it is ""cautiously optimistic"" that it can move towards trilateral engagement ""in the very near future"" seems a mere pipe dream, given the murmurings already emerging from Beijing.

['Nikita Vashisht'],"Interest rate cuts have become the go-to tool whenever a country finds itself in the midst of a market-related instability or an The recent (Covid-19) outbreak, too, has led to a clamour for a rate-cut to support the sentiment.

Understandably so, the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), in a surprise move, cut its key interest rate to a target range of 0 per cent and 0.25 per cent on Sunday. The cut comes close on the heels of a rate cut done on March 3. Bank of England, last week, too, cut its in an emergency move to bolster the economy, as did central banks of Australia and New Zealand on Monday.

Despite this, the US stock futures were locked in their lower limit on Sunday (Monday for India), after entering into a bear phase (down 20 per cent from the top) last week.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to hold a media interaction later in the day today. It is widely expected that the central bank will cut rates and announce measures to boost sentiment.

So, is the monetary action not enough? Maybe, say analysts.

According to JP Morgan, interest rate cuts may not assuage investors who are dealing with twin shocks of a slump in prices and the outbreak of Covid-19, leading to a sharp repricing in global markets, including in equities, fixed income, commodities and currencies.

“More than interest rate cut, the most important role for central banks to play is to ensure that liquidity remains ample. While investors have gotten addicted to monetary policy responses during this cycle, the more important reaction is actually from fiscal policy,” the brokerage notes.

Apart from the first order impact of the virus, JP Morgan cautions the governments across the globe, about the need to prevent second-order effects, especially from “social distancing”, such as job losses and bankruptcies.

“This would include several microeconomic measures that can provide support to affected small and medium businesses and their workers. This would help to soften the short-term negative impacts of Covid-19 and would help to strengthen the eventual rebound. It is crucial for people to have jobs to return to and businesses to go back to when life goes back to normal,” it underlines.

Devendra Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research, too, calls for a mixed action-plan - a combination of rate cuts and fiscal boost.

“We need monetary action, right now, to ensure that businesses – whose cash flows or working capital have been hit due to lack of demand in the wake of the virus outbreak -- don’t suffer when the economy crawls back to normalcy, and they don’t default on their loans,” he explains.

unmoved - for now

Despite global central banks cutting interest rates, the RBI, so far, has adopted a cautious approach. While there were no rate cuts till Monday, the central bank undertook currency swap operation of $2 billion to safeguard the rupee’s value against the US dollar.

“Going ahead, we expect the to buy $18 billion of forex forward to contain bond yields to make room for open market operation (OMO) ” say analysts at BofAML.

“What India needs is a mix of monetary and fiscal boost… While a rate cut may still be given, government doesn’t have the space to provide fiscal stimulus,” Pant of India Ratings says, adding that the provided now would have to be prudently reversed when the is curtailed.

The fall in price, therefore, can be a blessing for India in this case. According to estimates by BofAML, the fall in prices could lead to a potential boost of Rs 500 billion or 0.4 per cent of GDP to consumption, after the Rs 3 excise duty hike, is passed on to the consumer.

A boost in public spending through say, higher interest rate subsidies on mortgage or SME loans to support consumption demand, are some of the ways through which Centre could provide stimulus.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/will-the-rbi-cut-rates-today-fiscal-boost-also-needed-to-battle-slowdown-120031600477_1.html,Business Standard,Markets,TRUE

Only those shareholders, who have less than 100 shares in the bank, can sell their entire shareholding.

Moreover, YES Bank also declared its corporate results for the quarter December 2019 (Q3FY20) during the weekend in which it reported net loss of Rs 18,560 crore for the quarter. Net interest income declined 60 per cent year-on-year at Rs 1,065 crore, which was significantly impacted by elevated slippages.

Asset quality deteriorated with corporate gross non-performing lending (GNPL) rising to 30 per cent and SMA & investment stress book (not recognized) at Rs 17,500 crore at 8 per cent of loans. The management hopes to contain slippages for FY21 less than 5 per cent.

The management said the Bank’s near term focus will be on deposit mobilization, retail loans including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), cost optimization and acceleration in resolution of stressed assets.

“We, however, believe that the probability of overshooting the target remains high and despite non-performing loans and advances (NPL) coverage ratio of 73 per cent, credit cost could stay elevated and weak operating metrics could keep losses continuing and even if the bank turns profitable it would remain sub-optimal for the next couple of years. Key for the bank would be to restore depositors' faith,” analysts at Antique Stock Broking said in result review.

Asset quality numbers look catastrophic. Higher provisions also resulted in violation of RBI capital adequacy norms. With slippages’ guidance of 5 per cent until FY21, any respite in credit cost, and thereby profitability, is unlikely in the near term, analysts at Elara Capital said in quarterly update.

['Vaibhav Sanghavi'],"2020 has been a year of unprecedented volatility, starting from the problems in West Asia led by Iran, following up with China Coronavirus, Union Budget, breaking of OPEC-controlled oil prices and the subsequent spread of virus from China to other countries, leading to a World Health Organisation (WHO) declared pandemic. The effect of all these events has led to a massive dent in sentiment and global have corrected sharply.

From a global perspective, there is an expectation that economic growth will take a big hit, as countries lock down to control the spread of the virus. Global equity are thus correcting anticipating prolonged crisis.

Various Governments, and their respective central banks, have come in with fiscal and monetary measures to ease the pain of demand shock in the short-term. While volatility has risen to 2008 levels, we have to be careful to compare the current situation to 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). In my view both the events are very different and not comparable. Once the fresh new infection cases plateau, like we witnessed In China, normalcy should resume. In addition to the virus, oil prices has also seen a sharp correction. Failure to arrive at production cut targets among OPEC has added to global risk-off.

What we've read or seen about the pandemic, it is expected to stabilise within few months as a concerted effort is put together to curb the spread. Meanwhile, while this is likely to have a short-term impact, this should not structurally change the dynamics of an economy, making this a temporary phenomenon. In the interim, the fear factor is likely to be at its peak. The effect of co-ordinated monetary and fiscal easing leading to demand incentivisation and liquidity will show its full effect on the economy and once this short-term fear abates.

The Indian government, too, has been proactive and have initiated various measures to control the spread of virus. That said, there have been some encouraging green shoots on economic data over the last few months - viz. better index of industrial production (IIP) and Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) numbers. Lower crude prices may lead to lower inflation, and looking at our high real interest rates, there is a scope of a sizeable rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Indian economy per se is in a sweet spot, wherein we are largely dependent on domestic consumption and have relatively lesser global influence.

From an equity market perspective, we have always been complaining of relative higher valuations. After current market correction, valuations have become attractive and provide a great entry point for a long-term investor. Hence, the current problem that looks to be temporary, isn't changing the longer-term structural economic growth opportunity. Strong businesses will bounce back equally sharply post the stabilisation of pandemic.

Investors should look through the shorter-term pain and as the longer-term investment opportunity looks very attractive. That said, the short-term volatility would continue to remain elevated and investors need to manage risk. It is generally said that return is a factor of risk you take, and maybe this is a time where we should take risks to benefit from the potential of earning better returns from equities in the long term.

Prices rose initially due to the surprise Fed rate cut, said CMC analyst Margaret Yang Yan, adding that: ""The market is very indecisive and there are divergent opinions. Investors are now dumping everything. They just want cash.""

The Fed slashed rates back to near zero, restarted bond buying and joined with other central banks to help put a floor under a rapidly disintegrating global economy amid the escalating coronavirus pandemic. The Fed's rate cuts and restarting of quantitative easing are positives for gold, but ""we're in an unconventional time and theory might not apply in a time of high volatility and divergence"", Yan said.

The dollar fell from a more than two-week high and stock plunged after the Fed cut rates for the second time this year to soften the economic blow from the economic shock.

Apart from reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, lower interest rates weigh on the dollar, making greenback-denominated gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies. The benchmark US 10-year Treasury yields fell, resuming its march towards an all-time low touched last week, while the safe-haven yen rose from a two-week low against the dollar.

['Gaurav Garg'],"Market bounced from its lower circuit; likely to face sharp volatility ahead



Market traded with volatility on Friday as it opened with negative sentiments and hit 10 percent lower circuit within a few minutes after opening, but it also recovered quite smartly from the lows of 8,555 and closed on a positive note. Rupee further weakened and closed at 74.0250. With volatile global markets, Indian indices too faced sharp recovery from intraday low. Nifty closed at 9,955.20 adding 365 points. PSU banks, metal stocks traded with positive sentiments whereas media stocks traded with red mark. Nifty bank closed at 25,166.45 adding 1,195.30 points from the previous day’s closing.



As per weekly option data, handful of call unwinding on higher strikes ranging from 10,000 to 10,300 can be seen which shows Nifty is losing its resistance in sub 10,200 zone. 10,500 will act as resistance as maximum OI for the calls is placed here after 11,000 strike. We can witness short-covering move along with addition of fresh position only if Nifty breaches 10,000. Therefore, traders should try to create long keeping close eye on 10,000 as it will act as a make or break level.



We can see a big momentum in following stocks:



Buy: Indian Oil Corporation Limited (Above Rs 93.40)



Target: Rs 102



Stop loss: Rs 88



Stock is forming a reversal pattern on daily charts along with forming long pin bar candlestick. Stock is showing sign of oversold on RSI indicator. Breakout from the level of 93.40 would lead stock to witness more upward movement.

Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we recommend buying the stock above 93.40 for the target of Rs 102, keeping a stop loss at Rs 88 on closing basis.



Buy: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (Above Rs 202)



Target: Rs 212



Stop loss: Rs 196



Stock is forming a reversal pattern on daily charts along with forming inverted hammer candlestick. It is also showing positive divergence on RSI indicator. Breakout from 202 would lead stock to witness more upward movement.

['Devarsh Vakil'],"Have bottomed out? The honest answer is that we can’t say for sure. That a bottom or a top has been made can only be ascertained only after a considerable period of time has elapsed post the event.

Now, if the question is – “can stocks be bought now?” –it then is relatively simpler to answer.

While it is customary for experts to advice buying on dips, the answer is actually more nuanced. When market falls, it may mean different things to different people. For someone who is sitting on cash it comes as a rare buying opportunity. For an investor who is fully invested, these are trying times and those who have leveraged in futures, ground could be slipping under their feet.

Strategies for long term -“Buy & Hold” Investors.

If you are a ‘Buy and Hold’ type long-term investor, near-term uncertainty should not come in your way of nibbling at stocks. If you have a horizon of, say three years, and are willing to bear the short-term pain, than this market is for you.

For long-term investors who are picking up stocks on their own and directly – it is more important to decide ‘what’ to buy than ‘when’ to buy. Even if you are completely convinced that the index has reached nadir and it is headed higher, it does not mean that you will make money if you happen to choose the wrong stock. In a slower economic growth environment, many weak and marginal companies will not survive. If you happen to get into a right company at a wrong price, be ready to hold on for a really long term for a profitable exit.

The Nifty is multiple times of what it was at the lows of 2,250 – the level it was at in 2008. If you compare the stock prices prevalent then and now, you will find complete contrast in their performances. There are around hundred companies who stock prices have multiplied many-fold and have generated tremendous wealth for their owners. At the same time, there are scores of companies who have folded-up. There are 302, or around 30% of the top 1,000 companies, which survived and still trade on the exchanges. Albeit, their stocks prices are mere fraction of their lowest prices back in 2008.

If you were brave enough to pull the trigger at the right price at the right time, do not be greedy. If you think the volatility and uncertainty will end soon, you are sadly mistaken. Keep booking profits when you make extraordinary gains in short period of time. Get back again if the stock prices dips again.

How to choose the right stock?

There will be some stocks in all sectors that will do well. For a stock price to appreciate, it needs earnings growth and reasonable valuations. Do check and avoid stocks with problems of high debt, promoter pledging or corporate governance. Just avoid these pitfalls and you will do reasonable well.

If you buy high quality business that has growth potential, then do not bother about short-term stock price fluctuations. These stocks will eventually rise as and when the tide turns. What is important is the underlying quality of the business remains intact and company remains on the growth track.

How to determine the quality of the underlying business of the company?

Businesses that can deliver growth without taking in more capital is a good company. If quality of growth is reasonable in terms of incremental returns on capital, then it will add to per share value for stockholders over the long term.

So, if non-financial company requires high amount of capital to expand the business, than it is not very attractive business. Capital can be raised by issuing new shares or taking bigger loans – both are very dangerous for the longer term prospects. So, avoid companies that keep doing frequent rights issues, qualified institutional placements (QIPs), or keep issuing high amount of debt.

Another strategies investors can adopt is to buy high dividend yield stocks. Do not buy the stock just because you calculate high yield based on historic dividends and current low prices. Many companies will not be able to repeat their dividend and the current fall in their stocks prices are rightly discounting their deteriorated fundamental prospects. So, a thorough due diligence before taking a plunge in these or similar stocks may be in order.

Strategies for traders

In a market that shoots first and asks questions later, decisions have to be taken at the spur of the moment. It's pretty easy to preach after the event has happened. On March 13, 2020, the Nifty hit 10 per cent lower circuit in just 7 minutes after opening. Many stocks fell like nine pins.

Risk management is very important to stay in the game for traders. Ability to book a loss separates the traders who escape with minor bruises and those that get really butchered. Reduce the size of the bets to minimise the changes of large losses. Your immediate concern should be to protect capital. At the same time, if you have the spare capital and risk appetite, it is also important to summon the courage and put money at risk in such chaotic times. There are some days that offer extraordinary opportunities to brave hearts. A quick analysis of the price movement on March 13, 2020 reveals that the top 500 stocks that are traded daily closed 20 per cent higher on average from their low price of the same day. There are score of examples of the well-known, blue chip companies whose share prices have risen by 50% from the manic lows seen earlier in the day.

We are passing through unconventionally volatile times and witnessing history being made right in front of our eyes. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary strategies. Choose well. Whatever you chose to do next, I hope it is profitable!

Trade with Malaysia and Turkey were also hit due to their anti-India stand on abrogation of Article 370 and 35A in Jammu & Kashmir, following India’s strong condemnation to their comments and trade restrictions thereafter.

“There have been absolutely no orders since coronavirus outbreak in China. Tonnes of exported buffalo meat await clearances at various ports. Receivables worth millions of dollars are still pending due to lockdown abroad. We are trying to convince the local authorities at importing countries to clear the consignments and deposit goods in cold storages there,” said Soeb Khan, managing partner, Fresh N Frozen Tech, a Hyderabad-based manufacturer and merchant of buffalo meat.

The delay in clearing consignments at foreign ports has resulted in massive demurrage being paid over and above container and freight charges.

“Additional payment of demurrage is causing a huge burden on buffalo meat exporters,” said Khan.

In quantity term, however, the decline was a mere 2.4 per cent to 1 million tonnes for the period between April 2019 and January 2020 as against 1.03 million tonnes reported in the comparable period last year.

Of this, Vietnam alone contributes 36 per cent, followed by Malaysia (10.7 per cent) and Turkey (10.4 per cent). Trade sources believe that consignments meant for exports to Hong Kong and Vietnam are forwarded to China for consumption there.

“There is no respite for India’s buffalo meat exporters in the visible future due to widening spread of coronavirus,” said Qureshi Shakir Hussain, Director, Al-Quresh Exports, a city-based manufacturer and merchant of buffalo meat.

Meanwhile, exporters fear buffalo stocks have been piling up in slaughterhouses. Weak demand from overseas has resulted into a sharp fall in realisation.

Hussain said buffalo meat demand would rise once this transition period gets over, and would revive overall sentiment possibly within three months.

The Nifty plunged 10 per cent in opening session, leading to a trading halt for the first time in 12 years. During the hour-long trading break, US equity futures and the Asian saw a dramatic recovery underpinned by central bank measures, which helped repair investor sentiment bruised by stocks plunging to multi-year lows.

After dropping to 8,555, the Nifty managed to end the day at 9,955, up 365 points, or 3.81 per cent, over the previous day’s close — and 16.4 per cent over the day’s low. The Sensex, after slipping to 29,389, staged a 4,700-point come back to end at 34,103.

The sharply-lower opening in the domestic market, as well as in other Asian markets, came in the wake of a 10 per cent plunge — the worst since 1987— in the Dow Jones index of the US.

Throughout the day, stocks exhibited wild swings, with many gyrating in a 30 per cent band. A day earlier, the Nifty had ended at a 33-month low, pushing the domestic into “bear territory”.

To stem the rout, Asian central banks announced aggressive measures. The People’s Bank of China decided to inject $79 billion into the economy through a reduction in reserve ratios. The Bank of Japan offered to provide $20.8-billion liquidity, while the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Korea took steps to iron out currency fluctuations. Lawmakers in the US were also expected to unveil a legislative package to address the economic fallout.

The US Federal Reserve promised to start purchasing a range of treasuries -- a step that effectively marks a return to the 2008 crisis-era bond-buying programme known as quantitative easing.

The sharp recovery in the markets was on optimism around stimulus measures announced by various central banks, said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services.

""After another sharp fall, some had to sell desperately to honour margin commitments. Following the early morning rout, huge value emerged in several stocks,” said U R Bhat, director, Dalton Capital India.

Apart from the stimulus packages, analysts said “short-covering” contributed to the dramatic recovery. Market players said the markets were not yet out of the woods as COVID-19 (disease caused by coronavirus) cases across the globe continued to rise.

Also, the selling by overseas investors showed no signs of easing. On Friday, overseas investors sold shares worth over Rs 6,000 crore, extending their 14-day sell-off to Rs 43,000 crore. After the latest jump, the Sensex and the Nifty are down 17 per cent from their all-time highs, logged in January. Sanjay Mookim, India Equity Strategist, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted while the market valuations had slipped below historical levels, further slide could not be ruled out.

""Sentiment around COVID-19 is driving global equities. Several large economies still need to contain the virus. This may require more drastic lockdowns and economic checks. That could drive a market to undershoot,"" he said.

Mookim said despite the sharp correction, ""we have still not reached the 'Kid-in-Toy-Shop' moment"". ""Quality, steady-growth stocks are still far from being cheap,"" he noted. Analysts said it remained to be seen if emergency fiscal and monetary packages would be enough to avert a global recession.

There are tell-tale signs that the may have intervened in offshore markets,” said the currency dealer.

Abhishek Goenka, managing director at IFA Global, said the RBI heavily sold dollars even when there was huge risk aversion. And so, “as the risk on sentiment came back, the rupee benefitted”.

According to Goenka, the fall in the crude oil prices has managed to protect the rupee, otherwise the currency could have reached 77 a The RBI, it seems, would want to protect the rupee’s lifetime closing lows of 74.48 a dollar it reached in October 2018.

The RBI doesn’t put out direct data on its domestic intervention, but the data on dollar purchase and sales comes with a two-month lag. However, currency dealers get to know any central bank intervention by seeing how the exchange rate swings on persistent dollar buying or selling by nationalised banks. These banks work as a go-between the RBI and the markets.

However, if the RBI has to intervene in offshore markets — located in Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and New York — it has to do it through local banks there. Or, it can take help from other central banks, which can intervene directly.

At present, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha and Rajasthan are among the top performing Indian states with regards to creating conducive environment for start-ups.

Under the new policy, all the 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh will have a nodal officer to promote start-ups and forge working alliances with the educational and technical institutions to promote new business ventures.

Reviewing the draft Uttar Pradesh Startup Policy on Tuesday evening here, chief minister stressed that the state possessed large untapped potential in the startup segment even as he directed officials to create a mechanism of coordination between the different wings of the state government and higher educational institutions, agricultural universities.

There are about 9 million micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) in Uttar Pradesh, he said adding this large pool of businesses presented humongous opportunity to cultivate a culture of start-ups.

The CM instructed the departmental heads to simply the rules regarding start-ups and to prepare an action plan to nurture such units in every sector.

The Centre has already launched a flagship Startup India initiative to build a strong ecosystem for the growth of startups, promote sustainable economic growth and generate mass employment opportunities in the country.

Meanwhile, Adityanath also directed for introducing academic courses focussing on entrepreneurial development from the university level itself and to liberalise the procedures regarding the approval, certification and promotion of in the state.

Earlier, the state government had proposed to set up a Rs 200 crore venture capital fund to promote MSME startups, especially pertaining to the indigenous industries. The fund will accord priority to such units, which are engaged in the manufacturing of traditional products and crafts under the aegis of state’s flagship ‘One District, One Product’ (ODOP) scheme.

SIDBI would also function as the venture capital fund manager and facilitate credit flow to the MSMEs, start-ups and artisans by coordinating with different microfinance institutions, non-banking financial companies (NBFC) and other such integrators.

The central refinance bank is also expected to share the database of state ODOP enterprises and artisans for chalking out future roadmap pertaining to their training, capacity building, credit requirement and growth.

Launched in January 2018, ODOP is aimed at scaling up traditional industries associated with each of the 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh.

['Jon Hurdle'],"Much attention is paid to how entrepreneurs create an innovative product or service and bring it to market, pivoting quickly to solve financial and logistical challenges along the way. But after the start-up buzz wears off, owners must figure out how to scale their businesses for long-term, stable growth.

Rather than simply working harder, a new report suggests, second-stage should consider a different strategy to reach the middle market, incorporating five conditions that were compiled and tracked by TrueSpace, a consulting firm, and the analytics firm Gallup.

They looked at nearly 2,500 entrepreneurs in the United States over five years to create the model, which is geared toward businesses with $2 million to $10 million in annual revenue that are struggling to become midsize

“After you get to this post-start-up phase, you have to fundamentally almost recreate the business,” said Joe Daly, senior partner at Gallup. “That’s what begins to create the conditions for the next leap in growth.”

The report, released Thursday, identified the five conditions that small businesses should consider adopting: organizational alignment, operating discipline, predictability of performance, endurance of stakeholders and value creation.

The project’s data shows that the tighter a company’s focus on its market, the stronger its revenue will be, said Charles Fred, chairman and chief executive of TrueSpace. But most entrepreneurs do the opposite when faced with flagging sales, and end up dissipating their energies without the desired results.

Second-stage may have trouble growing if they do not take a strategic approach to their expansion, said Gad Allon, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

“Where these firms usually struggle is that the opportunistic approach that brought them to where they are doesn’t work as the firm grows,” Dr. Allon said.

He added that the framework provided by TrueSpace could be useful, but that it was unlikely to be able to predict performance. “It’s good advice, but there’s nothing new in this good advice,” he said.

Damian Salas, assistant dean at Drexel University’s Charles D. Close School of Entrepreneurship in Philadelphia, agreed that the ideas behind the five conditions were not new, but said their combination was novel and could offer second-stage companies a way of moving to the next level.

“Small businesses are generally reactive organizations, and growth is often just another challenge to meet,” he said.

For some business owners, the framework has already helped increase revenue.

SurgiReal, based in Loveland, Colo., builds task trainers to help medical professionals acquire skills they need like giving injections or sewing sutures. It is “on the cusp” of $2 million in annual revenue, said Andrew Hendrickson, the company’s chief executive. He had been trying to sell the products in about half a dozen markets, but he found that growth was well short of its potential.

“We were past the point of being a like a true start-up but not quite at middle market yet,” Mr. Hendrickson said. “It was time to graduate to someone who was going to help us do scaling.”

He added that the TrueSpace strategy had sharply focused the company’s efforts.

“We had cast our net too wide,” he said. “Rather than looking at five or six market segments to be tackled individually, we were tackling them all at the same time, which prevented us from really penetrating one to a greater extent.”

Now the company is concentrating on selling to just one market segment within the medical industry.

Shawn K. Smith, the chief executive of Modern Teacher, an educational technology company in Chicago, had a similar experience. The company has been using the TrueSpace model for two years, and Mr. Smith said it had increased the company’s enterprise value up to seven times its revenue, from one to two times revenue.

Mr. Smith said the model had allowed the company to go from essentially being a consultant dependent on nonrecurring revenue to being one with sustainable income and a clear path to growth.

With current revenue just under $3 million a year, Modern Teacher aims to hit $5 million in 18 months, he said.

Other consulting firms and colleges offer guidance on business strategy, but much of it is geared to start-ups or larger companies, Mr. Smith said, and there’s not much help out there for firms in his category.

“There was so much clarity in it,” he said of the TrueSpace program. “We had some of the pieces in place. But alignment to the market was critical for us because what that produced was predictability.”",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/a-formula-for-growth-after-the-start-up-stage-120022200892_1.html,Business Standard,Start Ups,TRUE

In its year-end report, major shareholder Kinnevik, a Swedish investment firm, devalued by 45 per cent, referring to the exaggerated revenue resulting from fraudulent transactions that rocked the company. is now valued at about $577 million, a significant drop for the Bengaluru-based startup.

“Our assessed fair value of our Quikr investment is lowered by SEK 764 million, or 45 per cent, reflecting the impact of fraudulent transactions as well as a reduced footprint and amended revenue recognition principles,” said Kinnevik this month, in its presentation of the fourth quarter and full-year 2019. “The valuation is established using forward looking net revenue multiples, moving away from the DCF (discounted cash flow) method applied in previous quarters to solely reflect near-term projected financial performance in our net asset value statement.”

Quikr has a slew of online businesses covering real estate, discover and bookings, jobs search, used-goods buying and selling, and home services. The drop in valuation comes at a time, when the company had to suffer crores of losses due to internal employee fraud and as reported, the firm had to lay off hundreds of employees across the organisation late last year.

In the earning call, Samuel Sjöström, Head of Strategy at Kinnevik, explained that Quikr discovered that certain dealers and vendors within their managed rentals and car segments had placed fictitious or misrepresented transactions on its platform. The direct effect of this was twofold.

“Firstly, the value of revenue generated in these categories may be overstated. And secondly, there is a risk that some receivables may not be entirely recoverable. As a response, the company has reduced its footprint in the concerned segments as managing its overall cost base. Quikr has also strengthened its internal operational controls and is pursuing legal actions against those responsible,” said Sjöström, in the earnings call.

He said going forward Quikr's other business segments, such as blue-collar jobs, used goods, classifieds and real-estate sales have historically accounted for a majority of revenue and continue to see growth and occupy strong positions in the respective markets.

“While we are very disappointed with what has been uncovered and its effect on the value of our investment, we believe that the measures that have been taken and are being taken are both forceful and proportionate, and their clear intention is to leave us with a healthier but somewhat smaller company,” said Sjöström.

Kinnevik CEO Georgi Ganev said in the earnings call that the Quikr has laid off a lot of their workforce, basically, half of the workforce in order to become profitable faster and not dependent on funding. “Which is, of course, something that we appreciate. So we sit now with a smaller company, but we also think it's much healthier. And we will, of course, focus on those remaining verticals and to continue to grow them going forward,” said Ganev. “So of course, we are very disappointed in what we have found at Quikr, but we remain confident that we will actually get out in a way that is somewhat more positive than what you see today for our shareholders,” said Ganev.

Founded in 2008, Quikr had left a memorable footprint in over 1000 cities.

""Startups are hesitant to do IPO, which is not difficult. My biggest issue with the ecosystem today is that they are not doing an Let the Indian public own these They get the wealth being created,"" he said while inaugurating the 5th edition of the two-day 'Seeding Kerala' organised by Kerala Mission (KSUM) here.

""India has $2 trillion of wealth in private hands. Less than one per cent is invested in ecosystem. We need High Networth Individuals (HNIs) money going into startups,"" he added.

Gopalakrishnan advised startups to take minimum funds from angel, friends and families. They have to create minimum viable product, and establish unit economics and profitable model, he underlined.

""To make a successful new business is one which employs people, creates jobs and employment, and it is a sustainable and profitable business you can run it for a long time.

""Longevity is the best measure for the successful business. Society needs stable businesses that create good jobs and creates wealth for the society. Our best late stage startups are owned by non-Indian entities. More than 95 per cent of funding comes from non-Indian entities,"" he said.

Noting that Kerala community is innovative, entrepreneurial and action-oriented, Gopalakrishnan said the startup ecosystem in the state is getting recognition for its innovation, ideas and path-breaking initiatives.

""Studies have shown that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector is the backbone of any economy. More than 60 per cent of jobs are created through them,"" he said.

Interestingly, maximum number of jobs are created in the first five years of the businesses of startups and there is a need for a large number of MSMEs, he added.

""New jobs are created only if new businesses are created. We need to have best milieu for new business for maximum job creation. Among the with largest market capital in the world today, except Amazon, rest of them employ very few people. There are significant opportunities today to disrupt any business,"" he said.

Gopalakrishnan said India today has one of the most advanced fintech ecosystems, which even the US is also looking to implement. He also suggested creation of a database of viable businesses leveraging local strengths and ecosystem.

""We need to identify people passionate about starting a business and train them on business basics, including running business legally and ethically. They can select a business from the database and get trained on the business idea, followed by registering it,"" he explained.

Gopalakrishnan also interacted with 10 startup founders on the sidelines of the event.

M Sivasankar, Principal Secretary (Electronics and IT), government of Kerala, who presided over the function, said, ""One of the ways to address scarcity of fund is to tap the funds from the alumni meet of engineering batches. Besides, we need to create networks of people, who believe in Kerala to invest.""



In his welcome address, Saji Gopinath, CEO, KSUM, said India is the third largest ecosystem for startups.

""We have close to around 28,000 startups registered in Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and 60 per cent of them are located in three of four cities. This shows the high growth of non-Indian industries, which play a pivotal role in growing such ecosystem. But in Kerala, we have the most homogenous startups.""

['Pavan Lall'],"Start-ups have seen the size of early-stage funding rounds almost double in the past two years because of increased foreign capital in the system, growing traction of established entrepreneurs, and evolved technology being used across sectors to grow faster, bigger and better.

Roopa Kudva, managing director with impact investor Omidyar Network India, says there are a lot more Chinese funds chasing today. That includes Fosun RZ Capital, CDH Investments, GGV Capital, Tencent Shunwei Capital, and Morningside Venture Capital.

According to market research by Tracxn, which tracks start-ups and funding, India saw investments of about $1.31 billion till November in calendar year 2019, up from just $65 million in 2017. “The other driver is that as the landscape has evolved, investors have become much more focused on unit economics, monetisation, and profitability than five years ago, when it was just growth that was chased,” Kudva adds.

Archana Hingorani, managing partner with early-stage venture fund Siana Capital, says that it’s clear that funding rounds have grown in value over the last couple years. “My sense is that two things are happening. It’s no longer just about fintech plays for VCs and investors.

The second is there is a need across the board for any business model to improve with the incorporation of technology and that doesn’t matter how you define it whether it is software, AI, or machine learning. Take healthcare, for example, everything on it is being overhauled as we speak, and that leads to a large appetite for capital.”

For instance, Omidyar invested in Healofy, a pregnancy and parenting app that caters to people in regional languages, and just announced another investment in Axio, a medtech venture that uses military-grade technology to stop bleeding immediately.

The other push is coming from the fact that there are far more established entrepreneurs in India today who are looking to start the next venture than five years ago. Examples include Freecharge Chairman Kunal Shah, who started CRED; former Myntra Founder Mukesh Bansal, who started Cure.fit; former Ibibo founder Ashish Kashyap, who started INDwealth; and, Sachin Bhatia, the former co-founder of MakeMyTrip, who co-started Bulbul.tv.

“Once an entrepreneur has had a track record of success, it automatically allows for the next venture to be capitalised and funded at higher levels,” Kudva said.

In addition, while several ventures backed by private equity (PEs) and VCs earlier were copycats of international businesses — including Flipkart and Ola — today the model is about looking to build businesses that solve India-specific problems.

For example, RailYatri, an indian travel marketplace site, provides information on which platform is crowded, what the chances are of a ticket being confirmed.

Sandeep Murthy, partner with venture capital firm Lightbox, which backed Bombay Shirt Company, and Rebel Foods, says that the trend isn’t limited to India. “I would argue that it’s a trend globally and is because of a mix of things,” he says. “What a company used to need has all gone up: cost of customer acquisitions, cost of efficiencies in technologies, and the cost of managerial talent.” The cost of a product head that was Rs 50 lakh three years ago is now between Rs 70-80 lakh.

The Accel and Sequoia-backed company has won a competitive bid to provide its dockless scooter-sharing service at the railway stations in Karnataka. This makes it the first start-up to win such a deal.

The company will be able to expand its operations across 13 Bengaluru railway stations, helping passengers in the city with first and last-mile connectivity.

“With the load on road infrastructure, there is an urgent need to shift away from personal mobility to public transportation and shared mobility. To increase adoption of public transportation, it’s imperative to create integrated multimodal connectivity to make daily commute seamless,” said Vivekananda Hallekere, chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder,

“We’re happy to be working with the authorities such as Bengaluru Railway Division, which recognised the importance of shared mobility services and enabled us further to provide accessible mobility. This is happening for the first time ever in the country. We are positive that it’ll help lakhs of railway commuters with their first and last-mile commute.”

Through the partnership with the Bengaluru Railway Division, plans to introduce 698 scooters at 13 Bengaluru railway stations. Bounce scooters will make their debut at places such as Bellandur, Yelahanka, Banaswadi, Whitefield, Yeshwanthpur and Kengeri.

Parking lots have been allotted at two entrances in each of these stations to pick up or drop off Bounce bikes.

By providing bike service from the premise of railway stations, Bounce said it aims to improve connectivity and encourage citizens to use railway services.

Integration of hired, shared and public transport services will ensure all modes of commute complement each other and provide a seamless experience to citizens.

It is particularly popular among office-goers looking to avoid traffic.

This year, 1.5 lakh passengers opted to travel by the South Western Railway’s intracity trains, an increase from 1.4 lakh passengers in 2016-17.

According to a recent proposal by Rail India Technical and Economic Service (Rites), suburban trains are projected to have a total daily ridership of 9.28 lakh in 2025.

At a time when hours spent commuting has gone up because of traffic congestion, Bounce feels suburban railway acts as a cheap and fast alternative for the long commute.

However, the first and last-mile connectivity is still a critical issue. In Bengaluru, railways see lakhs of people coming in or going out of the city from various stations. The city’s fragmented transport system and evolving public transport impact a sizable number of these travellers. A recent survey showed that 70 per cent of citizens in Bengaluru felt the need for improving first and last-mile connectivity.

Bounce, which was recently valued at $500 million in a funding round, is scaling on a par with global players, including US-based scooter rental Lime and Bird.

The company has already partnered three Mass Rapid Transport systems – Namma Metro, Hyderabad Metro and Nagpur Metro. Within a year, 42 per cent of Bounce rides either originated or culminated at Namma Metro; around 40,000 of the nearly one lakh daily rides undertaken have been metro commuters.

The company operates in Bengaluru with 13,000 dockless scooters and has a presence in over 35 cities in the rental and docked model.

['Yuvraj Malik'],"Sachin Bansal-owned Navi Technologies has acquired MavenHive, a technology consulting firm based out of Bengaluru, to bolster its offering to start-ups.



Seven-year old MavenHive helps clients in product development, including software development, systems integration, app development and data analytics. It has consulted for firms like Flipkart, Gojek, Grasshopper, and Scripbox, among others.



“This acquisition will add to Navi’s technology capabilities,” said Bansal, chief executive officer (CEO), Navi Technologies, in a statement.



The two parties did not share the deal size but said MavenHive's two founders and 40-odd team members have joined the Bansal-owned firm.



MavenHive was started by Bhavin Javia and Anandha Krishnan in 2012. Javia has 15 years of IT consulting experience across various firms, where he has led teams and helped scale business-critical applications. Krishnan has built several large-scale applications and distributed systems. Both have had long stints at ThoughtWorks, a global software delivery and consulting firm.



“We are very eager to start working with Sachin, and with Navi” said Javia. “We were awed by the kind of organisation that he built into. So, when Yogi Kulkarni (ex-Principal Architect of and VP of Engineering at Navi) introduced us to this opportunity, we were excited to be part of the next leg of their journey,” he said.

Bansal’s latest acqui-hire is likely to bring significant upside and scale to the operations of Navi Technologies, which is into investing and scaling early-stage start-ups with a focus on financial services. He is likely to use the new asset to build tech-applications to automate businesses processes and other functions like hiring, operations, and growth at investee firms at scale.

Months after exiting Flipkart, Bansal set up BAC Acquisitions, later renamed Navi Technologies, in December 2018. He set up the business with his Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi (IIT-D) batchmate Ankit Agarwal to invest in start-ups through a mix of equity and debt.



So far, Navi Technologies has invested in Kissht, Bounce, Vogo, Krazybee, Altico Capital, and CRIDS. In fact, in some of the deals Bansal has invested directly as well.



Recently, Bansal recapitalized Navi Technologies through fresh investment of Rs 888 crore.



Talking about the deal, Bansal said, “We are very excited about this acquisition which will add great capability to our ambitions to build cutting edge technology platforms that can take applications to scale.”



Meanwhile, Bansal has taken the reins at non-banking financial services company (NBFC) Chaitanya India Fin Credit, which he acquired in September. He acquired a majority stake in the rural-lending firm for Rs 740 crore and became its CEO.



Currently, he is said to be putting in place a new technology infrastructure at Chaitanya, as he prepares to scale the business further into a full-services micro-finance bank.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/sachin-bansal-owned-navi-technologies-acquihires-software-firm-mavenhive-119122600845_1.html,Business Standard,Start Ups,TRUE

['Kyle Buchanan'],"Best Picture

1917; Ford v Ferrari; The Irishman; Jojo Rabbit; Joker; Little Women; Marriage Story; Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Parasite

As your Oscar-pool guru, I would be remiss in predicting any best-picture winner besides 1917. The Sam Mendes-directed war movie has taken top honours from both the Producers and Directors guilds as well the director and drama prizes at the Golden Globes, and that’s the sort of awards-season war chest no other contender can compete with. Though it debuted late last year, 1917 is cresting at just the right time: After six weeks of release, it’s made more than $120 million domestically, and it occupied the No. 2 slot at the box office last weekend.

But.

I still can’t shake the feeling that Parasite could pull off an upset, in much the same way Moonlight vaulted over La La Land just three years ago. Bong Joon Ho’s widely loved South Korean thriller would be the first foreign-language film to win best picture, and by picking it, voters could help rehabilitate the academy’s reputation for being too insular and white. The film’s cast members garnered a standing ovation at the Screen Actors Guild Awards even before they won the top prize of the night. Parasite has passion, no doubt.

Is that enough? I’m playing it safe with 1917, but stay tuned: It’ll be close.

Best Director

Sam Mendes, 1917; Martin Scorsese, The Irishman; Todd Phillips, Joker; Quentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite

Five of the last seven Oscar races have come down to a split in the top two categories, so is it possible that even if 1917 wins best picture, Bong could still be rewarded with the best-director Oscar? Yes, though I wouldn’t bet on it: When such a split occurs, the directing winner usually hails from the bigger, more technically audacious film, and that describes Mendes and his long-take war movie to a T.

Best Actor

Joaquin Phoenix, Joker; Antonio Banderas, Pain and Glory; Leonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Adam Driver, Marriage Story; Jonathan Pryce, The Two Popes

Oscar voters are drawn to the tangible act of transformation, and though many of the nominees in this category are playing against type — including DiCaprio as a washed-up actor and Banderas as a quiet artist wrestling with pain — there is no more ostentatious act of transformation than Phoenix’s wrenching, intensely physical performance as the Joker. Considered by many to be the best actor of his generation, Phoenix has never won an Oscar. That will change on Sunday.

Best Actress

Renee Zellweger, Judy; Cynthia Erivo, Harriet; Scarlett Johansson, Marriage Story; Saoirse Ronan, Little Women; Charlize Theron, Bombshell

Sixteen years after Zellweger was awarded her first Oscar, a supporting-actress trophy for Cold Mountain, she will again return to the winner’s circle for playing a down-and-out Judy Garland in the last year of her life. None of the other contenders ever amassed enough momentum to truly compete with Zellweger, who’s been sitting pretty as the favourite all season. She’ll now become the 21st woman to win more than one Oscar for acting.

Best Supporting Actor

Brad Pitt, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Tom Hanks, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood; Anthony Hopkins, The Two Popes; Al Pacino, The Irishman; Joe Pesci, The Irishman

Though the 56-year-old Pitt already possesses an Oscar for producing the best-picture winner 12 Years a Slave, he has never won an Academy Award for acting, and his confident performance in Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood offers a full-throttle testimonial to his star power. After charming and unexpectedly funny acceptance speeches at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards, there’s no way Pitt goes home on Oscar night empty-handed. Don’t you want to know what he’ll say?

Best Supporting Actress

Laura Dern, Marriage Story; Kathy Bates, Richard Jewell; Scarlett Johansson, Jojo Rabbit; Florence Pugh, Little Women; Margot Robbie, Bombshell

Dern has a clear path to victory here: The only supporting-actress contender who had earned a comparable amount of buzz was the Hustlers star Jennifer Lopez, and she didn’t even make the list of five nominees. For voters who enjoyed Marriage Story, a vote for Dern ensures the movie won’t go home empty-handed, and the 52-year-old actress is an enormously well-liked figure enjoying the sort of career resurgence that Oscar is always eager to reward.

Original Screenplay

Parasite, Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Won; Knives Out, Rian Johnson; Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach; 1917, Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns; Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino

Tarantino has won the original-screenplay Oscar twice before, so he can’t be counted out here. Still, the path to best picture almost always goes through one of the screenplay categories, and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood has lost much of its momentum for the top award. The best-picture front-runner 1917 is probably too sparse a screenplay to win in this category, so I expect the win will go to twisty Parasite, the night’s other big contender for the top Oscar.

['Ben Sisario'],"Lizzo, a charismatic new pop and R&B star, has been nominated for eight prizes at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards, leading a class dominated by fresh faces like Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X.

Lizzo spent much of the last decade as a struggling rapper and singer, but broke through this year with hits like “Juice” and “Truth Hurts,” and a bold, body-positive persona. Little known to mainstream audiences a year ago, she is now up for every major award at the Grammys, including album of the year for the deluxe version of “Cuz I Love You,” record and song of the year for “Truth Hurts,” and best new artist, the Recording Academy announced on Wednesday.

Not so long ago, the Grammys were routinely criticised for rewarding journeyman stars and rock elders at the expense of pop’s younger and more vital ranks. No longer. Continuing a trend that has been building for several years, the latest crop of nominees are young, diverse and largely reflective of the forefront of pop.

Lizzo’s competition includes two artists with six nominations each: Eilish, a 17-year-old alternative auteur who has built a wildly devoted following, and Lil Nas X, a 20-year-old rapper and master of internet memes whose “country-trap” hybrid “Old Town Road” became an all-pervasive cultural phenomenon this year, breaking Billboard’s singles chart record with 19 weeks at No. 1.

Eilish’s “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” is up for album of the year; “Bad Guy” is up for record and song of the year; and Eilish is a contender for best new artist. She is the youngest person to be nominated for all four top categories. Finneas O’Connell, her brother and primary collaborator, received five nods for his work with her as a producer and songwriter.

Lil Nas X was nominated for record of the year for the remix of “Old Town Road” (which features the country star Billy Ray Cyrus) and album of the year for “7,” an eight-song EP. He is also up for best new artist, in what may be seen as a challenge to the academy’s more conservative voting ranks, who have often been reluctant to reward artists they view as untested.

Alternative auteur Billie Eilish

But Lil Nas X has also come to stand for many of the changes now sweeping pop music. “Old Town Road” first exploded as a hit on TikTok, the video app, and his blithe combination of rap and country highlighted the increasing blurring of genre. At first, Nashville struggled to accept him; last week, “Old Town Road” won best musical event at the Country Music Association Awards.

Even so, Lil Nas X was not nominated in any of the Grammys’ country categories. The nominees for country album of the year are Eric Church’s “Desperate Man,” Reba McEntire’s “Stronger Than the Truth,” Pistol Annies’ “Interstate Gospel,” Thomas Rhett’s “Center Point Road” and Tanya Tucker’s “While I’m Livin’.”

The awards ceremony will be held on Jan. 26 in Los Angeles, and broadcast by CBS.

Among this year’s other top nominees, Ariana Grande received five nods, including record of the year for “7 Rings” — a recasting of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “My Favorite Things” — and album of the year for “Thank U, Next.” The young R&B singer H.E.R., who took home two awards at the most recent Grammys, is also up for five, including album of the year for “I Used to Know Her” and record and song of the year for “Hard Place.” (Record of the year is for performers and producers, while the song category recognises songwriters.)

Winners will be chosen by the academy’s 11,000 voting members.

['Vanessa Friedman'],"Jean Paul Gaultier, the French designer who put Madonna in a bullet-bra and men in skirts, scandalised the couture establishment by hosting the TV show “Eurotrash” and never forgot his sense of humour, yet could cut a tuxedo with such panache he was regarded as an heir to Yves Saint Laurent, said goodbye to the runway after 50 years this week.

He did it in the gilded 19th-century Théâtre du Châtelet, where the Ballets Russes once danced, in front of a packed 2,500-seat audience that included the former supermodel and the former French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and the designers Nicolas Ghesquière (who began his career as a junior assistant to Gaultier), Christian Lacroix and Dries Van Noten, who had made the trip in from Antwerp, Belgium, just for the evening.

And he did it with a greatest hits spectacular starring friends and family, from the actors Béatrice Dalle and Rossy De Palma to the models Yasmin Le Bon and Paris Jackson, plus the burlesque star Dita Von Teese. Plus Boy George, who opened the whole thing with his own version of Amy Winehouse’s “Back to Black,” and closed it with “Church of the Poison Mind”.

Gaultier, 67, stepped back from the ready-to-wear runway in 2014, but this was his final farewell — at least to shows. It seems he will continue to have some role in his company, which is owned by the Spanish group Puig, and he’s already dabbling in a sideline as a cabaret director. He announced his departure from the catwalk only five days ago, via Instagram.

To a certain extent, simply surviving a half century is an achievement in a fashion world where these days designers seem to come and go almost annually. Gaultier navigated the move from family-run artisanal houses to global brands dominated by mega groups, and did his time as creative director of a big house, taking the reins at Hermès from 2003 to 2010. If he has been, latterly, more of a prankster than anything else, wallowing in his own thematic puns — 1980s pop stars! Nanook of the North! — sometimes to the detriment of the clothes themselves, he also helped the shape the industry as we know it.

His final collection was no different; balanced on the knife edge between showgirl and chic, listing toward the former. Gaultier overindulged himself with more than 200 looks, not just reminders of favourites past (corsetry and underwear-as-outerwear; denim sliced and embroidered and elevated; tuxedo trousers turned into hot pants in front, the legs streaming out like a train behind; the blue-and-white-striped marinière; a body suit with the naked body embroidered on top) but examples of his artistry; his ability to make you look — and then think again.

He didn’t just recycle his themes, he upcycled his fabrics, melding silk ties into striped skirts, leather bombers into a bubble mini, and false-fronting jackets onto the top of corsets.

Camouflage coats billowed like clouds; columns of crochet encrusted in elaborate embroidered runes; basket-woven leathers; a breast plate made from mother-of-pearl shells atop a skirt made of real sponges.

“I have opened all my drawers, taken back all my old collections,” he wrote in his farewell note. “I have used my archives as material. Goodbye, the brand-new; hello, the brand old. What I did at the beginning with no resources, I do today with my inheritance to give life to new creations.”

Overlying it all was such a reservoir of well-earned good will, it cast the entire collection in a rosy glow.

And it was a potent reminder, as the designer was carried off on the arms of his cast, dancing and hugging his way into his future, that fashion ought to be both challenging and fun, and is best accessorised with laughter.

['Veer Arjun Singh'],"dreamt of a gravity-defying shoe and shot off its beloved Ultraboost to the International Space Station. While it did get a futuristic paint-job that screams “I was in space”, the Ultraboost 20 seems to have learned the rest from Earth’s streets. It’s a refresher of last year’s Ultraboost 19 with subtle but crucial changes. Here’s how the pair felt on feet in Delhi’s punishing cold.

Design (4/5)

The Ultraboost 19 introduced a one-piece upper that wraps around the foot like a sock called PrimeKnit. In most colourways, it has a multi-colour hue with an additional layer of threading in the vamp area or around the midsole or both. The UB20 changes the upper to a uniformly coloured, single-tone PrimeKnit textile, reminiscent of the original Ultraboost. A single colour upper goes well with the alien-inspired purple-hued, multi-colored midsole. I’d recommend the black colourway (pictured) if you are a runner first and a sneakerhead after. The white and grey, much like the many colourways of the UB19, are beautiful sneakers but impractical for a performance shoe that mustn’t be boxed.

The translucent lace cage of the UB19 also gets a revamp with a reflective three-stripes logo. The tongue looks tidier in a single stitch. The heel, constructed with neoprene instead of PrimeKnit, is a change I appreciate the most. It does not rub against the feet like fibre sometimes does. And the single, reflective orange stripe at the back is playful, and also useful during night runs.

My only disappointment with the design is that the skeletal heel-frame has already started losing colour in two weeks of rugged use. That’s poor performance for an ace running shoe that doubles up as a dope sneaker.

Performance (5/5)

The UB19 packs the most responsive cushioning I have ever experienced in a pair of shoes. And its uniformly stretchy PrimeKnit is great for long-distance running. Along with the Asics Gel-Nimbus 21, it has been my go-to running pair for some time now. But a few kilometres shy of completing a hundred in the pair, I have been longing for a few improvements. And surprisingly, the UB20 fixes most of them.

The legendary Boost midsole is noticeably more concentrated and perhaps slightly trimmed. It feels a bit like the Boost HD midsole of the Pulseboost HD — a very versatile pair currently available on discount for Rs 8,339 — but more premium. It’s still very responsive but less cushioned, something most runners I exchange notes with had hoped for.

The stretchy upper and the wide toe box still make my broad feet happy, but what I absolutely love in the UB20 is that new PrimeKnit feels less stiff around the vamp while a tailored double-stitch reinforces the edges around the toe box. It eases the strain during sharp turns and protects the foot from abrasions.

Verdict (4.5/5)

The cushioned yet rugged Ultraboost, which can clock more miles than most pairs without showing signs of weakness, has been tweaked to perform even better. At 300 grams a piece, it’s not the lightest of running shoes, but the UB20 for Rs 18,999 will take you the distance and last you very nearly a lifetime. Just what the distance runners ordered.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/lifestyle/ultraboost-20-at-300-grams-each-these-running-shoes-are-not-the-lightest-120010400027_1.html,Business Standard,Lifestyle,TRUE

['Kyle Buchanan'],"Best Picture

1917; Ford v Ferrari; The Irishman; Jojo Rabbit; Joker; Little Women; Marriage Story; Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Parasite

As your Oscar-pool guru, I would be remiss in predicting any best-picture winner besides 1917. The Sam Mendes-directed war movie has taken top honours from both the Producers and Directors guilds as well the director and drama prizes at the Golden Globes, and that’s the sort of awards-season war chest no other contender can compete with. Though it debuted late last year, 1917 is cresting at just the right time: After six weeks of release, it’s made more than $120 million domestically, and it occupied the No. 2 slot at the box office last weekend.

But.

I still can’t shake the feeling that Parasite could pull off an upset, in much the same way Moonlight vaulted over La La Land just three years ago. Bong Joon Ho’s widely loved South Korean thriller would be the first foreign-language film to win best picture, and by picking it, voters could help rehabilitate the academy’s reputation for being too insular and white. The film’s cast members garnered a standing ovation at the Screen Actors Guild Awards even before they won the top prize of the night. Parasite has passion, no doubt.

Is that enough? I’m playing it safe with 1917, but stay tuned: It’ll be close.

Best Director

Sam Mendes, 1917; Martin Scorsese, The Irishman; Todd Phillips, Joker; Quentin Tarantino, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite

Five of the last seven Oscar races have come down to a split in the top two categories, so is it possible that even if 1917 wins best picture, Bong could still be rewarded with the best-director Oscar? Yes, though I wouldn’t bet on it: When such a split occurs, the directing winner usually hails from the bigger, more technically audacious film, and that describes Mendes and his long-take war movie to a T.

Best Actor

Joaquin Phoenix, Joker; Antonio Banderas, Pain and Glory; Leonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood; Adam Driver, Marriage Story; Jonathan Pryce, The Two Popes

Oscar voters are drawn to the tangible act of transformation, and though many of the nominees in this category are playing against type — including DiCaprio as a washed-up actor and Banderas as a quiet artist wrestling with pain — there is no more ostentatious act of transformation than Phoenix’s wrenching, intensely physical performance as the Joker. Considered by many to be the best actor of his generation, Phoenix has never won an Oscar. That will change on Sunday.

Best Actress

Renee Zellweger, Judy; Cynthia Erivo, Harriet; Scarlett Johansson, Marriage Story; Saoirse Ronan, Little Women; Charlize Theron, Bombshell

Sixteen years after Zellweger was awarded her first Oscar, a supporting-actress trophy for Cold Mountain, she will again return to the winner’s circle for playing a down-and-out Judy Garland in the last year of her life. None of the other contenders ever amassed enough momentum to truly compete with Zellweger, who’s been sitting pretty as the favourite all season. She’ll now become the 21st woman to win more than one Oscar for acting.

For voters who enjoyed Marriage Story, a vote for Dern ensures the movie won’t go home empty-handed, and the 52-year-old actress is an enormously well-liked figure enjoying the sort of career resurgence that Oscar is always eager to reward.

A single colour upper goes well with the alien-inspired purple-hued, multi-colored midsole. I’d recommend the black colourway (pictured) if you are a runner first and a sneakerhead after. The white and grey, much like the many colourways of the UB19, are beautiful sneakers but impractical for a performance shoe that mustn’t be boxed.

The translucent lace cage of the UB19 also gets a revamp with a reflective three-stripes logo. The tongue looks tidier in a single stitch. The heel, constructed with neoprene instead of PrimeKnit, is a change I appreciate the most. It does not rub against the feet like fibre sometimes does. And the single, reflective orange stripe at the back is playful, and also useful during night runs.

My only disappointment with the design is that the skeletal heel-frame has already started losing colour in two weeks of rugged use. That’s poor performance for an ace running shoe that doubles up as a dope sneaker.

Performance (5/5)

The UB19 packs the most responsive cushioning I have ever experienced in a pair of shoes. And its uniformly stretchy PrimeKnit is great for long-distance running. Along with the Asics Gel-Nimbus 21, it has been my go-to running pair for some time now. But a few kilometres shy of completing a hundred in the pair, I have been longing for a few improvements. And surprisingly, the UB20 fixes most of them.

The legendary Boost midsole is noticeably more concentrated and perhaps slightly trimmed. It feels a bit like the Boost HD midsole of the Pulseboost HD — a very versatile pair currently available on discount for Rs 8,339 — but more premium. It’s still very responsive but less cushioned, something most runners I exchange notes with had hoped for.

The stretchy upper and the wide toe box still make my broad feet happy, but what I absolutely love in the UB20 is that new PrimeKnit feels less stiff around the vamp while a tailored double-stitch reinforces the edges around the toe box. It eases the strain during sharp turns and protects the foot from abrasions.

Verdict (4.5/5)

The cushioned yet rugged Ultraboost, which can clock more miles than most pairs without showing signs of weakness, has been tweaked to perform even better. At 300 grams a piece, it’s not the lightest of running shoes, but the UB20 for Rs 18,999 will take you the distance and last you very nearly a lifetime. Just what the distance runners ordered.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/lifestyle/ultraboost-20-at-300-grams-each-these-running-shoes-are-not-the-lightest-120010400027_1.html,Business Standard,Lifestyle,TRUE

['Virendra Singh Rawat'],"Amid the global lockdown of cities and academic institutions following the outbreak, the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) has announced to provide free online tutorials in Python to universities worldwide.

Popular globally, Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. The free online support would be provided through Prutor.ai, a proprietary suite developed at IIT-K. Prutor, which offers many specialised online courses, has already been adopted by IIT Mumbai, IIT Goa, IIT Madras and other leading institutions to teach coding.

According to an IIT-K communiqué, most colleges had to cancel their physical classes to prevent the from spreading. In this regard, the Institute has made the online content and access to Prutor free to any university and college in the world, which cannot take physical classes anymore due to the pandemic.

In fact, the Institute has also called upon companies to contribute their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to further expand the reach of the free tutorial offer.

“Prutor.ai is a technology that is not available anywhere else, and IIT Kanpur would be happy to provide it to any university and college willing to adopt it. We want to teach coding to as many students as possible. If any company can share some CSR funds then we can help accelerate this,” Dr Amey, who developed Prutor, noted.

The interested educational institutions can sign up through an online portal (https://prutor.ai/) and will have free access through July 31, 2020 for any number of students. Until recently, this advanced tool and associated video lectures were available only to select IITs.

According to Amey, only the top Indian universities are equipped for such online learning modules, while the majority of others still lack the necessary infrastructure to run such specialised courses on their own.

He said Prutor was a proprietary technology developed at IIT Kanpur over the last six years utilising thousands of hours of teachers and students. “Any student above the 8th standard can learn programming using Prutor.”

"['Neha Alawadhi', 'Samreen Ahmad']","Online companies in India and globally are offering their paid programmmes to students — whether in school or pursuing higher — free of cost because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beginning Thursday, online learning giant said it is going to provide every impacted university in the world free access to its course catalogue through ‘ for Campus’ until July 31.

“We’re going to make ‘ for Campus’ offering freely available to any college or university in the world that is impacted by coronavirus, in the hope that they can rapidly allow students to start learning and ensure we have minimal impact from on the student community,” said Leah Belsky, chief enterprise officer and senior vice-president, Coursera.

Coursera, founded by Stanford Professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, has 48 million registered learners worldwide and offers courses, specialisations, degrees, and certificate programmes online.

The ‘Coursera for Campus’ offers job-relevant online to students, alumni, faculty, and employees of firms like Mindtree, Tata Communications, Axis Bank, Infosys, Airtel, and Manipal Group.

Indian universities can continue teaching their students online without creating new infrastructure. Coursera’s existing ‘Coursera for Campus’ partners include Manipal Academy of Higher Education, UPES, Shiv Nadar University, KL University, NMIMS, and Pearl Academy.

In India, it has 5 million registered learners, and is adding over 100,000 learners per month.



Universities can sign up to provide their enrolled students with access to more than 3,800 courses and 400 specialisations from Coursera’s top university and industry partners.

Similarly, Indian education technology firms are also offering free classes and course material for students impacted by the novel On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

Bengaluru-based edtech firm Simplilearn is providing free access to its courses, based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, Big Data, and cybersecurity, among others, to its users.

“We understand the possible restrictions (due to the outbreak) and thereby continue to support the growth of our learners through our free online programmes on our app,” said Krishna Kumar, founder and chief executive, Simplilearn.

Byju’s also said it would provide free access to its complete app to school students till the end of April.

Some Indian states like Kerala, Karnataka and New Delhi have already announced the closure of schools.

A report states that the education of over 290 million students across 13 countries will be interrupted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vedantu too is offering support to students, parents and schools in Bengaluru, New Delhi, Kerala and Hyderabad to provide free access to its complete learning platform. Vedantu will offer free access to all live classes of Vedantu master teachers, study material, tests and assignments.

""We are constantly working on solutions that will drive evolution, fundamentally changing the pattern of teaching and learning today. We are here to support by making our platform free during this crucial time,” said Vamsi Krishna, CEO and co-founder, Vedantu.

Another edtech platform Unacademy said it will conduct close to 20,000 free live classes on its platform, across exam categories like UPSC, banking, railways and so on.

Unacademy claims it has 10,000 educators, 13 million learners, and subscriptions for over 30 exam categories.

Educational Initiatives, a 20-year old edtech company based out of Bengaluru is also offering 60 days free access of Mindspark to all students, so that the school closure due to COVID-19 does not impact their learning.

Mindspark is an artificial intelligence-powered specialised mathematics programme developed for children’s learning.

Popular globally, Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. The free online support would be provided through Prutor.ai, a proprietary suite developed at IIT-K. Prutor, which offers many specialised online courses, has already been adopted by IIT Mumbai, IIT Goa, IIT Madras and other leading institutions to teach coding.

According to an IIT-K communiqué, most colleges had to cancel their physical classes to prevent the from spreading. In this regard, the Institute has made the online content and access to Prutor free to any university and college in the world, which cannot take physical classes anymore due to the pandemic.

In fact, the Institute has also called upon companies to contribute their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to further expand the reach of the free tutorial offer.

“Prutor.ai is a technology that is not available anywhere else, and IIT Kanpur would be happy to provide it to any university and college willing to adopt it. We want to teach coding to as many students as possible. If any company can share some CSR funds then we can help accelerate this,” Dr Amey, who developed Prutor, noted.

The interested educational institutions can sign up through an online portal (https://prutor.ai/) and will have free access through July 31, 2020 for any number of students. Until recently, this advanced tool and associated video lectures were available only to select IITs.

According to Amey, only the top Indian universities are equipped for such online learning modules, while the majority of others still lack the necessary infrastructure to run such specialised courses on their own.

He said Prutor was a proprietary technology developed at IIT Kanpur over the last six years utilising thousands of hours of teachers and students. “Any student above the 8th standard can learn programming using Prutor.”
