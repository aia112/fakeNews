,"WASHINGTON—In a bid to secure support for his nomination as the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, Joe Biden reportedly pledged Sunday to select a woman as vice president since the position doesn’t entail much anyway. “I promise that my vice president will be a woman, since pretty much anyone can do this job, so I figure, hey, might as well pick a lady,” said Biden, adding that he knew from experience in his eight years as U.S. vice president that the position was essentially ceremonial and required no real work, so he had no reservations about handing it to a woman. “You basically just sit on your can all day and maybe show up at a meeting every month or two, so if a woman wants to do that, be my guest. I could see myself selecting [Senator] Amy Klobuchar, [former Georgia State Rep.] Stacey Abrams, or any one of the tens of millions of women perfectly capable of pulling off this no-show gig. I don’t really care what her politics are, and anyway it hardly matters. This works out well, actually, since I can stick a lady in the VP spot and don’t have to put one in an important role on the cabinet.” At press time, Biden was being praised by members of the media and his own party for his commitment to symbolic representation in an office that most people forget about half the time.

,"WASHINGTON—Beating out her rivals with the help of a little-known technicality, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) was named the Democratic Party’s nominee for president Wednesday after the discovery of an obscure rule that grants the nomination to whoever wins 0.7% of the vote in Missouri. “We weren’t expecting this, but after double-checking the party’s rules, it appears we are obliged to select Tulsi Gabbard as our candidate in 2020,” said Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez, shrugging his shoulders and pointing to a section of a crumbling, yellowed document that contains the esoteric bylaw. “I know a lot of Democrats were probably wondering why she was still in the race. But last night, while cross-referencing an old rule book in preparation for the upcoming debate, we came across this forgotten section of our charter, and, well, it all checks out. I admit it was a pretty cunning strategy on her part. With 100% of precincts now reporting, it appears the congresswoman received exactly 0.7% of votes in the Missouri primary yesterday. And so the time has come for us to put aside our differences and unite behind the next president of the United States, Tulsi Gabbard.” Perez went on to apologize on behalf of his entire party for not awarding the Democratic nomination for president to Sen. Furnifold McLendel Simmons (D-NC) in 1920.

So everyone should just relax and wait for them. They can send the fire department and the ambulance or both, and then they can probably give you a flu shot or something like that. It’s good. We’re in good shape.” At press time, White House sources confirmed the president had dialed 911 again to tell them that everything was actually fine and the nation didn’t need their help at all.

At the end of the day, whether you’re a Biden supporter or a Biden supporter, we have the same goal, which is to get Trump out of the White House and replace him with Joe Biden.” At press time, pundits launched into fevered speculations that the candidate’s speech could contain hints Joe Biden was mulling the choice to appoint Joe Biden as vice president.

The fact that I have already been able to serve as your VP and as a senator before that is a testament to what I can accomplish. No walls can contain my mind, and I promise that once I am released, we’re going to the DNC and then on to the White House.” At press time, Biden assured reporters that even if Nelson Mandela does not become his running mate, he does expect an endorsement from the anti-apartheid hero to be forthcoming.

I’ve dealt with the misfortune of seeing my hands reach out and pull a woman uncomfortably close to me and the embarrassment of them mocking me and saying ‘Stop doing that.’ I’ve worked to get it under control, and I want my supporters to be confident that I will only occasionally be touching women over the course of the presidential campaign.” At press time, Biden was attributing his support of the Iraq war and opposition to school busing as the result of a challenging brain stutter.

I was lucid for 70 years! I honestly can’t figure you people out. Why are you just now saying Joe Biden should be president when I can’t hold a train of thought for longer than 10 seconds or talk to anyone on the campaign trail without getting agitated and sticking my finger in their face?

They, along with the tiny minority of working-class citizens in disenfranchised minority communities who object to the moderate platform of Joe Biden, should not be made to feel invisible in our democracy.” Randall later added that it was also important to listen to older Jewish people, except for the ones who cast ballots for Mike Bloomberg.

In fact, if we harness that energy, I have no doubt we can deliver a resounding defeat to the entire Democratic party.” Biden ended his victory speech by claiming that if this momentum continued, the Democrats could be celebrating their biggest victory over their opponents ever at July’s convention.

This election is too important for Americans to take a risk on this fantasy of a small city mayor who could magically transform politics. The disingenuous, ego-driven promises, soaring rhetoric, and lack of results are why people have grown sick of Washington, and why I should drop out of the presidential race.” At press time, Buttigieg had declined to endorse another candidate, noting that suggesting Democrats had any chance of winning in November would just be another empty promise.

People love this Like A Virgin album, it’s a lot of fun to dance to, and she needs to build on its success. Taking time away from that to focus on what are sure to be small, insubstantial roles in lackluster films? That’s career suicide.” Reminded by reporters that Madonna had won acclaim for her role in Desperately Seeking Susan just a few months after his videotaped remarks, a visibly angry Sanders argued that Rosanna Arquette had carried that entire film and anyone who said otherwise didn’t know “a goddamn thing” about acting.

I mean, I worked with the guy for eight years, and he hasn’t even reached out to test the waters. I’m not trying to overstate my significance, but it’s not crazy to think my vouching for what he did as vice president could really change the way this race shakes out, right? I mean, what the hell?

I mean, I’ve repeatedly argued I’d rather live in Venezuela under Nicolas Maduro than the totalitarian state of America. That’s crazy. And, frankly, I’m sure if Bernie saw me going online and telling women they were fucking corporatist bitches for supporting Warren, he would condemn it, because it distracts from his generally positive message.

That’s something I’ll never forget. May our two countries continue to exist in interplanetary harmony, sending a message of peace to the rest of the universe.” Trump later complimented Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to combat the intergalactic Muslim threat that puts their shared star system in danger.

It probably got tucked behind the rib cage. I really should have been more careful considering that was our only copy. We could try an X-ray, but they might be difficult to read because they’re probably all bloody.

Furthermore, banning the use of the common folding chair as an implement for slamming birds across the head is a holdover from the days of ignorant environmentalists who don’t respect traditional hunting. True woodsmen know that respecting nature often means wrapping barbed wire around your fist to pummel a Canada goose or digging your thumbs into the eyes of a woodcock, and that there isn’t a hunter alive who wouldn’t curb stomp a wild turkey.” President Trump then posed for photographs while repeatedly smashing a quail beak-first into one of the White House’s marble columns.

We’ve also received reports that Volokov can read minds, which would obviously make any counterintelligence efforts difficult, if not impossible.” At press time, terrified officials had escalated their warnings after a failed assassination attempt in which repeated stabbings, a gunshot wound to the head, and an apparent drowning in the freezing Potomac River failed to end the Russian mystic’s life.

This shape-shifting, multi-tentacled monster will then once more be unleashed upon the waters of the United States, restoring the property rights of American farmers, fossil fuel companies, and real estate developers.” The president went on to criticize “prophets of doom” who have predicted Gangthor the Malevolent will rise in a column of smoke and fire upon his release, blocking out the sun and blighting the earth with a thousand years of darkness.

He understood that civil disobedience is essential in fighting a corrupt system, so he wasn’t afraid to spend the night in jail or do a little quid pro quo. In fact, some of his most famous tweets were written from jail.” Conway added that it was a shame such a great civil rights leader had been impeached so young.

On just the first page it explicitly declares that all men are created equal, with absolutely no mention of women. And down here—look closely at these signatures that ratified this document as the supreme law of the land.

Maybe I got passed over because I’m already stalking a bunch of women here in the U.S., but I still would’ve been able to manage my time and make it work. It really hurts that they didn’t even bother to ask. It would be one thing if I didn’t have any experience in tracking women without them knowing, but I’m really good at it. I can keep quiet in an alleyway, or stay awake idling in the car, or huddle in a closet without a peep for hours. And I’m really good at gathering hair and undergarments. I just wish they’d given me a chance.” At press time, Miller had decided to cheer himself up by lying below the former ambassador’s bed wearing her clothing while she was asleep.

That’s all. Obviously, I can keep doing the simple stuff like biting my wife’s finger or challenging audience members to push-up contests seemingly out of nowhere. I know you think that’s helpful.

Not to mention the hair dryer whirring all day and night as the lady president does her hair.

You get to switch positions and also move around a lot, which is probably a better workout. Plus, I bet some of the taller guys like [Jacob] deGrom and [Dellin] Betances could probably spike the ball over the net. I think we can be honest with ourselves by now that we’re never really going to get anywhere with this baseball thing, and it sucks to just keep losing to teams that are way better than us, so let’s just sign up for something where we can actually have fun.” At press time, the Mets clubhouse had devolved into a heated argument after Juan Lagares said that volleyball sounded even worse than baseball and suggested just going bowling instead.

“Mr. Trump decided it would be humorous to have his little “Christie Kreme” (his new Secret Service name, according to insiders) around, so he created the special position just for him,” says Trump’s longtime attorney/bankruptcy expert, David Friedman.

In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a “yes, I’ll have another” man that won’t clash with his own oversize, portly ego. “I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him,” said Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and he knows he’ll do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.”

Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.

Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. “Mr. Christie’s transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless,” he said. “I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.”

Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trump’s campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a “gargantuan-sized heart” and is “the perfect fit” for the new court.

“Governor Christie is not only ‘pro-life’, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know,” Miller said, “and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, I’ve seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat.

While Virginia has long struggled with racism, momentum in support of the blackface community really picked up this week after a racist photograph surfaced on the yearbook page of Governor Ralph Northam. Northam has denied being in the photograph, but his denial fell flat after he confessed to having dressed in blackface for a Texas dance competition where he impersonated Michael Jackson by painting his face with shoe polish.

Fresh off the Northam news, Attorney General Mark Herring, second in line to assume the governorship of the Commonwealth, today admitted to dressing in blackface when he was a 19-year-old college student at the University of Virginia in 1980. Herring, who was among those calling on Northam to resign, said he was “deeply, deeply sorry for the paint that I cause with this revelation.”

Virginia’s Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, widely considered for the position of Governor in the event Northam resigns, has found himself in the midst of sexual assault allegations. No word on whether or not Democrats in the state will support his candidacy following the allegations.

This comes amid a spate of mall attacks throughout the U.S., leaving many area shoppers and victim advocacy groups wondering how such a tasteless joke could ever make its way into print.

A spokesperson for the Fox Valley Mall told local reporters they had no knowledge of the ad and said an investigation is underway to determine where it may have originated from. However, the mall will still honor the 10% discount as advertised.

“Oh that’s a load of horsesh*t,” said a Fox Valley Mall employee who asked to remain anonymous. “There’s no way that ad just magically appeared in the Sunday paper,” he said, “this is the new age of viral marketing. Better get used to it.” The employee said the sleazy ad fits the mall owners M.O. perfectly. “They knew it would create a stir and get people talking, and that is exactly what’s happened.”

Roger Holloway, founder of the victim’s rights advocacy group Triggerz, agrees. “It’s that mentality that says anything is fair game in the name of profits. Hell, I wouldn’t put it past some of these shop owners to stage some sort of false flag attack to get the registers ringing again.”

In the ‘Most Trustworthy’ category, Hillary scored a dismal 14% among active registered voters while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.





While the final tallies were a shock to many residents, MI Governor Rick Snyder isn’t surprised at all. “Well, what do you expect?” laughed Synder, “unlike the tap water in Flint, the folks here in Michigan can see right through that woman.”

Governor Snyder isn’t buying in to all the what he called “Hysterical hoopla” surrounding Flint’s water crisis, adding, “A lot of folks in Flint like to blame all of their problems on the water. We have a name for those types of people,” Snyder takes a pause for dramatic effect, “democrats.”

Oakland County resident Stanley Taylor agrees with the governor. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy.” Asked if he was surprised by the survey results, Stan replied, “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust Crooked Hillary.”

Past findings from the Make Michigan Great Again PAC were also critical of Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness. “Hillary’s lies affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral changes such as shortening of attention span, increased antisocial behavior, and reduced educational attainment.

,"Millions of Americans are in mourning after news broke this afternoon that rocker/activist Ted Nugent was still alive. Word broke early, spread quickly, and sent shock waves throughout the rock and roll community and the Republican Party, where Nugent, 68, is well-known for his fierce advocacy for conservative causes, unwavering support for the rights of gun owners and hunters, and ferocious loyalty and devotion to today’s true American patriots. The National Rifle Association issued the following statement:

Ted Nugent has proudly and patriotically served on the NRA’s board of directors since 1995. The Association shares a deep sense of shock with our 4.5 million members and countless millions of supporters as details of this catastrophic event continue to unfold.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), one of several organizations Nugent violently criticized in the past, also issued a statement expressing condolences.

Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. Highlights from Nugent’s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine, in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the [Viet Nam War] draft: he did not bathe, brush his teeth, or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre-induction physical. To sweeten the pot, he also defecated in his pants. “I was so proud,” Nugent recalled. In later years he denied those accounts, saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter. That same year, Nugent’s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts.

President Obama, the target of many of Nugent’s negative comments, reportedly expressed astonishment when informed during a cabinet meeting that Nugent had lived another day. During the White House’s daily media briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz informed the assembled press corps that the President asked members of his cabinet to join him in a moment of silence to acknowledge Nugent’s survival.

Throughout Detroit and surrounding suburbs, fans both old and new erected makeshift tributes to the rocker, lighting candles, singing songs, and leaving cards and ticket stubs from many of Nugent’s concerts as testimonials to a life still lived.

,"<National Report>This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming.

Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.”

“Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,” WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. “Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.”





WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. “Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.”

The study was commissioned in August 2011 by the Halliburton corporation, who wanted to learn if the energy giant should start manufacturing and selling solar panels domestically and internationally. Halliburton’s executives wanted to know more about the sustainability of solar energy and how photovoltaic technology might evolve over the next ten years. But based on the findings of WIT’s research in the field, Halliburton revealed on Friday that they will not be entering the solar energy market.

“Solar panels destroying the sun could potentially be the worst man-made climate disaster in the history of the world, and Halliburton will not be taking part in that,” the company stated in a press release issued Friday morning. “It’s obvious, based on the findings of this neutral scientific research group, that humans needs to become more dependent on fossil fuels like oil and coal, not less. Because these so-called `green technologies’ are far more dangerous to the Earth than any hydrofracking operation or deep-water drilling station.

21-year old Darrell Waterford, from Eugene in Oregon, was participating in a promotional video for Greenpeace, some 100 nautical miles away from the Australian city of Perth.

Along with four other members of the organization, Mr. Waterford decided to dive with some great white sharks in order to improve the marine predator’s public image and raise awareness about shark hunting.

The group shot some incredible footage during the first 30 minutes as they swam with a group of sharks caressing and even hugging the large animals.

Unfortunately for the young American, one of the sharks suddenly became aggressive after being hugged and suddenly attacked him.

It attacked Mr. Waterford and tore off his right arm right below the elbow. The young man lost a large amount of blood, but was able to get out of the water and was rapidly taken to the hospital.

Huei Li Chong, the leader of the expedition, described the violent attack in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

“The shark seemed really friendly at first, but then it went totally berserk. It charged Darrell and bit off his hand in an instant, so we all hurried out of the water before it killed us.”

According to him, the shark might have turned aggressive after smelling blood in the water.

“Sharks can be affectionate an cuddly when they’re calm, but the smell of blood activates their predator instincts. It’s not their fault, and we shouldn’t hold them responsible.”

Greenpeace has been campaigning for years against shark finning, which consists of the removal of fins from sharks, often while the shark is alive.

Despite the organization’s efforts, finning has increased dramatically since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures.

Greenpeace has been trying for years to improve the white shark’s image in order to obtain an international ban, similar to the international treaty that applies to commercial whaling.

The last time the Reds won the top flight title was in 1990, but they are currently 25 points ahead of Manchester City with just a handful of games remaining, and only a fool would bet against the title going to Merseyside.

Until the Coronavirus stepped in, that is.

Now, football authorities, everywhere, are banning handshakes, fans from attending games, and even the staging of matches, in a bid to thwart the spreading of the virus, and the Reds face losing the prize at the last breath.

Which, sort of, puts it in context for you.

But the reaction from Anfield has been swift and determined. The club has announced on its website that any attempt to abandon the season would be met with the strongest resistance, and the Liverpool legal team was thought to be standing by, and awaiting further instructions. An unnamed source said:

""We will contend any decision to abandon the season in the most robust way possible. In other words, the club will fight to the death.""

The David Knight Show covered this story Tuesday morning:

Also, as government officials scramble to procure a COVID-19 vaccination, Bill Gates and MIT have the technology to track vaccination records via an invisible tattoo.

Together, MIT and Gates have “created an ink that can be safely embedded in the skin alongside the vaccine itself, and it’s only visible using a special smartphone camera app and filter,” according to Futurism.

Futurism explains, “The invisible ‘tattoo’ accompanying the vaccine is a pattern made up of minuscule quantum dots — tiny semiconducting crystals that reflect light — that glows under infrared light. The pattern — and vaccine — gets delivered into the skin using hi-tech dissolvable microneedles made of a mixture of polymers and sugar.”

The journal Science Translational Medicine explains the technology as “a covert way to embed the record of a vaccination directly in a patient’s skin rather than documenting it electronically or on paper.”

In the face of COVID-19 panic and Democrat politicians pushing mandatory vaccinations, this technology could be used to track Americans who opt-out of a forced inoculation.

For example, even before the coronavirus outbreak MIT researcher Kevin McHugh, who worked on the project, said, “In areas where paper vaccination cards are often lost or do not exist at all, and electronic databases are unheard of, this technology could enable the rapid and anonymous detection of patient vaccination history to ensure that every child is vaccinated.”

As for Gates’ involvement in the program, he wasn’t just funding it, as Scientific American reports, but “the project came about following a direct request from Microsoft founder Bill Gates himself.”

Gates announced Friday he’d be stepping down from the board of Microsoft to focus more on philanthropic work during this worldwide pandemic.

,"People are understandably upset about the coronavirus epidemic, but if we’re not careful, an even greater danger lies ahead.

Sinister forces in American political life are using the crisis to incite war with China and to stir up bad feelings towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people are in fact heroic. They are our friends, not our enemies. But the forces of evil want you to think otherwise.

Concerning the coronavirus, the key fact to remember is that we know very little about it. The worst mistake we could make is to become jittery and panicked. As Bill Sardi, an outstanding expert on health issues, has pointed out,

There are two hotspots in the world for coronavirus infections: Wuhan, China (Hubei Province) and Italy. Both of these geographic areas were grappling with tuberculosis outbreaks prior to the eruption of the mutated COVID-19 coronavirus. Strangely, coronavirus appears to spread to the rest of the world from these hotspots via airplane travel. But the infection remains in those infected and may spread within a household, but not into the community. Other geographical outbreaks must be questioned as there are too many false positive tests to confirm COVID-19 coronavirus, which at this point in time may be nothing more than a passenger virus that accompanies tubercular infections.

If Sardi is right, the main thing we can do to keep safe is to close our borders to immigrants.

Unfortunately, people are using the epidemic to stir up bad feelings toward the Chinese people, because the epidemic began in Hubei Province there. Ironically, there is evidence that the virus was really sent to China from the US. Larry Romanoff, whose “Global Research” column often uncovers items that others miss, says:

Not only did the virus not originate at the seafood market, it did not originate in Wuhan at all, and it has now been proven that it did not originate in China but was brought to China from another country. Part of the proof of this assertion is that the genome varieties of the virus in Iran and Italy have been sequenced and declared to have no part of the variety that infected China and must, by definition, have originated elsewhere.

It would seem the only possibility for origination is the US because only that country has the “tree trunk” of all the varieties. And it may therefore be true that the original source of the COVID-19 virus was the US military bio-warfare lab at Fort Detrick. This would not be a surprise, given that the CDC completely shut down Fort Detrick, but also because, as I related in an earlier article, between 2005 and 2012 the US had experienced 1,059 events where pathogens had been either stolen or escaped from American bio-labs during the prior ten years—an average of one every three days.

But even if Romanoff is wrong, the epidemic was not the fault of the Chinese people. Rather, the responsibility lies with the Chinese government, which suppressed warnings by local doctors. Had these warnings been heeded, the disease could have been contained with little trouble.

Hate directed against the Chinese blocks efforts in the US to deal with the coronavirus problem. Chinese scientists have developed an efficient way to test for the virus that can process forty people in 130 minutes, instead of the 2–3-day wait for results from US tests. The US government has made no effort to get this test but instead keeps it out of the news. Instead, we hear ridiculous talk about supporting US pharmaceuticals instead of Chinese pharmaceuticals. We should be supporting free trade, so that we can get cheap drugs to US consumers. We should not help Big Pharma exploit American consumers.

Because the epidemic started in China and spread from there, hostility toward Chinese people living in the US has gone up. Chinese-owned stores have been threatened, and gun sales to Chinese who fear attacks have soared. Chinese restaurants are nearly empty.

The president’s talk about the “Chinese virus” fans the flame of ill feelings, and some fear that the government may provoke a war with China in order to distract attention from a tanking US economy. US government propaganda has spread false claims about predatory Chinese trade practices to get the American people ready for hostile action toward China. As David Stockman has observed,

Indeed, the entire intellectual property theft meme is just a scam under which the business lobbies have enlisted the FBI and other law enforcement branches to function as taxpayer-financed patent attorneys and litigants.

But that’s not the state’s job at all: Enforcement of intellectual property rights is a cost of doing business that should be borne by patent owners; and not, again, by the proverbial bus driver shopping at Walmart’s and finding the cost of his tariffed necessities rising because some company in China is allegedly stealing trade secrets. Of course, the ultimate case of Trade Nannyism is the perennial whining by the K-Street lobbies that nefarious trade abusers like China “subsidize” their exports.

Why, yes, they surely do….send foreign aid to American consumers, that is!

To the contrary, if you want to level the playing field for American producers and manufacturers, instruct the Fed to stop targeting 2% inflation, and, in fact, to get out of the way entirely so that the domestic economy can deflate its high prices, wages and costs and thereby become more competitive on the global markets.

Provoking war with China is an incredibly dangerous policy. Eric S. Margolis, an experienced foreign policy expert, has noted: “But in a US-China war, the Chinese would be fighting almost at home. The US would have to sustain a major conflict many thousands of miles from its home ports. America is the world’s genius when it comes to logistics and mass operations, but even so great distances are punishing. It would prove a bridge too far.” The US would be the aggressor in a war with China. The South China Sea belongs to them, not to us, yet we send our ships there and insist we have a right to control what happens there. Also, a great deal of China’s industry and agriculture is privately owned, so an attack on China would be an attack on private property. Both the neocons and the nationalist “Right” want war with China. We should aim at peace instead, as Murray Rothbard and Ron Paul have taught us.

If we ignore propaganda and look at the facts, we should recognize that the Chinese people are heroes. It’s a scandal, in fact, that few Westerners are even aware, or, if they are aware, that they are not conscious, of the bloody reality that prevailed in China between the years 1949 and 1976, the years of rule by Mao Zedong

How many died as a result of persecutions and the communist policies of Mao? Perhaps you care to guess? Many people over the years have attempted to guess. But they have always underestimated. As more data rolled in during the 1980s and 1990s, and as specialists have devoted themselves to investigations and estimates, the figures have become ever more reliable. And yet they remain imprecise. What kind of error term are we talking about? It could be as low as 40 million. It could be as high as 100 million—or more. In the Great Leap Forward from 1959 to 1961 alone, figures range between 20 million and 75 million. In the period before, 20 million. In the period after, tens of millions more.

As scholars in the area of mass death point out, most of us can’t imagine one hundred dead or one thousand. Above that, we are just talking about statistics: they have no conceptual meaning for us. And there is only so much ghastly information that our brains can absorb, only so much blood we can imagine. And yet there is more to why China’s communist experiment remains a hidden fact: it makes a decisive case against government power, one even more compelling than the cases of Russia or Germany in the twentieth century. Finally, in 1976, Mao died. Within a few months, his closest advisers were all imprisoned. And the reform began slowly at first and then gained breakneck speed. Civil liberties were restored (comparatively) and the rehabilitations began. Torturers were prosecuted. Economic controls were gradually relaxed. The economy, by virtue of human and private economic initiative, was transformed.

Having read the above, you are now in a tiny elite of people who know anything about the greatest death camp in the history of the world that China became between 1949 and 1976, an experiment in total control unlike anything other in history. Many more people today know more about China’s exploding cell phone batteries than the hundred million dead and the untold amount of suffering that occurred under communism.

When you hear complaints about the “Chinese virus” today, imagine millions in famine, with parents swapping children to eat in order to stay alive. Let’s have peace with China, not war, and let’s admire the hardworking, productive, and wonderful Chinese people.

As lockdowns progress, social isolation becomes the “new norm,” and face-to-face human interaction is restricted, the emergence of a pandemic virus will give Big Tech the chance to shine darkly on all of us.

There was already a trend toward social isolation enabled by advancing technology and social media before the virus emerged.

Big Tech is more than willing to give the world another nudge into a digital Plato’s cave.

Trump recently announced that Google is already acting as an extension of the U.S. government’s response to Coronavirus.

Big Tech is also “fighting misinformation” about the Coronavirus by censoring online content.

All major Big Tech companies issued a joint statement Monday that said:

After Facebook’s failed attempt to launch it’s digital currency Libra, Big Tech has another opportunity to push a new cashless system as calls to ban cash intensify.

A recent article from Forbes said that virtual reality offers a solution to travel bans:

“Virtual reality (VR) offers a solution to the travel bans companies all over the world are facing and the restrictions on large gatherings that are being imposed by governments.”

The fight for a pro-human future is now more important than ever. At the very least, the seeds of a pro human world need to be sown now so that when new systems emerge after a potential collapse, humanity has a chance.

['Frank Furedi'],"The language war is in full swing.

An open letter signed by leaders of Women’s Aid and the Women’s Equality Party demands that Oxford Dictionaries change their “sexist” definition of the word ‘woman.’

The authors of the letter published this week complain that the dictionary refers to a woman as a “bitch” or a “maid”, while a man is described as “a person with the qualities associated with males, such as bravery, spirit, or toughness.”

Like all serious dictionaries, Oxford draws attention to the different terms that are used in relation to a word. The campaign — which started last year with a petition by Maria Beatrice Giovanardi — wants the dictionary to drop terms such as “bitch”, “wench”, “bird” or “frail” in its historical definition of a woman.

The aim of this campaign is not simply to get Oxford University Press to erase references to words it does not like. Its main objective is to alter the way that people think about men, women, gender and identity.

The authors of the petition clearly resent the fact that the term ‘man’ still conveys positive attributes. It complains that Oxford’s definition of a ‘man’ is much more exhaustive than that of a ‘woman’ — with 25 examples for men, compared to only 5 for women. Implicit in this criticism is the aspiration to define man downwards.

Although the focus of the campaign is on challenging sexist language, it is actually about promoting a fundamental revision of the way people speak, behave and think about gender and sex.

This objective becomes clear in its demand to “enlarge the dictionary’s entry for ‘woman’,” as the petition puts it. To illustrate what the enlargement of the entry for “woman” means, it demands the inclusion of “examples representative of minorities, for example, a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, etc”. In other words it seeks to alter the meaning of woman by including men who identify as female in the definition.

Dictionaries have become an important site for the waging of the language wars. Campaigners are constantly placing pressure on dictionaries to include words that they like and censor those that they don’t.

A few years ago, a campaign sought to get the OED to remove its reference to “Essex Girls” on the ground that it was a lazy sexist stereotype. In this instance the OED stood its ground.

Trans activists have been more successful. In September 2019, Merriam-Webster dictionary announced that it will update the meaning of the pronoun “they” to “refer to a single person whose gender identity is non-binary”.

Not to be outdone, Collins Dictionary reported that it was adding the word “non-binary” to the dictionary. A few months later, Merriam-Webster declared that the non-binary pronoun “they” was their word of the year.

In their study, Forbidden words: taboo and censoring language, the authors Keith Allen and Kate Burridge stated that unlike normal censoring activities, which are aimed at the maintenance of the status quo, the current form of linguistic policing seeks to promote political and social change. Such campaigns are oriented towards the objective of altering how people behave and in particular how they identify themselves. For that reason their strategy of verbal purification is particularly directed towards influencing the socialisation of young people.

As the authors of the petition note, “we can take a serious step towards reducing the harm this is causing our young women and girls by looking at our language — and this starts with the dictionary”.

Unfortunately it does not end with the dictionary. In recent months, there has been a veritable explosion in the activities of the language police. To take one example, at Leicester University students who expected to celebrate International Women’s Day have discovered that instead the event has been rebranded as International Womxn Day. The university justified the the move by stating ‘‘We use the term ‘womxn’ as a more inclusive spelling of ‘women’ that includes any person who identifies as a womxn”. That’s another way of saying that the age-long the meaning of a woman has become the casualty of the Leicester University language police. How long before campaigners insist that womxn becomes Oxford Dictionary’s word of the year?

In his important essay, ‘Politics and the English Language’, George Orwell foresaw the corrosive impact of verbal purification on human life. He warned that:

“If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation even among people who should and do know better.”

At present, far too many people who do know better have opted for an easy life, and have acquiesced to the corruption of language. They need to realize that if we allow them to decide what words we can and cannot use, they will end up controlling our most intimate thoughts.

['Daniel Taylor'],"Due to the conflicting reports about the Coronavirus, it is difficult to discern the truth.

Mainstream media, and the establishment that props it up, has become so distrusted that a crisis of confidence is threatening to bring everything down.

Coronavirus is hitting the United States at a time of internal conflict and civil war at the highest levels of government.

What we can discern are a variety of mega-trends that at the very least point to a strong motive for a deliberate release of a man-made virus that could meet the goals of bad actors working against America and humanity at large.

At the very least – even if it turns out that mortality rates are low – Coronavirus is being used as a deadly economic and political weapon.

To begin, let’s take a look at some of the major trends and data points that have recently shaped the globe:

In 2017, the Pentagon initiated a study that assessed the threat of synthetic biology tech creating engineered biological weapons that are difficult to identify. As Wired magazine reported, this development “…could have implications for defensive strategies against a new type of bioweapon, potentially more difficult to identify because it resembles its “natural” counterpar t.”

t.” The fact that Coronavirus first appeared in China, an enemy of the United States, meant that the most authoritarian country on earth set the tone for how to respond to the outbreak, and initiated a coverup of the true nature of the virus.

Efforts to undermine President Trump’s successful presidency have so far failed. A persistent effort to sabotage both Trump and American success at large has been at work since before Trump was elected.

An overall move toward authoritarian globalism worldwide is meeting resistance. Populist movements are angering elites.

The medical industrial complex is experiencing a crisis of confidence, as revealed by recent comments from top scientists at the WHO Global Vaccine Safety Summit.

A pro-human philosophy for the future of mankind is gaining a foothold, threatening a long-established plan for technocratic rule.

Coronavirus is appearing at a critical point in human development. The technological revolution has the potential to lift up all of mankind, while overall confidence in the establishment is at an all time low as governments struggle to contain “empowered individuals“.

What better way to counter every single one of these developments than to release a pandemic virus on the globe?

When threatened with the prospect of a deadly virus, unprepared humans will quickly abandon any kind of morality or higher values in pursuit of the common good.

Deep state operatives (like George Soros) have already made moves to destabilize the United States.

Democrats have hoped for a global economic crisis to stop Trump from winning in 2020.

President Trump’s perceived inaction can be used against him if the virus is reported to be community spread on a large scale in the US.

Authoritarian rule, including Big Tech censorship of online speech, could be justified as a means to control the population.

The medical establishment can make a comeback with a vaccine to save the world from Coronavirus, utilizing the same synthetic biology technology that may have been used to create the virus.

The best response that informed individuals can take is to prepare as best we can while continuing to practice and promote virtues of freedom, self reliance, and Judeo Christian values that sustained the west during times of hardship in the past.

Make no mistake, America and Trump’s response could shape history.

,"Another day, and another piece of media is circulating the web that depicts a child in an uncomfortable situation. This time a drag queen dances suggestively for a small girl.

The video, uploaded on Tiktok, opens with a scantily clad male with his rear cheeks hanging out, crawling on hands and knees towards the child sitting in a chair. Taking on the air of a scene from a strip club, patrons of the restaurant clap and cheer. He then stands up with his short shorts, leaving little to the imagination, dances a bit, and then kneels next to the girl, as he says something to her while jiggling his booty. This most recent event is yet another incident in a long list of them that have occurred throughout the past couple years. Girls at Pride events have engaged with men partaking in pup-play. A child drag queen named “Lactatia” of all things, stood for a photo op next to a naked man. Another drag kid named Desmond danced on stage in female attire as men threw money his way. A sexual predator was caught reading to children during drag queen story time. And another drag queen reading during a library event flashed his crotch towards the entire room.

LGBT activists want you to believe this is not only normal, but that it’s a step in the right direction towards individual self-expression and queer acceptance. People within the media go so far as to tout drag kids as stunning and brave, and drag queen story time is pushed to the masses within progressive woke culture. But when it’s hard to tell the difference between child grooming tactics and progressiveness, a huge problem arises.

Here’s a drag queen dancing suggestively for a young girl while the adults look on and cheer pic.twitter.com/b4P5OLcPdE — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) February 28, 2020

What these people fail to realize is that they’re not helping LGBT causes. I refuse to believe that any rational person is looking at the current state of things and rooting it on. This belief is seemingly backed up by reactions online. The videos and images depicting events like those described above are met in large number by disgust. As previously reported on, even the videos of the drag children we’re led to believe are influential entities are greeted by downvotes and comments worried about their futures.

As an LGBT individual myself, this culture the left is permeating affects me greatly. With much of the media swaying towards the “progressive” side of things, the public sees queer people as depicted by the media elite, and how they’re choosing to show us is as nothing more than sexually deviant perverts who want to fondle your children.

I can attest that we’re not all like that, although, alarmingly, the people they’re highlighting are very much real, as are the reactions from the fringe left who clap it on. Watch the TikTok video and not a single adult has a horrid expression on their face. They’re cheering on a male sexually advancing on a young girl. I don’t know what this says about them, but it says nothing about me.

If that is what LGBT culture has become, I want nothing to do with it. I am ashamed to be associated with them, but death by association is not going to drag me down, because I denounce all of this, and I hope more level-headed people begin to speak up soon. For if they don’t, the resentment the left is creating towards gay people is only going to set us all backwards.

,"Following reports that a strange Christian cult might be behind the outbreak in Daegu that kickstarted South Korea’s COVID-19 crisis, readers around the world have been curious to learn more details about the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the small but surprisingly extensive church that follows a man named Lee Man-hee who claims to be the second coming of Jesus Christ.

Americans will recognize this as a similar concept to the Mormon theology. In South Korea, it’s one of several high-profile Christian cults with a doomsday-oriented philosophy (the leader of the Shincheonji will allegedly take thousands of followers with him to heaven when the world ends).

But in China, a cult like this is extremely illegal. Yet, somehow, in a state that’s constitutionally atheist, cults like this survive and sometimes flourish as it’s one of the few options that ordinary people have to do something genuinely subversive.

Churches like Shincheonji survive in a sort of tense standoff with the government, with scrutiny coming in waves. Typically, any kind of high profile attention would be bad for the church because it would rouse the authorities. In which case, the story that we’re about to share will likely be very, very bad for the church. But unfortunately for them the cat is already out of the bag.

The South China Morning Post has learned that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus has a branch in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak that is rocking the world right now.

And the paper has it on good authority that the church’s some 200 members in the city, most of whom are now in quarantine outside Wuhan, continued meeting even after the outbreak started to pick up steam.

One alleged member, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said in the beginning, nobody took the virus seriously – because authorities said it wasn’t serious.

“Rumours about a virus began to circulate in November but no one took them seriously,” said one member, a 28-year-old kindergarten teacher.

“I was in Wuhan in December when our church suspended all gatherings as soon as we learned about [the coronavirus],” said the woman, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.

As of Tuesday evening in the US, there were 977 confirmed cases in South Korea, the highest number outside China, as well as 11 deaths. Of the 84 new cases reported on Tuesday, more than half were reported in Daegu.

A pastor in Hubei province who spoke with SCMP said that Shincheonji church members were especially dedicated, and probably continued their missions to recruit during the outbreak.

Another alleged member of the church, identified only as a kingergarten teacher in Wuhan, said she was sure the church in Wuhan had nothing to do with the outbreaks in South Korea.

The Wuhan kindergarten teacher said she was confident that the recent mass outbreaks in South Korea were not linked to Shincheonji church members from the city.

“I don’t think the virus came from us because none of our brothers and sisters in Wuhan have been infected. I don’t know about members in other places but at least we are clean. None of us have reported sick,” she said.

“There are so many Chinese travelling to South Korea, it’s quite unfair to pin [the disease] on us.”

However, she can’t prove this.

She sidestepped questions on whether church members had travelled from Wuhan to South Korea after the outbreak.

A spokesman for the church told SCMP that the group has had troubles with the Chinese authorities before, and that they would do anything to avoid any undue scrutiny connected to the virus, which they stressed had nothing to do with the church.

The teacher said that in 2018 the Wuhan group’s “holy temple” in Hankou district had been raided by police “who branded us a cult,” but members continued to worship in small groups.

“We are aware of all the negative reporting out there after the outbreak in South Korea, but we do not want to defend ourselves in public because that will create trouble with the government,” she said. “We just want to get through the crisis first.”

We wonder if Chinese authorities will see things the same way?

The promised transparency soon evaporated, however, with Home Office bureaucrats deciding that the report would in fact remain “internal” — and top-level politicians and parliamentarians representing constituencies plagued by grooming gangs questioning whether a real investigation was even carried out.

Now attempts by the left-wing Independent news website to have the report disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act have foundered, with the Home Office, now led by Priti Patel, insisting it is not in “the public interest”.

Douglas Golden']","It's abundantly clear now that the Obama administration tried to torpedo Donald Trump, first as a candidate and then as president-elect, using a Democratic Party-funded ""dossier"" of Russian propaganda to obtain warrants to spy on Trump's campaign.

But talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh says the Obama administration went even further, by planting ""moles"" throughout the federal bureaucracy to undermine Trump.

He noted Tuesday that Barack Obama grew the National Security Council staff from about 100 employees to well over 200.

Trump didn't immediately fire the extraneous workers when he took office.

Among Obama's hires were the Vindman brothers, one of whom testified against Trump in the House impeachment investigation. Another was Eric Ciaramella, the reported whistleblower whose hearsay claim triggered the Democrats' impeachment campaign. And there was Sean Misko, who was heard plotting with Ciaramella to bring down Trump just weeks after the inauguration. Misko then went to work for the lead impeachment manager, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

""And then you remember how Obama multiplied the number of federal agencies who had access to classified data? I think what this actually was… I think as Obama was leaving office, he expanded the National Security Council staff and then enlarged the number of agencies that had access to whatever classified data they did. He planted moles,"" Limbaugh said.

""This is where they planted the moles. This is where they planted the moles all over the NSC. The Vindman twins, Fiona Hill, the whistleblower, Abigail Grace (who left the NSC shortly after the Trump phone call). She went to work for Schiff. So did Sean Misko. Every one of these people is an Obama holdover. I remember asking, 'Why in the hell are they still there? Why didn’t Trump clean house and reduce this number back down to 75 to a hundred people who are working for him?' I don’t know the answer.

""But my guess would be that he had people advising him not to do it,"" he said.

""But I think that's where all of this came from. I think it's where the Trump-Russia collusion and all of this came from, the FBI and that element of it, too. But the inside Trump administration moles, the turncoats, whatever you want to call 'em. They are Obama appointees that had jobs expanded as Obama was leaving office for the express purpose of protecting Obama's achievements and sabotaging whoever was to come next — in this case, Trump,"" he said.

He said the ""garbage coming out of these NSC people and the leaks"" was possibly the most damaging to Trump.

Mohammed Ibrahim, 34, is believed to have attacked police officers with bladed weapons before killing at least two people in a rampage that spanned miles across the city.

After approaching two officers at a rail station, Ibrahim reportedly slashed one in the face and arm before escaping and hopping a train.

“At about 11:15 pm, he started talking with two women – aged 30 and 31 – getting out of their vehicle at Coppin Grove before stabbing them. The 30-year-old victim died at the scene,” 9 News reports. “Police were then called to reports of a man stabbed near a tram stop in Kew about 12:15 am.”

“That man, 59, died in hospital, while the offender was spotted by police a few hundred metres away, in Walton Street.”

Ibrahim was reportedly shot dead by police during an attempted arrest.

Ibrahim had visited multiple police stations in 2018, claiming a local ISIS cell was “out to kill him,” according to 9 News.

Up to 500 illegal migrants marched to a border crossing linking Kelebia, Serbia, and Tompa, Hungary, as part of an action coined 'Abroon Caravan.'

The demonstration was reportedly coordinated ahead of time in private social media groups, but details and a list of instructions to marchers were leaked to authorities and media.

“In a leaked letter, the organizers also pointed out that the international media would be present in large numbers, so that news of the demonstration would spread quickly and that the images would be visible to the world in minutes or hours,"" Hungarian outlet Kuruc reports. ""All these signs suggest that a non-governmental organization may be behind the organization of the migrant caravan.”

'Humanitarian groups,' such as Doctors Without Borders, distributed blankets and tents to migrants who planned to camp at the border, according to Hirado.

Some migrants sat on the ground with flowers in their laps, while others held signs reading, ""Our children deserve better life,” ""Let us go through in peace,” and “We are refugees, not criminals.”

Women and children in the group – which Kuruc referred to as ""Trojan horses"" – were prominently featured in an effort to garner emotional leverage.

""According to security policy experts, migrants are hoping that the presence of women and children will lead them to cross the border,"" Hirado reports.

However, the group was comprised mostly of young men, as M1 correspondent Malya Lilla explained during a live television broadcast, saying the few children present were presented as tokens of ""peace.""

During the evening, children were reportedly brought to the border fence and instructed to “chant and appeal to the hearts of the border guards on duty.”

Hungarian police ordered the border crossing closed indefinitely, directing all traffic to alternate crossings.

After midnight, hundreds of Serbian police officers moved in and gathered the migrants onto waiting buses and returned them to asylum centers within Serbia.

Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin vowed illegal migrants would not be allowed to ""disrupt good neighborly relations between Serbia and Hungary.""

That’s nothing terribly new, but where they plan to place it is.

The new statue will feature President Barack Obama seated in a large chair in a scene very similar to that of Lincoln at his place of honor. And if that weren’t bad enough, the communist representative, Martin, has successfully led a campaign to have the Obama figure share space with Lincoln at his memorial. The tasty snack of a commie explained this decision:

“Ha ha! The two figures look almost exactly the same. Both settled in their big thrones, staring out intensely. That’s probably the main reason. They are like matching bookends. But there is also their legacy to consider. Lincoln, of course, freed the slaves. The emancipation proclamation. It was good stuff. And Obama showed us all how slavery still exists here in the USA and he spent eight years trying to bring it to an end for real. Obama was like the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln, but that’s a whole other story.”

The communist have gone off the deep end. They’re suggesting that Obama was just like one of the greatest Republicans of all time, President Lincoln. This is a blasphemy that must not be tolerated.

First, the White House has to file impeachment papers in court, which RUDY GIULIANI DID already. Next, the Conference of American Governors has to enter a supermajority vote of “no confidence” in the public record.

This morning, that vote was entered as 2 Democrats joined 30 Republicans in securing the needed numbers. The vote will be recorded by the Secretary of State and delivered to the Senate for the third and final step in the impeachment process.

New Hampshire Lieutenant Governor Art Tubolls said it was “awe-inspiring” to be a part of such a historic event:

“Nobody has ever come close to impeaching a Speaker before. The Constitution makes it very difficult, since she is literally considered the voice of the people. Now, we get to use whatever narrative we like to move forward to a trial in the Senate. Pick one: She’s a drunk. She’s a criminal. Her daughters are criminals. She’s a member of the Deep State. There are 20 reasons to impeach her. All we need now is one.”

Once the vote of the Governors reaches Mitch McConnell, he’ll have 10 days to initiate a trial for impeachment. Rumor has it they’re already building their case and that Giuliani and Dershowitz will be the legal minds arguing the case. That spells disaster for Pelosi.

They intend to screw over our greatest generation by removing from them everything that we have earned over the years. They do not work for the betterment of the nation. They only look out for themselves.

The two held a joint press conference yesterday to announce their intention to remove from senior citizens what they termed “entitlements“, such as Social Security and Medicare. Omar showed her lack of class and understanding of how America works when she stepped up to the microphone.

“America is for the young. It is the youth of this country that work to make it great. They are productive and tax paying. They contribute…..unlike our senior citizens who only take. Retirees are dead weight.”

That speech spoke to Omar’s inability or unwillingness to assimilate to American culture. In Somalia, where she is from, seniors are exiled and left to fend for themselves in the jungle, where they soon perish. It seems she wants the same to happen here.

Cortez, of course, had to put in her two cents, which is all her mind is worth :

“In socialism, we work for the good of the collective. The whole matters more than the individual. People make sacrifices. Social Security and Medicare cost America tens of billions of dollars every year. And for what? Fora bunch of deadbeats with nothing left to give. That money would be far better spent on low income housing and welfare for the young people of America who just need a leg up.”

Bacon. The pork product bagel sandwiches are built on. The staple of the American soldier, and the most recognizable smell at Shoney’s breakfast buffet.

Unfortunately, we know that this is just another case of Musslamic Shakira Law in action. The Quaran says:

“Only the American Infidel Eats Bacon, and he Shall Pay the Ultimate Price Before Allahu.”

That sounds like a threat, doesn’t it? It says that. I swear.

Omar’s people put out a statement that walked back her attack on bacon a bit:

“No…you idiots. We should consider rethinking how much we eat for our own health and ‘yous wants to take mah baconz’ are two completely different things.

The thought is the older vehicles no longer pass EPA and CARB emissions requirements to operate within the state.

CARB and California lead the nation in emissions controls, and what California does, the rest of the United States generally follows. The same type

of law was passed for freight hauling semi trucks to curb air pollution brought on by emissions. In 2004 California said by this year all semis 2010 and older may not operate in the state.

Now the state is taking it even further, by refusing to register any vehicle manufactured before January 1, 2000. This move can hurt Americans living on a tight budget who may not be able to afford newer cars. Sandy Batt, resident of Apple Valley, is worried. “I drive a 1972 Ford Pinto, I’ve had this car since 2017, yeah it breaks down constantly and isn’t very safe but I can hide that I’m drinking a beer in it”.

What California does, the nation follows. Millions of old, broken down pieces of junk may have to be placed out of service and people are not happy. Joseph Barron, of White Hairs, New Jersey, owns a 1985 Chevy Silverado. “This truck burns oil and smokes like a factory, but it’s cool to me” he said, sucking on a cheap cigar and dusting off his Trump 2020 hat. “I ain’t about to let some damned commie in California tell me to drive a safe truck!”

The biggest concern amongst the owners of older cars and trucks is the financial obligation of a payment every month, and even worse, car insurance. A 2018 study showed that most people who own jalopies haven’t held car insurance in years. Why insure it when it cost more than the car is worth?

PHILADELPHIA, PA

Former President Barack Obama announced late last night that he had filed for divorce from his wife of 27 years, Michelle Obama, after he revealed a secret double life as a homosexual.

“It is with a bit of sadness and a whole lot of relief that I announce that Michelle and I have decided to separate, as I have admitted to her, as I’m doing now to the rest of the world, that I am a homosexual,” said Barack Obama. “This may come as a shock to many, and anger others, but this is my personal business, and I would hope that everyone could respect my privacy at this time”

Representatives for Michelle Obama said that she and the former president would split amicably, and that Michelle herself was “not particularly shocked” by the revelation.

“We are very close, as close as two people could ever be, really,” said Michelle in a prepared statement. “I’ve known for many years about Barack’s secret life, and I fully support him in the direction that his life takes him. He was and is an incredible leader, a loving father and family man, and now he can go on to make some other guy, or multiple guys, very happy.”

“Honestly, I was prepared to just stay with her,” said Barack. “I think she’s secretly know for years that I was gay, and since it already came out in every conservative news site years ago that Michelle was actually born a man, I figured that was close enough. I was prepared to stick it out and keep having young guys on the side. Michelle nixed it, though. She said if this was going to become public news, then there’s no reason we shouldn’t just split up and reveal our true selves. Whoops, I guess I just proved those rumors about her secret to be true, too. Damn, sorry Michelle!”

Representatives for the Obama children, Malia and Sasha, could not be reached for comment, but their Facebook pages both were vacant of any comments on the split.

PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico

Jeffrey Epstein, the man once thought capable of bringing down multiple governments with insider information about his immense pedophila ring and sex island, was reportedly seen alive in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico early this morning. A tourist visiting the area from Atlanta said they recognized him immediately.

“I was kind of shook, it was like seeing a ghost,” said the tourist, who wished to remain anonymous. “His murder – er, I mean, his suicide – was pretty much the biggest story of 2019 before it got swept away by the media. I’ve seen the guy’s face so many times on the news and on social media in memes, there’s no way I was mistaken.”

Another reported sighting of Epstein came only 3 hours later, and police were notified.

“Honestly, you’d think after they faked his death, he’d go somewhere a little more remote than a resort in Mexico,” said Carl Richards, who is vacationing in the area while going through a bitter divorce. “I came down here to relax and stop thinking about my bitch ex-wife, but now I think it’s time to go. If Epstein is here, and this news is breaking out, it won’t be long before the place is overrun with paparazzi.”

A single photo was taken by the anonymous person who first viewed Epstein as he exited a Puerto Vallarta hotel.

“I wanted to get closer, but I didn’t want to spook him,” said the source. “The picture is horrible, but I ended up walking right past him. It’s definitely Epstein.”

NEW YORK CITY, NY –

President Trump was arrested by the NYC Police Department while exiting his former residence at Trump Tower on Sunday morning, according to reports from the Associated Press.

Police Chief Mario Brann said that his officers were acting on an open warrant from 1998, when Trump allegedly struck a pedestrian while driving through the city, and left the scene. The pedestrian, whose name was not released, later died of their injuries.

“It is with great pleasure that I announce that we have taken President Donald Trump into custody for his role in the death of a young man in 1998,” said Chief Brann. “Mr. Trump is alleged to have killed the victim in a hit-and-run accident, for which he had never been charged. That changes today.”

Lawyers for President Trump say that the charges are “absolutely ridiculous” and “totally absurd.”

“There is no way that he was driving through the streets of New York and killed someone,” said Richard Moorehouse, a private attorney retained by the president. “President Trump cannot drive. The guy can barely navigate a golf course in a golf cart, you think he has ever learned to drive an actual car? He’s a total moron. Nobody would let him behind the wheel. If this accident occurred as they say, then we attest that Mr. Trump had a driver at the time, and he is not guilty of anything.”

“I’ve heard of people pleading insanity, but I’ve never heard of anyone pleading total idiocy to get out of a crime before,” said Chief Brann. “I am intrigued to see how this plays out. Either way, this gives everyone a break from Trump’s stupid goddamn tweets for a few hours.”

LOS ANGELES, California –

Gremlins star Gizmo has filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles superior court against Disney over their latest viral property, “Baby Yoda,” also known as The Child, from the hit Disney+ series The Mandalorian. Gizmo claims that Disney stole his likeness when they created the cute, cuddly character.

“My client is clearly the basis for the new Disney character affectionately known as Baby Yoda, and designers at Disney knew exactly what they were doing when they developed The Child’s final form,” said lawyer Chris Dante, who is representing Gizmo. “We are seeking damages for the extreme distress, loss of work, and emotional turmoil that Baby Yoda has caused my client. I am confident we have a strong case.”

Lawyers for Disney could not be reached for comment, but an anonymous employee who works on The Mandalorian said that there were draft notes that indicated Disney executives “very much” wanted to have a new character that “was 50% Yoda, 50% Gizmo, and 100% adorable.”

Gizmo first rose to fame in 1984 with his starring role in the Christmas-themed horror film Gremilins.

PHILADELPHIA, PA –

Michelle Obama, the wife of former president Barack Obama, has announced that she will be running for president in the 2020 election.

“I know I’m a lot later than most people, but to be honest, there’s no reason to start running 2 years before the election,” said Michelle Obama from the family home in Philadelphia. “It’s much easier to wait until the ‘little people’ drop out, and we can see what’s left of the field. At this point, the field is pretty bland, so I’m going to come in and mow it down.”

Obama, who was highly involved in education and children’s health during her husband’s two terms, says that she plans to continue her advocacy for the young people of America.

“Kids are our future, and education and health are the most important things for the next generation,” said Obama. “I have no stance at all on foreign policy, taxes, abortion, religion, or literally anything else. My platform is the children, and between that and my name, I think I have a great shot of becoming the Democratic nominee, and our next president.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

Earlier this week, President Trump illegally ordered the assassination of a top military general in Iran, Qasem Soleimani, prompting Iran to promise a swift revenge. In the imminent face of war with a powerful military in Iran, President Trump reinstated the United States draft, last used during the Vietnam Conflict.

“There are a lot of incredible, selfless American men and women who have been serving in the armed forces, some for many years, some still in basic training,” stated President Trump early this morning from the Oval Office. “These people, they need help. They need a lot of really, really big help, and we need to make sure they receive it. Reinstating the United States draft process is the easiest, and most logical answer.”

The draft process, which chooses young, American men at random to enlist in the armed forces, is something most people thought they would never see used again, but military officials agree with Trump that it’s the most efficient way to quickly build our military forces in the face of danger.

“When you anger another country by committing a blatant and completely illegal war crime, such as the case with our President’s attack in Iran, things heat up quickly, and action must be taken,” said Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. “We are ready to have our young men suit up and join our military forces, and the reinstatement of the draft will help immensely.”

“It’s about time these lazy millennials do something with their life other than eat Tide pods and watch YouTube videos,” said MAGA-hat wearing, Trump voter Carl Richards, 42, from Atlanta. “They could use the direction, the discipline, and should want to fight to protect our country from foreign invasion. It’s what I would have done when I was their age. Not doing it now, of course. Got myself some really tender soles, and I can’t walk for too long before my feet really start to hurt. If it wasn’t for that, I’d be out there signing up to shoot me some towelheads or whoever it is this time.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump announced earlier this morning via Twitter that he would be legalizing marijuana on a federal level, which would automatically lift restrictions in every state, even those that have yet to set up legalization and retail options.

“At this point, there’s really no reason to continue classifying it as a Schedule 1 drug,” tweeted President Trump. “Everyone smokes it, or eats it in delicious little pastries and candies. Frankly, edibles are the only reason I can sleep at night myself. It’s been a long battle with wasted trillions of dollars, and I want it to stop.”

The President went on to say that the influx of tax revenue at the state and federal levels would be astronomical.

“Colorado can buy whatever they want, because it’s huge out there,” said Trump. “They can pay for education, healthcare, new roads, whatever. They can do that because of weed taxes. This is going to make the American people rich. Now we will be able to start building that wall!”

STAMFORD, CT –

WWE CEO and Chairman Vince McMahon announced today that he had met with Tony Khan, the owner of new wrestling promotion AEW, and that the two had agreed on a purchase amount, with McMahon becoming sole owner.

“When I saw the kind of wrestling that these guys were doing, the matches they were putting on, the crowd reactions – I knew that this was something big, and I had to get involved,” said McMahon. “If I didn’t try to take control of this company now, they’d likely have overshadowed the WWE within a few years, maybe less. I am too old for more Monday Night Wars.”

McMahon is referencing the fan’s term for the ratings battle between the WWE and the then Ted Turner owned WCW. During the mid-90s, the two companies went head to head on Monday evenings in prime time TV slots. When WWE eventually took control of the ratings, McMahon bought out WCW and folded the entire promotion.

“When McMahon approached me, I laughed at first,” said Tony Khan, a billionaire whose family has long ties in the world of sports. “But he came in with a price that was just outrageous, and I would have been a fool to say no. Yes, I’m worth upwards of 4 times what the WWE is worth, but I didn’t get that way by being a fool. I’m a wrestling fan, and I love what we’re doing, but WWE can take what we’re doing and amp it up globally overnight.”

On news of the purchase, AEW’s Executive Vice President, Cody Rhodes, simply said “Fuck. Not again.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump announced today that he and Mexican President Andres Manual Lopez came to an agreement about the border wall “fiasco,” and that Mexico has finally agreed to pay for the Wall, in exchange for the return of Texas to the southern country.

“This is a great deal for us, one of the biggest and best deals in our country’s history, and I can honestly say, it was, in fact, a great deal because I made it,” said President Trump. “I only make good deals, and this deal is by far one of the greatest deals ever made.”

Experts say that the cost of the border wall will be somewhere in the nature of $500 billion, and President Trump says that he is “more than fine” with that trade off in exchange for the state of Texas.

“As a great man once said, only steers and queers come from Texas, and I don’t care about either of those things at all,” said President Trump. “Except of course in regards to my great VP Mike Pence, but he’s not a Texan queer, just a regular one, so it’s okay.”

VATICAN CITY –

Pope Francis made a surprise announcement during his weekly Sunday Mass in Vatican City, stunning the world when he said that the church has decided that their priests would be allowed to wed, something that has never been allowed in the history of the Catholic Church.

“In an effort to stop our wonderful men of the cloth from molesting any more children, we have decided to allow them to marry and fornicate with women,” said Francis. “This will hopefully put an end, once and for all, to the bad behavior of some of our flock.”

Despite the announcement taking place earlier this morning, there has been no word on whether any priests have elected to look for a wife, or if they’re content with their current arrangement of molesting children for years, having the church pay hush money, and being moved to a new location after all the news is buried.

CARSON, Georgia –

A Georgia man has filed suit against tech giant Apple, saying that after purchasing the latest iPhone, he tried to “eat the device,” and suffered severe damage to his mouth, teeth, and gums.

“My client thought that because the item was an ‘Apple,’ device, that it would be edible as apples generally are,” said Dewey Cheatum, Esq., the attorney representing the unnamed man who engaged in the lawsuit. “We believe we have a very strong case, as Apple does not now, nor have they ever said that their items could not be eaten.”

Apple’s public response to the lawsuit was to have Tim Cook shit directly onto the portfolio, before mailing it back to the office of Cheatum with a note that said “go fuck yourself.”

ATLANTA, Georgia –

Richard Atkins, 64, has been in a coma for the last 26 years, the result of a hit-and-run car accident that left him hospitalized. Although doctors had told Atkins’ wife, Miranda, that they believed if he ever woke up that Richard would be a complete “vegetable,” Miranda decided not to pull the plug.

“I’m so glad I listened to my gut, I knew he’d wake up eventually,” said Miranda. “I am concerned about his choice to be put back under though.”

Doctors were flabbergasted that Atkins woke up last Tuesday morning, cracking jokes and asking for lunch.

“He is a marvel of the medical world, that’s for sure,” said Dr. Francis Joseph. “I’ve been treating Atkins as his doctor for the last 20 years of his 26 years in a comatose state, and I never expected this. He woke up, was fine, and didn’t seemed at all bothered he’d been in a coma for nearly 3 decades. In fact, he asked to be put back under for another year so he’d be eligible for his social security and retirement benefits.”

Doctors say that they initially declined to give in to Atkins’ request, but eventually were persuaded.

“I told them that I had memories of being sexually abused while in my coma by hospital staff,” said Atkins before they put him back under. “Don’t tell anyone that it was total crap, I don’t remember a thing. I just don’t want to work again. Work sucks.”

ATLANTA, Georgia –

In a press release from Planned Parenthood, the non-profit company announced today that they would be ceasing to perform any abortions at any of their clinics throughout the country. The reason, they say, is not because of increased pressure from religious groups or right-wing nutjobs, but because they just really are sick of it being their “sole focus” in the media.

“We do so many amazing things for women, and for families in genera,” said Planned Parenthood CEO Marge Brock. “All anyone ever talks about is ‘gee, do you know how many abortions the perform,’ and that sort of thing. Frankly, it’s taking away all the resources of our other services, and we don’t have time to bother.”

Brock says that they will continue to council women on where they can get safe, medically performed abortions should they ask, but they won’t do anything in their facilities.

“We think this change will be great, and allow us to let people know about all the good we do,” said Brock. “Maybe now all these assholes will stop standing outside our offices with badly written signs and hatred, and they can go back to the internet where trolls belong.”

President Trump signed a new order today, removing marijuana from the list of schedule-1 drugs, opening the floodgates for the drug to become legal on a federal level.

“I’ve always been against drinking, because alcoholism killed someone very close to me,” said President Trump. “But that said, I’ve always been a big fan of smoking the ganj. In fact, it was while I was baked out of my mind with a couple of friends that I first thought to run for President, and now – well, here I am.”

President Trump said that with the increased tax revenue from the sale of marijuana nationwide, he hopes to build the border wall.

“Honestly, legalizing on a federal level will bring in trillons of dollars for this country. It will boost the economy and the government will be flooded with new monies,” said Trump. “I will have my wall built by the end of the year.”

In a shocking move, Michelle Obama says she is ready to begin campaigning for a shot at the White House in 2020. The announcement comes after several months of speculation, but with Michelle always saying it wasn’t going to happen. The news also includes a shocking running mate – Michelle’s husband, former President Barack Obama.

“We had to look into the legalities a lot, because we were not 100% sure it could happen, but it turns out, everything is in order,” said Michelle Obama in a statement. “Barack finished his two terms as elected President, but would be allowed to serve two more terms as Vice President, were he able to get elected with a running mate who is eligible for the office. I believe I’m more than qualified for the job.”

When questioned about the issue, though, that if something were to happen to her after election, Barack would become President for a third term, Michelle smiled slyly.

“Yes, well…you do never know what the future holds,” she said.

President Trump says he is beginning the preparations for deporting his wife, Melania, back to “whatever third world shithole she comes from,” according to official White House documents.

According to reports, Melania and President Trump had a bitter argument in the middle of the Oval Office, although the stories differ as to what caused the argument in the first place, with most sources stating that President Trump dislikes being referred to be his wife as “President Cheeto.”

“Frankly, I think it’s a sweet term of endearment from a wife to her husband,” said one anonymous staffer. “He really is taking it the wrong way. Now, of course, when she refers to his penis as the President’s ‘little Cheeto Puff,’ that might be crossing a line. But still – they’re married, you’re supposed to work these things out.”

President Trump said that he has been married enough times in his life, that “ditching one more won’t make much of a dent” in his life.

A large group of concerned parents say they are extremely disappointed in the lack of drugs found mixed into their children’s bags after trick-or-treating this year. They say the issue comes because of the scare-tactic posts and “clickbait bullshit” articles they’ve seen posted on their social media pages.

“Frankly, I was a little upset that Johnny only came home with a bag of candy, and there were no nugs of weed or gummy bears laced with ecstasy mixed in,” said Maria Jones, 38. “With all the articles you see floating around every year, and especially this year, I really expected something good to be in the bag. It’s a huge letdown.”

“Frankly, I blame the junkies for all of this,” said Chris Richards, 29. “We have an increased amount of avid drug users in this city, and so many people are using, there’s just nothing left to give the kids anymore during Halloween. It really sucks. My 7-year-old is pleased as shit about the M&Ms, but where’s my MDMA?!”

City officials say that this Halloween, like every Halloween throughout history, went off without a hitch, and there were no reported razor blades, needles, or drugs given out during the city’s trick-or-treating.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump has reportedly offered comedian Bill Cosby a full pardon, after the fallen star was found guilty of sexual assault and sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison. Cosby, who is a lifelong friend of President Trump, could have spent his final days in prison had Trump not stepped in.

“Bill is absolutely and without a doubt, innocent on all charges,” said President Trump. “I understand very well how our court system works. I probably understand better than anyone, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is that I have met with Bill, we have spoken at length about the accusations against him, and I don’t believe a word of them.”

Over 60 women came forward to say that Bill Cosby had assaulted them, with many being drugged and raped while unconscious.

“We all know women like to gab, and this is a perfect example of why I plan to lower the crimes associated with assault or rape,” said Trump. “It’s obvious in this case that Bill had consensual sex with a woman who later regretted it, and then accused him of rape. Afterwards, of course, dozens of other women knew they could also try and make a dime off the publicity, and accused him as well. It’s sickening – truly sick – how some people think.”

Cosby, 81, will be allowed to leave prison on Monday as soon as the pardon is signed.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump said this morning during a press conference that the “MeToo movement has gone too far,” and that “too many honest, hardworking men are being thrown under the bus with lies and malicious intent,” and that he plans to spend the rest of his time in office working to reduce the severity of rape and sexual assault charges.

“In this world that we live, many men are having their lives ruined by false allegations and exaggerated claims, and it’s time to put a stop to it,” said President Trump. “I myself have been wrongly accused of sexual assault, as have many of my close friends, and it’s sickening. It’s terrifying to live as a man right now, and know that at any time, some woman who you may not even know could come forward and say that you forcibly kissed her, or groped her, or that you offered her money to sit on your face, and it could ruin your life. It’s disgusting behavior on the part of these women.”

Trump went on to say that he felt that the transgressions of young men, if they happen at all, should be forgotten or pushed aside based on the work they’ve done and accomplished in the years since.

“I will not comment publicly on whether or not I believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted anyone, even though we all clearly know that he didn’t,” said President Trump. “What I do know is that the accusations are destroying him and his family, and that’s not right. It’s for MeToo to go away quietly.”

President Trump said that he hopes to pass new laws that would decrease the criminal statute that would imprison people like Bill Cosby, who was sentenced to 3-10 years for sexual assault, and instead would allow men who are found guilty to pay a sort of fine, or restitution to the plaintiff.

“It is my hope that my son can grow up in a world where no woman will ever accuse him of touching her inappropriately, whether he did or not,” said Trump. “I want to keep Making America Great Again, and at this point, this is my number one concern.”

Brett Kavanaugh, who is currently under scrutiny for allegedly sexually assaulting several women decades ago while drunk in high school, was arrested last night after police were called to local Washington, D.C. dive bar Good Head.

Kavanaugh, who is trying to obtain a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, was reportedly detained by security after he allegedly removed his penis from his pants, and begin vigorously masturbating in the busy bar, before urinating all over himself, falling into the fetal position, and crying.

“When we arrived, Mr. Kavanaugh was beyond drunk, which from recent news reports, is perfectly in line with what we know about him,” said police chief Mario Lewis. “When we tried to detain him, Mr. Kavanaugh became unruly and violent, and assaulted two of my officers. A third officer was able to tase Mr. Kavanaugh before he caused any more harm or began masturbating again.”

Bystanders say that police had to physically carry Kavanaugh from the bar, and that he was screaming and yelling and snarling the entire time. Kavanaugh was held overnight, and released on $20,000 bail.

A police office in Australia was hospitalized with several injuries after he was beaten and sexually assaulted by a wild kangaroo during the course of duty, reports Canberra newspaper The Canberra Times.

Via World News Daily Report:

The attack occurred at 2 am yesterday after police officers responded to residents who were alarmed by an intruder on their property.

Police officers arrived on the scene to find an extremely aggressive kangaroo and attempted to scare away the animal, without success.

“He jumped on my partner, kicked him unconscious to the floor and started humping him and attempted to mate with him,” Constable Pete Turnbull told reporters.

Constable Malcolm Rudd suffered from two cuts and a black eye as well as multiple concussions to the head after the kangaroo in heat attempted to mate with the officer’s head.

“He was humping and rubbing his penis all over my partner’s face in a brutal fashion. I had to tase the animal or else he would have killed him” Constable Pete Turnbull explained, visibly emotional.

It took several minutes before Constable Turnbull realized that his partner was in trouble as he was dealing with the residents who had called during the assault.

“When he was lying unconscious on the ground, it was dark and I thought his head was covered in blood. Thankfully, it was mostly kangaroo sperm,” Constable Turnbull told reporters in relief.

PALO ALTO, California –

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced that he will be stepping down from the company, after allegations that he orchestrated his team to steal private information from site users, and resold it for millions.

“While I can neither confirm nor deny that I was a part of the stolen user data, it happened on my watch as CEO, and that’s not right,” said Zuckerberg. “Effective immediately, I am stepping down as the CEO of Facebook.”

When asked what his next plans were, Zuck was initially shy about answering, but was eventually persuaded to admit that he had his ambitions set on running the country in place of Facebook.

“Realistically, I was already running the country anyway,” said Zuckerberg. “Do you know anyone who isn’t on Facebook? Exactly. When you run the biggest website in the world that billions log onto every day, you’re basically running things, if you understand what I mean.”

Zuckerberg has not officially announced his candidacy, but sources close to him say he is “absolutely” planning a run in 2020.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Donald Trump has reportedly offered Roseanne Barr a job in his cabinet at the White House, after ABC fired Roseanne and cancelled her sitcom over racist tweets made by the comedian. President Trump says that he “feels horrible” for the TV star, and says that there is “absolutely a job” for her in the White House.

“Roseanne is a national treasure, and is loved by many,” said President Trump. “Her tweets were her own thoughts, which were shared by many people across this great nation. I, for one, believe that she deserves another chance, and as such, will be allowing her to be the chairperson of a new position I’m creating in the White House – Director of Race Relations.”

If Roseanne decides to take the job, she will be in charge of working with people of all different races throughout the country in trying to “smooth over” issues between them.

“This will include teaching black people not to shoot and rob each other, teaching Mexicans how to wear deodorant in public, that sort of thing,” said President Trump. “I absolutely believe that Roseanne is the perfect person for this job.”

LOS ANGELES, California –

Earlier this morning, ABC Networks, which are owned by Disney, dumped the hit TV revival of Roseanne, announcing their would be no second season because of a series of racist tweets by star and creator, Roseanne Barr.

Roseanne tweeted inappropriate comments comparing a former member of Barack Obama’s staff to an ape – among other insane comments bashing Muslims and Hillary supporters.

Despite the backlash, Netflix has announced that they will “gladly” pick-up the cancelled series for continuation.

“We have no problems with what Roseanne said in her tweets – those are her personal opinions, and they have nothing to do with making money, which she is very, very good at,” said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. “ABC hadn’t seen numbers like hers in years, and they were absolutely stupid to dump it while she’s still hot. We have already decided to add Roseanne to our platform, and know that our viewers will be ecstatic.

Although parts of the new season were already shot before the show was cancelled, there were no completed episodes, and Hastings has said they will start from scratch, but that viewers will be “very excited” by the changes.

“For starters, we want to push it to a TV-MA rating, which we think is more real, and will connect more with viewers,” said Hastings. “But we have some other changes as well, it’s all very early in talks, but it’s happening. We don’t care at all about Roseanne herself being a racist pig, we just want to offer the best programming available.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

For those hoping to see Bill Cosby serve an extended prison sentence where he would likely end up dying, you may have to keep waiting.

This afternoon, when Trump was asked about his thoughts on Bill Cosby’s verdict, the President stated that he would be “completely pardoning” the fallen comedian.

“Regardless of what that jury thinks, or what anyone thinks, Bill Cosby has always been America’s dad – and America’s dad would never sexually assault and drug all those women,” said President Trump. “As soon as he is officially sentenced, I will be offering Mr. Cosby a full pardon, and the apology of the U.S. justice system. The fact that he has been found guilty is sickening.”

Trump, who has been accused by many, many women of also being a sexual predator, states that pardoning Cosby has “nothing to do” with his own conscience, and everything to do with “writing a serious wrong.”

“I love Bill Cosby, I loved The Cosby Show, and I love Jello Pudding,” said President Trump. “If you cannot get behind those things as well, then I don’t know how you can even call yourself an American.”

CHAPPAQUA, New York –

According to reports circulating this evening, Hillary Clinton has been killed after an FBI raid on her home went south, and agents were forced to open fire.

“When we entered the home, we anticipated that there would be no issues, no problems,” said FBI raid coordinator Chris Thompson. “What we found was Hillary screaming at us to ‘get the fuck out’ of her house. When we insisted we had a warrant, she brandished a shotgun at us, and my men were forced to put her down.”

More details on the events will be released as they are announced.

VATICAN CITY –

Pope Francis committed what many are calling a “mortal sin,” but at the very least is something of a faux pas, after he accidentally held up a copy of the vintage porn magazine Beaver instead of his bible during Mass in Vatican City.

“The Pope was very tired that day, and didn’t realize that he had picked up the wrong item,” said Vatican spokesperson Cardinal John Devoux. “His mistake was quickly noted, and he threw the magazine away, and continued with his sermon.”

Although Pope Francis has not personally acknowledged the incident, the Vatican has admitted that they do not know how the magazine came to be in the possession of the Church, or why it was nearby during the Pope’s Mass.

The issue, which was photographed being held up by Pope Francis, is over 20 years old.

PITTSBURGH, PA –

Police are reporting that comedian, actor, and convicted rapist Bill Cosby has been found dead in his home of an apparent suicide. Medical reports indicate that he took his entire stash of roofies, and collapsed due to cardiac arrest.

“Mr. Cosby, as we all know very well now, was a rapist who enjoyed drugging women and sexually assaulting them,” said Police Captain Phil Huxtable of the PA County Sheriff’s Department. “It appears that in an effort to avoid a prison sentence, one where he no doubt would have stayed until he died, he decided to take his own life by resorting to ‘hitting off his own stash,’ as it were.”

Cpt. Huxtable says that Cosby likely took over 150 Rohpynol pills, often called “roofies” or the “date rape drug.” These are also likely the same pills that Cosby used to drug and rape dozens and dozens and dozens of women over the years. He was found guilty earlier this week of 3 counts of sexual assault. Each count had a maximum sentence of 10 years, and individual fines of $25,000 per offense.

Secret, closed door negotiations have finally been made public after an agreement was reached by the US Government to purchase the social media giant for $10 billion.

via Now8News:

There is no doubt that Facebook has been a runaway success – but for who? It has been long suspected that Facebook has been feeding information to the NSA, CIA and other government entities and that they excessively use this site to monitor the online activity of Facebook users. The US government has already been caught taking dodgy steps with individual privacy.

There’s no denying the information gained by Facebook from its users is valuable to a degree and there is no question that the US government has been caught gathering private information without people’s consent. Does this mean the government now has an even larger agenda ahead of them? The government has made increasingly frequent demands for information from ISPs (Internet service providers), telecom companies, and other social media sites.

But the information generated by Facebook users has been the government’s primary resource on the American people. Insiders with confidential knowledge say that Zuckerberg is tired of the increasing demands from government entities. Finally, it has pushed him over the edge to sell. However, $10 billion is not a bad payday! But will you keep your Facebook account? Are you concerned about the privacy issues?

BELMOPAN, Belize –

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been kidnapped by Belize terrorists while vacationing with his family in the capital city of Belmopan. Police in Belize have received a single correspondence from the kidnappers, demanding $2 billion dollars in cash for his safe return.

Zuckerberg, who has a net worth of $70 billion, was visiting Belmopan with his family for a month-long vacation, and was reportedly taken by several men in masks who threw him into a van. His wife, who was with him at the time, was unharmed, and phoned police.

At this time, police are uncertain if Zuckerberg is alive, but remain hopeful that the kidnappers plan to abide by their word, and release him upon payment. Zuckerberg’s wife, Priscilla Chan, has said that they will pay the ransom immediately, as “$2 billion is really nothing when you have $68 billion more to play with.”

She says that once he is safely returned, they will continue their vacation.

SAN DIEGO, California –

Famed falled comedian Bill Cosby was rushed to a San Diego hospital after he was found violently beaten outside of his home. Police say that a neighbor called 911 after they saw Cosby laying in a pool of blood by his mailbox. A woman, whose name has not yet been released, has been arrested in conjunction with the assault.

According to police, the woman claims that Cosby raped her nearly 35 years ago, and that she felt it was “her time.”

Cosby has been accused by dozens of women of sexual misconduct over his long career, including several who say he drugged them and assaulted them while they were unconscious. Cosby, who was once the most loved man on television, has found himself the butt of jokes by other comedians who once idolized him.

Doctors say that Cosby is in stable, but critical condition. He was taken in with multiple broken ribs, a crack vertebrae in his neck, two broken wrists, as well as multiple contusions and cuts across his whole body. He was stabbed in the chest 3 times with what police say was a “very small” pocketknife.

SACRAMENTO, California –

Coffee drinkers, beware. A judge in California has just ruled that all coffees need to come with a label letting consumers know that the drink could cause cancer, as research has shown the roasting process of some beans may lead to cancerous cells. This includes labeling signs and cups in restaurants, including major chains like Starbucks.

Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle wrote in a proposed ruling Wednesday that Starbucks and other coffee companies failed to show that the threat from the chemical was insignificant.

“Frankly, we don’t give a shit if coffee causes cancer or not, it’s still delicious, right?” said Starbucks spokesperson Bill Richardson. “I have been drinking a dozen cups of Starbucks coffee every day for the last 18 years I’ve been with the company, and I’m still kicking. In fact, I’m kicking faster and with more focus. Damn, coffee is good.”

According to Starbucks, they will eventually comply with the law, letting consumers know that the coffee may be cancerous, but that it will take awhile before they can order new signs and cups.

“It’s not a quick process at all, for sure,” said Richardson. “We also plan to appeal, because I mean, come on. No one actually drinks our coffee anyway. It’s a status thing. You just carry around the cup so people can know that you’re a pretentious coffee drinker, but they’re not actually ingesting it. Our stores throw away more coffee than you can imagine. Come for the asshole servers, burnt espresso, and the free wi-fi – we’re not going to give you cancer. And if you do get cancer, are you ever going to trace it back to the coffee we served you? No. Get over it, whiners.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

Americans who are under the financial strain of repaying student loan debt may now be off the hook for their education costs. President Trump signed a new bill this week releasing any student who has accrued outstanding debt caused by college loans.

“Although certain costs of school are generally offset by private loans, grants, and scholarships, almost every student currently in a 2 or 4-year program has some existing loans with the US government,” said President Trump. “With this new bill, anyone who has taken loans from the federal government, at any point, will no longer be required to pay back those loans.”

Although the bill was signed on Friday afternoon, the program will not begin until the end of 2018, at which point current and former students will begin to see interest and repayment amounts on their loans delete automatically.

“Education is the single most important thing in my mind when it comes to furthering this great nation,” said Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. “I can think of no better way to help the young people, this next generation of thinkers and doers, than by helping them to stand on their feet more firmly, and not just worry about a future of paying back debt.”

With close to $1 billion in net income every year, private lender Sallie Mae has stated that they are not interested in following suit with the governments plan for loan forgiveness.

“We are a private company, and private lenders. We have no interest in forgiving anything. These little fuckers took out the loans, they can pay them back – with interest,” said Carla Edwarton, CEO of Sallie Mae. “Sure, yeah, education is important to us. You know what else is important? Learning about paying back your debts – with interest – or ruining your credit for life. Sorry you chose to pursue a degree in art history, little Johnny. Maybe you should have chosen a major that would make you some money.”

HORNWOOD, South Carolina –

A student at a high school in South Carolina has been arrested and expelled from school after it was discovered that he was not, as purported, a transgender student, but was in fact just trying to sneak into the girls’ showers so he can see them naked.

As reported by World News Daily Report:

Soccamee high school officials were alarmed by the student’s indecent behavior after several students and parents lodged complaints and reported the “immoral behavior” to school administrators. The transgender male student was recently allowed by school officials to use all female washrooms, including having access to the girl’s locker room, after he had asked to be treated as a biological female. The transgender male student also allegedly bragged about how the school would let him take showers with the girls just because he “wore a wig” and “painted his nails” according to several students.

The student, who has not been named, was arrested after it was stated that he inappropriately touched several of the girls while in the shower, and even was found masturbating while the girls were changing.

“He always had this huge erection while we were in the shower, I never understood why the school allowed a boy to be in the girls’ shower with us,” one female student told local reporters. “And I do mean huge. It kind of made me wish that he wasn’t a she, or…whatever. I just wanted him to ask for my number. I’ve gone black, but I’d definitely go back for that.”

The student was expelled from the school, and arrested on charges of lewd conduct and sexual battery.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump has gone back on his statements about arming teachers throughout the United States, claiming that he now considers it a “bad idea.”

“When I originally talked about arming the teachers of this country, with plans of having them trained and organized in order to better protect our children, it didn’t occur to me that we also have, well, you know…Blacks teaching our kids,” said Trump. “Obviously, we cannot arm more black people. They are half the reason we have gun violence in the first place.”

Trump also went on to state that no one had told him that there are, in some instances, teachers of a Mexican descent, as well as Muslim school teachers.

“The idea of arming these people, that’s something I cannot deal with,” said Trump. “There definitely is an answer we need to find for the protection of our students, of our schools, but arming minorities isn’t the way.”

FLORENCE, Italy –

Former President Barack Obama has announced his bid to become Italy’s newest Prime Minister. After discovering that Italian law did not dictate that the leader of the country must be a citizen, Obama stated that he had plans that would “directly lead to his election” as Italy’s Prime Minister.

“Italy has had 17 Prime Ministers in almost as many years, and it’s pathetic,” said Obama in a statement to the Italian people via ITV News. “In 8 years, I turned America from a depressed, Bush-era country into the thriving, amazing place it is today. If the Italian people go to the polls and write me in, I can do for your country what I did for mine.”

While there are several candidates currently running for the position, the Italian people are extremely divided on the ballots, and it’s likely that no leader will be chosen in the election. At that point, the existing sitting government can choose any person that the like, even if that person is not a citizen, and/or not a current member of government.

“I’d like to also tell the sitting government that I will work just as hard for the Italians as I did for the Americans,” said Obama. “There is no doubt in my mind that my leadership abilities will outshine anyone else you have running currently.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

Attorney General Jeff Sessions was arrested today after police in Washington, D.C. pulled him over for a broken tail light, and found over 20 pounds of marijuana in the car.

Police say that during the stop, the officer smelled a “strong odor” of marijuana coming from inside the vehicle, and asked to search through the car. When Sessions refused, a K9 unit was called to the scene.

“Despite marijuana being legal in D.C., it is still not legal to use it while driving, or driving while impaired,” said Officer Thomas Townsend, who was the arresting officer at the scene. “After we determined that Mr. Sessions was actually using, we decided to search the vehicle. It was at that point that we found the bricks in his trunk.”

Sessions was arrested and brought to a local D.C. police department for processing, but was immediately released at order of President Trump.

“Despite the interference by the current Presidential administration, we will still be moving forward with the charges against Mr. Sessions,” said Officer Townsend.

BOSTON, Massachusetts –

A 16-year-old in Boston has filed one of the most controversial lawsuits in modern history, with legal reports showing that he is suing his own biological parents for being born black.

Jamal Cutler, 16, claims he has suffered his whole life from the shame of being born black, especially because he goes to a predominantly white school outside of Boston, Massachusetts.\

“When I was a kid, I’d spend hours in the shower trying to wash off all the black from my skin, but it would never go away,” he recalls painfully.

His parents admit they were completely in shock when they learned their son had hired a lawyer against them. “We just want to end this nonsense, and we want him to come back home. We will love him no matter the color of his skin,” said Cutler’s mother, Maria, 48. “I’d love him even if he was the color of a baboon’s ass.” The young man’s lawyer, Robert Hoffman, claims his client has suffered severe psychological distress, symptoms of depression, and suicidal tendencies because of what he called “the burden of being a minority.” “My client did not choose to live this kind of life. Why would he have to carry the burden of hundreds of years of slavery and racism all because his parents had the selfish desire to bring a child into this world?” he sad during the suit’s opening statements before a judge and grand jury. “Because of the level of psychological distress of my client, we ask that his parents pay for all necessary expenses to change his racial status, including skin coloring treatments.” Cutler, who plans to change his name to John Smith after he converts to “white,” is asking that his parents pay for the $20,000 skin coloring treatment he needs. His lawyer argued in court that $20,000 is a low price to pay to positively change this young man’s life, considering the suicidal tendencies of his client and the “profound feeling of shame and despair” his client has faced since his birth.

PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania –

President Trump, who has been friends with WWE owner Vince McMahon for many years, and who has been a part of wrestling events in the past, will be appearing at tonight’s Royal Rumble in Philadelphia. Normally he’d be relegated to a sideline role, or a walk-in part where he may speak, but this event will be very different. Trump will actually be wrestling in the Rumble match.

“President Trump was asked to participate, and he said yes,” said White House spokesman Giles Anderson. “He and Vince McMahon are longtime friends, and he missed working with the WWE. It was President Trump’s suggestion that he actually participate in a physical role.”

Trump has secretly been training in the ring for the last 6 months in anticipation of tonight’s event, and is saying that he is confident in his abilities.

“I obviously will not be winning the match, I don’t think anyone expects that,” said President Trump. “But I will be able to hold my own with no problem.”

PALM BEACH, Florida –

President Trump has spent most of his winter vacation golfing with friends and family at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, but on his latest outing, the President was caught with his pants up…when perhaps they should have been down.

According to photographers at the golf game, President Trump was on the 13th hole and right after teeing off, he let out “a massive, wet, drippy fart sound.”

“It was simultaneously hilarious and disgusting,” said Chris Robbins, the photographer who captured the immediate aftermath. “I wasn’t getting any really good shots throughout the day, but then I heard Trump rip one, really hard and really wet. I look over, and he has literally shit himself. It was made even more hilarious because, like most dipshit golfers, he was wearing stupid clothes – white pants!”

Robbins was able to get a great shot of the President being scurried away by a member of his staff and his caddy, with brown streaks running down the back of his pants.

“I honestly think this picture might win me a Pulitzer,” said Robbins. “It’s far and away the best thing I’ve ever taken. So many of the other guys bought me beers in the Mar-A-Lago club lounge after this photo was published, I could barely stand up. Hell, I almost shit myself.”

The President had no comment on the incident, and maintained that “it never happened.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

Now that President Trump has successfully won the War on Christmas, he is setting his sights on another age-old advisory: The War on New Year’s Eve.

“It’s despicable that there are so many people wishing each other a ‘Happy New Year,’ when they have no idea if I believe that next year is going to be better than this one,” said President Trump. “Liberals like to push their agenda, they want you to have a happy 2018. Well that’s not right, that’s not going to work for everyone. 2017 was a big year. The biggest year. I’m not saying 2018 can’t be a big year, but we can’t just go out assuming it’s going to be great, it’s going to be happy.”

Trump said that he has begun wishing people a “decent New Year” or an “Okay New Year,” and on at least one occasion, a “shitty New year.”

“I have no reason to wish that specific person a Happy New Year, and I don’t particularly want them to have a Happy 2018,” said Trump, not mentioning the person by name. “Frankly, though, this entire happy nonsense has got to stop. I’m officially declaring it dead, and killing this war on New Year’s.

In an unplanned and quietly announced session at the White House on Friday, President Trump signed a bill reversing the gay marriage laws, and revoking the right for homosexuals to get married. The bill was signed only a short 20 minutes after Trump’s tax plan was made official.

“As a Christian, and as someone who wants America to be great again – as great as possible – I cannot, in good conscience, allow for gays to get married in this country,” said President Trump. “They will have to settle for just being boyfriends or girlfriends. That’s really all they need, anyway.”

The decision to reverse the law, which of course was created under Obama, comes as no surprise to Trump supporters, even the gay ones.

“I voted for him so, I mean, I guess that’s what I’m going to get, you know?” Said Marcus Crumb, a gay man in New York City. “I don’t know why I even marked his name off on the sheet. I could have chosen Jill Stein, you know? But she just has like, no style at all, and Trump wears just the most fabulous suits. I’ll take looking at Trump over getting married any day. No one says I can’t still like pumping a guy in the ass, right? I don’t need a piece of paper just ’cause I’m in love.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump has made a big deal about not showing his taxes, trying desperately to hide his actual income and net worth from the public. The reason why, many have speculated, is that he not only has cheated on his taxes, but that the forms would reveal how little he actually has in income. As it turns out, that is partially correct.

Although Trump has made a fortune selling his name and branding buildings, it was also recently discovered that the world’s most powerful leader is completely and totally flat broke.

“The President has a rather extreme, but somewhat relatable addiction to buying and collecting movies,” said a source from inside the White House. “I know that seems kind of bizarre, but Trump is like a big man-child, and his love of movies is vast. He has dedicated an entire wing of the White House to his DVD and Blu-ray collection. He has approximately 89,000 movies. It’s a full time job for a team of 3 people to organize and alphabetize his collection.”

According to the source, Trump spends nearly $30 million a year on his movie collection, and lately that number has increased, as he spends more and more on high-priced, out of print collectible copies, and on newer and more expensive titles, such as those that are being released in 4K high definition. For someone who was reportedly worth billions only a decade ago, the collection has slowly killed his net worth.

“The President has a problem, and it’s coming to a point where someone needs to have an intervention with him, but no one knows how,” said the source. “He’s out of control. On Black Friday, where sales are at their best, he went out and bought almost 100 new movies in one day. Then, just because that kick-started the buying bug, he ordered another 270 movies on Cyber Monday. The guy has a problem, and it’s killing us all.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

After lavish Christmas decorations and beautiful, “snow” covered trees were unveiled in the White House, many reporters and photographers were taken aback, and caught up in a Christmas spirit that many say was missing from the White House over the last several years.

But one reporter, who happens to be Jewish, wasn’t as impressed. Silas Jones, 30, of the New York Beat Entertainment magazine was reporting on the White House Christmas unveiling, and asked President Trump if they planned to add a menorah to the White House decorations in a couple of weeks when Chanukah starts.

“Fuck the Jews, no way am I putting up a menorah,” said Trump. “Everyone knows that the Jews are a dirty, disgusting people. And plus, they killed Jesus, and I can’t even stomach the idea of putting Jewey things next to these beautiful Christmas trees that my wife spent hours working to get up. No, there won’t be any Jew stuff here in the White House.”

Although this is the kind of comment that would normally bring outrage from the Left and from civil liberties groups such as the ACLU, Trump’s comments like this come so often that no one was even that offended.

“Totally expected,” said Jones. “I honestly only asked to get a rise, and he gave exactly what I wanted. He’s such an assclown.”

DETROIT, Michigan –

A new survey released today from the prestigious Harvard College of Detroit shows that residents across the state rated Flint tap water higher on the ‘Trustworthiness’ scale than current President Donald Trump. In the study, they found that Trump only was able to score a 14%, while Flint tap water scored a surprising 49%.

“Well, what do you expect?” said Michigan resident Duke Henry. “Thanks to the tap water in Flint, we’re really, really good at smelling shit. We know when something isn’t right. I can’t see through the tap water here, but I can see right through that Cheeto, and all of his lies.”

Resident Shirley Tanner agrees. “At some point you have to stop blaming the water for the fact your kids are dumb and lazy,” she said. “I would trust a fart after a Taco Bell run more than I’d ever trust President Trump.”

Other findings from the study were also critical of Trump’s trustworthiness. “Donald Trump’s lies affect brain development, in both children and adults, but especially those active on the internet,” said Dr. Miles Teller, who conducted the study. “Exposure to Trump’s falsehoods can also cause, among other things, full-blown retardation in those exposed for long periods of time. The neurological and behavioral effects of his lies are believed to be irreversible.”

There’s widespread and growing lack of confidence in the safety of vaccines. If you know anyone who still believes that vaccines can’t cause autism, you might want to show them this article. Take a look at the DTaP vaccine insert:

These reports come directly from the FDA website, where they have had it posted for several years, although it was “buried” under a lot of links and other research that obscured the actual research.

“This has been a problem for many, many years, and I’m glad it’s finally coming to light,” said Dr. Mario Garcia, who was one of the first to find the correlation between vaccines and autism. “I was shut out for years from being able to talk about this, but now that others are finding out, I am very grateful. Please, do not vaccinate your children.”

President Trump has reportedly been rushed to the emergency room after becoming extremely ill and vomiting after eating a piece of Halloween candy. White House officials and police are remaining tight-lipped, but an anonymous staffer has confirmed that authorities believe the candy was poisoned.

“Trump decided that he wanted to dress up and trick-or-treat through the White House, and so every person on staff was required to stand in a doorway with a bowl of candy, and wait for President Trump to come and collect some,” said the staffer. “We do not know from which person or room the tainted candy may have come, but police are investigating.”

At this time, there is no further word on the President’s condition. This is the first known case of a poisoning perpetrated on Halloween of a President.

BOISE, Idaho –

Marissa and Alex Murphy of Idaho say they have been Donald Trump supporters “since the beginning,” and are adamant that he will help to Make America Great Again. They are such strong fans that they named their newborn son in his honor: Donald Trump Murphy. But the naming has apparently caused them a great deal of issues, as President Trump has reportedly filed a lawsuit against the couple.

“Donald Trump is suing us for breach of copyright and trademark,” said Marissa, 30. “We named our son Donald because we love President Trump. This was supposed to be something beautiful, but we are so distressed. It would cost us a lot to have his name changed at this point, but President Trump is suing us anyway, saying that no one else can be named Donald Trump. He apparently has a copyright on his own name.”

President Trump could not be reached for comment, but a spokesman from the White House did admit there was a lawsuit pending. The amount is undisclosed, but the Murphys say it is for $3 million.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump pardoned himself this morning for what he says are years of “alleged” sexual assault accusations, as well as rumblings of abuse. Despite the President not being formally charged with any crimes, many women have accused him of sexual misconduct over the years, all of which he has denied.

“In the wake of my good friend, Mister Harvey Weinstein, being viciously attacked by the media over abuse charges, I felt it was time to act in advance of any legal or civil charges being lobbied my way,” said President Trump. “Although I adamantly deny that I have ever been sexually inappropriate with any woman, especially the ugly ones who always accuse me of doing so, I have fully pardoned myself of any and all crimes and charges.”

While it was pointed out to the president that he could neither pardon himself, nor could he pre-pardon someone for crimes they have not been charged with, Trump remained steadfast in his decision that he had been fully pardoned.

As of January 1, 2018, if you are caught speeding, the amount of your fine will depend on the model of your vehicle, lawmakers say. The change will be used to help pay for more police, and more road repairs in nearly every state in the country.

“The more expensive the vehicle, the more expensive the fine will be,” said George Marks, R-Georgia, who sponsored the bill, which was passed by the House on September 21st. “If you can afford a $90,000 Tesla sports car, then your ticket is going to be a lot higher than the tool driving the beat up Mazda.”

For photographs taken by radar, an auto expert will determine the model of the car, motorcycle, or truck. The cheapest vehicles will be fined lightly, whereas high-end vehicles will face much heavier fines.

This measure acknowledges the inequality between those “who can afford” to pay the fines and those who “suffer” under the repressive system. Thus, the wallets of the most well-to-do will be hit just as hard as those of the most humble.

The measure promises to reduce delinquency on the road by the wealthy, thus eliminating the feeling of impunity shared among more and more drivers.

Donald Trump doesn’t believe babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrant parents are American citizens.

“I don’t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers — and I know some will disagree, but many of them agree with me — and you’re going to find they do not have American citizenship,” Trump said Tuesday in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. “We have to start a process where we take back our country. Our country is going to hell.”

Trump claims that those born on U.S. soil to illegal immigrants don’t have full citizens’ rights. “What happens is they’re in Mexico, they’re going to have a baby, they move over here for a couple of days, they have the baby,” he told O’Reilly. Trump asserted, “Many lawyers are saying that’s not the way it is in terms of this,” and went on to say, “They are saying it is not going to hold up in court. It will have to be tested but they say it will not hold up in court.”

The GOP presidential hopeful does not, however, support amending the Constitution to repeal birthright citizenship, saying it would be a “long process.”

“I think it would take too long,” he told Fox News. “I’d much rather find out whether or not anchor babies are citizens because a lot of people don’t think they are. We’re going to test it out.”

Trump will begin the process to locate and deport illegal “Anchor Babies” as early as next week. Any immigrant who has illegally overstayed a visa or entered the country illegally, along with any children of illegal immigrants, no matter what age or how long they have resided in the United States, will be deported beginning as early as mid-February.

President Trump recently admitted to “hitting the bong” in a brave tweet, in which he called for legalization of marijuana at the federal level. The President said that he was wrong, and it seems things may be changing. Trump tweeted earlier today:

“Now that I have actually tried hitting the bong, I realize I was wrong. Marijuana should DEFINITELY be legal at the federal level. So dank.”

There was no further word on whether President Trump planned to make changes to the laws banning marijuana, but pot smokers everywhere are rejoicing.

“Oh man, that’s dope as hell,” said stoner Derek Paul after reading the tweet from the President. “I hated this dude, but if he’s gonna be hit the bowl, too, and gonna make the shit legal, then I respect the hell out of him. That’s awesome.”

Trump did not mention the tweet in a press conference that was held only hours later, although several times he was asked to elaborate on “hitting the bong” by journalists.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had some choice words for US President Donald Trump Friday, accusing the American leader of “mentally deranged behavior.” He went on to say, “He is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician,” Mr. Kim said.

Mr. Trump on Friday responded with some name-calling of his own. On Twitter, the president called Mr. Kim “obviously a madman.”

Trump has repeatedly said that, “the time for talk is over,” and has proposed what is being called a radical diplomatic solution. Epic rap battle. As both leaders enjoy talking smack, and nuclear war would obliterate the human race, this is being hailed as the perfect solution.

Initially Kim Jong Un proposed a wrestling match, but Trump backed down after hearing the rumor Kim Jong Un is a champion ssireum wrestler. Ssireum is a folk wrestling style and traditional national sport of Korea. While it is likely this is yet another one of Kim Jong Un’s unsubstantiated claims about his physical prowess, advisors warned Trump that at 71, nearly twice the age of North Korea’s leader, this was potentially a game he would not win.

Although North Korea’s leader taunted Trump for backing down from the wrestling match, calling him a “frightened dog,” he accepted Trump’s suggestion to rap battle, saying he would “annihilate the senile, dotard, American snake bastard.”

Critics worry Trump’s repertoire of racist slurs and “yo momma” jokes will not be enough to win the rap battle, but Trump is confident his old white guy swagger will prevail. “Rocketman ain’t got nothin’ on me,” he said in a recent tweet. Still, by coming up with an epic dis like Dotard, Kim Jong Un has demonstrated his masterful use of antiquated language and shown he knows his way around a thesaurus. Trump’s straightforward style may cost him points in the creativity category, as so far the best insults he has delivered include nicknames such as, Crooked Hillary, Lyin’ Ted, Crazy Bernie, and Low Energy-Jeb. “Cryin’ Chuck” and “Rocketman” do show he is capable of alliteration and ripping off Elton John songs though, so he may be able to pull it off.

A date for the competition has yet to be set, but ample time will be given to allow each leader to prepare dope rhymes . The rap battle will be judged by a panel of hip hop artists including Ice Cube, Big Baby Ghandy, Kang Chun-hyok, and Yang Dong-geun.

President Trump has apparently undergone cosmetic surgery to remove what is affectionately known as his “pussy neck,” because the flappy, old man folds under his chin form into an uncanny resemblance of a woman’s vagina.

“The President is actually extremely self-conscious, as you can well imagine, and he has seen the jokes, the memes, and he doesn’t like them,” said a White House representative. “President Trump has scheduled a surgery to remove the extra skin around his neck, and get an overall face lift.”

President Trump said that he is “very excited” to have the procedure completed, and that it wouldn’t cost the taxpayers “very much at all.”

“I, for one, think that he should keep his floppy twat neck skin,” said Vice President Mike Pence. “Every time I look at him right now, I’m always ‘Thinkin’ Arby’s.’ I don’t really want that to change, but I guess what’s good for him is good for us all.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump announced late last night that congress voted 322 to 105 in favor of dismantling the statue of liberty, due to its “misleading statements” engraved on the pedestal.

The statue reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” According to Americans Against Illegal Immigration, along with our Republican Congress and Donald Trump, this statement misleads immigrants from other countries. It may have them believing they are welcome into America at any time.

“We do not want to allow the tired, poor and homeless into this country. We have enough of those already,” said President Trump. “If they’re tired, poor, and homeless in their own country, what makes you think they’ll do any better over here?Guarantee you they will go on welfare and rob people to survive. That’s what they do. I cannot Make America Great Again if we’re always feeding the hungry from other countries.”

The dismantling of the Statue of Liberty is set to begin March 1, 2018. It is estimated it will take two months to dismantle, then released for shipment back to France by the end of next year. The Statue of Liberty has been seated on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor since October 28, 1886.

The New York historical Museum has already vowed to occupy the area around the historic site for a “sit in” type protest where they will handcuff one another to form a complete circle around the base of the statue.

“They cannot tear it down if we form an unbreakable human barrier,” said José Ramirez, president of the Immigrant Resource Center of New York. “As Patrick Henry said, ‘Give me liberty, or give me death!’ We are not backing down.”

In a move that nearly everyone called “totally retarded,” President Trump stood out on the White House balcony during the solar eclipse, and stared directly into the sun. White House physician, Dr. Mark Campbell, now reports that Donald Trump has lost nearly 50% of his vision in one eye.

“President Trump was warned that staring at the sun could cause serious damage, but he assumed it was fake news,” said Dr. Campbell. “Since the eclipse, Trump’s vision has become worse and worse, with a noticeable deterioration of his retina. There is no reversing it.”

Dr. Campbell went on to say that Trump’s left eye experienced some damage as well, but that the right eye sustained the brunt of the damage.

President Trump welcomed a dozen members of the notorious white-power group, the Ku Klux Klan, to the White House on Sunday night.

The group reportedly were invited so that President Trump could “discuss the future” with them. They were also all treated to a tour of the White House, a gourmet dinner, and a cross burning in the back lawn area of the White House.

“You know, this house was built using slave labor, which to me, is the best kind of labor, because it’s free,” said Trump to the laughing klansman.

According to reports, the group partied late into the evening, and Trump had a private escort drive the Klan members to a private airfield at around 4 a.m. Monday morning.

When asked what the “future” might hold for the KKK, Trump simply said that he was trying to offer a friendly hand to open discussions.

Senator John McCain shocked the entire country by voting NO on the Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor the other day, but even though he made a wave of new fans from the left, he is now saying he made a mistake, and that his brain tumor is to brain.

“I momentarily lost my senses, and literally couldn’t remember which way was up, and which was down,” said McCain, speaking from his home, where doctors have put him on bedrest. “I meant, of course, to vote TO repeal it, as was the plan. As I’ve mentioned before. There’s nothing that Republicans like doing more than screwing the entire country, and so naturally I should have given a thumbs-up. I swear I did. This brain tumor is really taking its toll.”

Unfortunately, the vote sticks as-is, unless a majority calls for a new vote sometime in the next 90 days.

“I think at that vote, I may abstain,” said McCain. “If I’m still alive, I really don’t want to mess this up again, and you never know how my vote might go.”

In a major move by a sitting president, Donald Trump has “pre-pardoned” himself before he commits any crimes while in office.

“There is a good chance, if I continue on the track I’m going, that there are going to be a lot of different crimes happening, and a few of them will be pretty serious,” said Trump in a statement to the press. “So I’ve taken measures to protect myself and my cabinet from prosecution should the crimes happen.”

A sitting president has, for the most part, the legal ability to pardon nearly any criminal they wish, but it is used very sparingly. This is the first time a president has ever pardoned themselves. The ACLU has a team of lawyers confirming the legality of Trump’s pardon.

“We really don’t think this is legal at all,” said ACLU president Carl Grover. “We are looking into it. It’s such a stupid thing, no one has ever done it before, we’re not even sure how well it can hold up. But knowing Trump, he’s probably changed or removed enough other laws to somehow make this legal. He’s clearly the king of the loophole.”

Michelle Obama has just revealed a shocking secret – one that the far-right has been hounding her about for years, but in fact, turns out to be true. Michelle Obama is transgender, and was actually born as a male.

“I was born Michael LaVaughn Robinson, and changed my name to Michelle when I was only 12-years-old,” said Obama. “I knew that it didn’t feel right. I wasn’t a boy. I never cared about doing boy things. I just wanted to be a princess, I wanted to ride ponies. When I was a teen, I realized I also liked boys. It was really a confusing, difficult time, but my parents were very supportive.”

Obama says she underwent surgery in her late 20s to begin converting to a woman, and the entire process was completed when she was in her early 30s, right before she met Barack.

“He has known from the beginning, of course,” said Obama. “I never shied away from my past, and there was no way I was going to get into a relationship with someone starting with a lie. So yes, he’s always been aware that I used to be a man.”

Michelle said that their children were not adopted, but they obviously used a surrogate, with Barack providing the sperm.

“They are biologically his children, for sure,” said Obama. “I am not going to disclose who the mother is, because it doesn’t matter. I am their mother. They know everything, and they don’t care. They see me as their mom, and always will, because that’s who I am – I’m mom.”

,"NEW YORK – Daniel Hernandez, known by his stage name ‘Tekashi 6ix9ine’, testified against his former gang the “Nine Trey Bloods”. Daniel reportedly testified against numerous fellow gang members including rappers Jim Jones and Cardi B. However, it is also being reported that Daniel allegedly testified against the infamous Zodiac Killer to reduce his sentence even further than planned. Daniel identified the zodiac killer him as “Lawrence Gill” of Vallejo, California.

“The Zodiac Killer” is the name given to an unidentified serial killer who was active during the 1960s and 1970s in Northern California, allegedly committing murders in numerous cities including San Francisco, Vallejo, Benicia, and Lake Berryessa. The Zodiac Killer has remained one of the biggest criminal mysterious in modern history with the killer never caught or identified. According to authorities, Daniel identified The Zodiac Killer by name, as well as the city in which he hailed from.

According to authorities, Daniel’s claims to the Zodiac Killers identity don’t give much hope, as they say it is unlikely that Daniel would have any knowledge on the killers identity, but that it was worth keeping in mind, considering how compliant Daniel has been with authorities since being arrested. “I need to get out here asap” Daniel to the judge, “i’m not STOOPID” he then shouted. “It’s nice to have a snitch”, said the judge overseeing the case, “It’s not that common”.

Although unlikely, if Daniel’s claim to the zodiac killers identity is true, Daniel can have all charges dropped and even rewarded in free tattoos and marijuana, as well as citizenship for his parents for helping solve such a high profile case.

Hitcherfield who now lives with his boyfriend, says he never experienced any homosexual thoughts until he started vaping.

,"Why do men cheat? And why do they sometimes continue cheating after they’re caught, even in the face of profoundly unwanted consequences like divorce, loss of parental contact, loss of social standing?

A new study by Dr. Lethat Mango suggests a man who cheats and on his girlfriend or wife are more loyal and faithful than men who don’t cheat. Many dynamics can play into a man’s decision to engage in infidelity. In his study he found that men who cheat have so much love they can’t control themselves, and sometimes this leads to cheating, but he cheats because he can’t control his overwhelming love.

He also found that most men don’t cheat intentionally sometimes it is accidental forgiving your man for accidentally cheating can help you build a better relationship with your partner.

Dr. Lethat Mango also found in his study that men aren’t driven to cheat by lust or temptation but are pushed by their spouse to cheat. This means that sometimes the problem isn’t the man but the woman.

The conclusion of this study is that men who cheat are the men you need around you if your husband or boyfriend is too honest he’s hiding something from you a man who cheats is open, and you know his faults and could help him grow as a person.

After Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road became an internet sensation thanks to apps like Twitter and Tik Tok, it has since become number 1 on Apple Music, number 1 on Spotify, and currently peaking at number 15 on the Billbord hot 100. After its debate of being rap or country, Billboard decided to take the song off the country charts, sparking backlash against billboard with many claiming it was because of Lil Nas X’s race. However, Billy Ray Cyrus’ feature on the remix is apparently enough for it to be country. “We’re adding it back” said Billboard spokesperson Jerry Faulkner, “we’re only adding back Old Town Road because Billy Ray Cyrus is one of my favorite singers, otherwise we would still have said no because he doesn’t look like a country person to me.”

Although not admitting it being because Lil Nas X is black, it seems as though it is the actual reason. “My damn daughter keeps playing that song at home i’m tired of it, I always tell her to shut that black music up”, said Faulkner.

NEW ORLEANS, LA –It was an explosive matchup between the Saints and Rams this Sunday. But perhaps the most exciting moment came between the whistles, when a voluptuous and positively beautiful woman stormed the field in nothing but her birthday suit. In the opinion of this reporter, this woman was an absolute fox. I mean.. Goddamn.



While the woman pranced around the field in slow-motion Baywatch fashion, NFL security inexplicably could not catch her for a full 45 minutes. The team tried corralling her from all angles as some security members preferred chasing from behind and others preferred the front. A few guards were seen filming the chase on their phones, a practice that the league later defended as “standard protocol.”



The woman was eventually pinned down by Rams cornerback Marcus Peters, who proceeded to spread rose petals around her, light a scented candle, and play Sisqó music from a portable speaker. Peters noted that he always has a go-bag ready for such occasions.



The crowd did not seem to mind the delay, as the 75,000 fans in attendance were on their feet and cheering on the beautiful woman. However, most male fans remained seated for the remainder of the game once the chase ended.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","BECKLEY, W.V. – The nation’s largest mining union issued a rare public apology on Friday after shocking images surfaced this week depicting a group of predominantly white mine workers emerging from a rural West Virginia coal mine wearing blackface.

“This is not who we are,” United Mine Workers of America president Cecil Robertson said in a statement posted to the organization’s website. “The rogue actions of a handful of disgruntled individuals do not reflect the values of the United Mine Workers of America or its members,” Robertson said, adding that beginning January 1, 2020, all UMWA members will be required to undergo a mandatory six-month racial-bias and sensitivity training seminar.

Maya Davis, a prominent blogger and self-described ‘social justice warrior,’ blasted Robertson’s statement, calling it “half-hearted at best.” The twenty-nine-year-old former dog walker told MSNBC that such incidents are not isolated. “Sure, those of us who are less woke tend to look at this and think, okay, these miners are all backwoods bumpkin types hopped up on methamphetamine or whatever crazy sh*t they’ve cooked up in their bathtubs, but the reality is actions have consequences and people need to be held accountable.”

Azariah Landry, co-founder of the American Anti-Blackface Coalition, or Double A-BC, said their organization recently launched a petition calling on the United Mine Workers of America to hire diversity officers tasked with monitoring mining operations throughout the country. “We’re also pushing for the installation of chemical showers at every mine exit to prevent any further incidents,” they said.

For her part, Maya Davis says change must be immediate and radical. “As a privileged white person, I find it absolutely appalling that right this very minute, all across America, thousands –possibly tens of thousands– of miners are punching out and walking off the job site in blackface and no one bats an eye,” the veteran social justice warrior told Real News Right Now, adding, “I am sick to my stomach thinking about it.

“Congress has made clear that if a political candidate or party strongly believes that soliciting foreign interference in an election is in the best interest of the country, then doing so is both constitutionally and legally acceptable,” DNC chairman Tom Perez announced during a press briefing at the party’s headquarters in Washington, later adding, “We finally have a level playing field.”

Under the terms of the agreement, French and German intelligence agencies will launch a joint operation designed to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of the Democratic presidential nominee. In exchange, the DNC has provided a guarantee that the incoming administration will significantly increase funding and support for NATO. “Think of it as a kind of quid pro quo”, explained Mr. Perez who later added that France and Germany will have the unique opportunity to “heavily” influence U.S. foreign policy in Europe and the Balkans.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump may have inadvertently committed three felonies in the hours leading up to his noontime intelligence briefing on Thursday, a senior administration official with firsthand knowledge of the events told the Associated Press.

The excitement began around 5:45 a.m. Thursday morning as Secret Service agents responded to a smoke alarm in the Executive Residence. There, agents encountered the president and first lady standing in silence in the Family Kitchen with the charred remains of what appeared to be a pile of U.S. currency smoldering on a nearby table. President Trump later told aides he had set fire to a garbage bag stuffed with hundred dollar bills “to make a point.”

At approximately 7:30 a.m. that same morning, the White House was placed on lockdown after Duke, a three-year veteran of the Secret Service K-9 Division, was found dead in the Rose Garden. The lockdown was lifted less than fifteen minutes later after President Trump told a member of the White House communications team that the bomb-sniffing dog had begun foaming at the mouth while he was feeding it spoonfuls of chocolate syrup during a Fox & Friends commercial break.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an email sent to constituents on Saturday, Republican congressman Jim Jordan who represents Ohio’s 4th District announced he is set to unveil new legislation this week aimed at eliminating the federal witness protection program.

Established in the 1970s and implemented by the Department of Justice, the Witness Security Program –or WITSEC– was designed to protect federal and state witnesses in cases involving organized crime and other serious offenses from threats or intimidation. Congressman Mike Turner (R-Oh), who co-sponsored the legislation, said the “proliferation of heresy” and “a complete and total lack of witness credibility” call into question the program’s legitimacy.

The bill is part of a larger effort by House Republicans to repeal the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act, under which WITSEC was established. “These laws have no place in modern society,” Congressman Devin Nunes (R-Ca) told Fox News host Laura Ingram on Saturday. “This was the seventies,” Mr. Nunes explained, continuing, “You had no iPhones then; there was no Internet. It was a different era, Laura, and, frankly, these so-called ‘mafia tactics’ are nothing more than liberal talking points – meaning they don’t exist.”

Citing 18 US Code § 1512-13, which prohibits tampering or retaliating against a witness, victim, or informant, Congressman Nunes said lawmakers need to take a closer look at the terminology. “We need to reexamine the definition of those terms and, more specifically, how and under what conditions they’re applied,” the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee said.

Congressman Jim Jordan on Saturday said the specific portions of the Act which cover obstruction of court orders; obstruction of a federal audit; and obstructing examination of a financial institution have become “archaic” and obsolete. “Take the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, for example,” Jordan told WJW Cleveland, a local Fox affiliate, continuing, “It’s incomprehensible now, but at the time there was a legitimate need for it.”

“We are going to do it. Absolutely,” Senator McConnell told WHAS 840, a Kentucky news radio station. “I’ll have my secretary pencil something in as soon as we return to Washington.” Without providing a specific date, McConnell said the bipartisan talks would take place at a Starbucks coffee shop located a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. “This will be an informal discussion, but a real discussion nonetheless,” Mr. McConnell told the station.

Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fl.) have also agreed to take part in the upcoming talks on the gun violence epidemic, with Senator Graham serving as a “semi-official” mouthpiece for President Donald J. Trump, who does not drink coffee.

Florida senator Marco Rubio, who, in 2017, vowed never to set foot in a Starbucks again after the company “used holiday cups to launch a covert campaign propagating the gay agenda,” told Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson that he intends to bring a gun to Starbucks “for my own personal safety.” When pressed, Mr. Rubio declined to speculate on the duration of the conversation but said it would “likely depend on how long a line there is.”

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony before Congress this week, President Donald J. Trump on Friday issued a controversial executive order abolishing America’s longstanding two-party system and criminalizing the formation of political organizations not sanctioned by the White House.

“Despite the failed efforts of Nancy Pelosi and the radical left, my administration has accomplished more in the last two years than any administration in the history of this country and very possibly the world,” President Trump boasted as he signed the historic order into law. “The time has come to unite our great nation under the banner of a single party: the America First Party,” the president announced, later calling it “frankly, the only legitimate political party” in the United States.

Aptly named The Law Against the Formation of New Parties, the presidential directive prohibits the creation of “opposition parties,” and bars anyone not affiliated with the newly established America First Party from holding public office. “Elected officials are required by law to register with the Party if they wish to serve out the remainder of their term,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters, adding that President Trump has given Congress a “grace period” of five weeks to do so. “Following the August recess, proof of party membership is required for all persons who wish to enter the U.S. Capitol complex,” Grisham explained, adding that the new policy applies to all federal buildings.

While party membership is not mandatory for all Americans, those who fail to register will “voluntarily” give up certain civil liberties and freedoms such as the right to gun ownership, possession and consumption of alcohol, and interstate travel. “In extreme cases, state or local party leadership may grant a temporary waiver allowing for interstate travel,” White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Breitbart News. One of the key authors of The Law Against the Formation of New Parties, Miller said the policy was designed to “make it easier for law enforcement to round up illegals and restrict the movement of subversives.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security on Friday announced that federal agents executed dozens of early morning raids across the United States targeting the Democratic National Committee and other illegal political organizations.

Trump’s re-election campaign as part of a deal brokered by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a spokesperson for the Trump 2020 re-election campaign confirmed on Thursday.

According to the terms of the deal, intelligence assets operating out of the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C. will do “whatever necessary within the confines of Saudi law” to ensure a Trump victory in 2020. In exchange, the Trump administration will grant Saudi Arabia a twenty-five percent discount on arms sales through 2050 – a move that is sure to strengthen President Trump’s increasingly intimate relationship with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

While campaign officials declined to elaborate on the nature of Saudi support, an aide to White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was present during talks with Saudi officials, told Real News Right Now that agents from the General Investigation Directorate, or Mabahith, have already begun providing campaign officials with information on Mr. Trump’s opponents in the U.S. media.

“They’ve been instructed to neutralize any potential troublemakers before they can exercise their potential to spread disinformation about the president,” the aide explained, adding that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman fulfilled a personal request from President Trump to use the team tasked with silencing Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi in October of 2018. “This isn’t your run-of-the-mill opposition research team; we’re talking about an extremely capable group of individuals,” the aide said.

Tim Murtaugh, who serves as communications director for the Trump 2020 presidential campaign, told The Washington Times that campaign officials working in conjunction with Saudi embassy staff have established an “unofficial joint operations center” at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. A short walk from the White House, the luxurious 5-star hotel is considered a “safe haven” for administration officials, Trump supporters, and like-minded diplomats. The communications director said hotel security has gone “above and beyond the call of duty” to prevent audio and video surveillance. “It’s probably the only hotel in the world that is completely unbuggable,” Murtaugh noted.

In an ABC News interview airing this week, President Trump said he would not report election assistance from a foreign adversary to the FBI. “It’s called oppo research,” he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. He later clarified his statement, saying he would report it if the information provided turned out to be “incorrect.”",Saudi Arabia Agrees to Help President Trump Win Re-Election in 2020,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/06/saudi-arabia-agrees-to-help-president-trump-win-re-election-in-2020/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Attorney General William Barr has announced the appointment of a special prosecutor to oversee a Justice Department investigation into the authenticity of former president Barack Obama’s birth certificate. “This is something that President Trump and I both agree is long overdue,” Attorney General William Barr told reporters during a press briefing at the Department of Justice on Tuesday.

“The president has asked me to appoint a competent nonpartisan prosecutor to spearhead the investigation,” Attorney General Barr explained. Mr. Barr went on to say that due to “the desolate state” of the DOJ, he saw no other option but to appoint himself as special counsel for the birth certificate investigation. “I cannot, in good faith, trust anyone other than myself to lead an investigation of this magnitude,” the attorney general concluded.

While Mr. Barr declined to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, he said Justice Department lawyers are preparing subpoenas for a number of individuals believed to be associated with the birth of Barack Hussein Obama on August 4, 1961. “In the coming weeks we will issue subpoenas for those individuals charged with record keeping at the Honolulu hospital where Mr. Obama was allegedly born,” the attorney general stated, adding that the doctors who “allegedly delivered” the infant Obama -or their next of kin- will also be called to testify.

In an official statement released Wednesday, former CIA director and acting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Department of State is lending “limited support” to Mr. Barr’s investigation. “We at the State Department are working closely with our counterparts in the Kenyan government to locate a witch doctor who is suspected of masterminding the plot to conceal Barack Obama’s national origin,” the statement read.

“This is about seeking absolute confirmation that Barack Obama was actually eligible to hold office from 2008 until 2016,” a senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told The Washington Times. “In the end we’re looking at the immediate removal of all Obama-era appointees including federal judges and Supreme Court Justices; not to mention a full reversal of any Obama policies and pardons that President Trump may have missed or overlooked,” the official told The Times.

Although both the Obama White House and the state of Hawaii have produced copies of Mr. Obama’s long-form birth certificate, President Donald J. Trump believes both to be forgeries and has long called for an investigation into their legitimacy. “They’ve got an entire black market for fake birth certificates,” then-candidate Trump told Fox News host Chris Wallace in 2015, adding, “It’s a terrible thing what they’re doing on that island.”

The Department of Justice investigation into the validity of Barack Obama’s birth certificate -along with his status as an American citizen- is expected to last at least two and a half years and will cost U.S. taxpayers upwards of $250 million.",Barr Appoints Special Counsel to Determine Validity of Obama’s Birth Certificate,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/05/barr-appoints-special-counsel-to-determine-validity-of-obamas-birth-certificate/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,FALSE

Trump is said to be weighing military options in response to a nearly one million-strong human caravan currently making its way through southern Mexico en route to the U.S. border, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced on Wednesday. The massive caravan, which Sanders said “can be seen from space,” is believed to be mostly made up of migrants fleeing violence in Central and South America.

“In addition to those who may or may not be seeking asylum, there are reports of thousands of Islamic militants, Mexican drug smugglers, Eastern European arms dealers, Iranian intelligence agents, transgenders, and a handful of undocumented workers affiliated with the Special Counsel investigation who are known to vote and donate Democratic,” Press Secretary Sanders warned, adding that if congressional Democrats fail to provide funding for the border wall before the caravan reaches the U.S. border, “the blood will be on their hands.”

Citing unspecified intelligence reports, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told Real News Right Now that the one million-strong caravan is currently moving “northward at approximately five miles per hour” through Mexico’s Trans-Mexican Volcano Belt. “It’s certainly feasible that the mountains could slow them down or cause small groups to branch off,” Miller speculated before concluding, “Either way, we need to prepare for the worst.”

President Trump chimed in Wednesday afternoon in a tweet to the American people, saying, “We are facing [a] NATIONAL EMERGENCY on our southern border with no help from Nancy and the Democrats. The Wall must be built IMMEDIATELY.” Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) told senate Republicans to prepare for “the very real possibility” of another government shutdown. “The president and I are in agreement that it may be necessary to divert funding from certain domestic programs in order to defend the nation from this grave threat,” Mr. McConnell was quoted as saying.

“A wall might not even stop them at this point, we don’t know,” Mr. Trump told reporters following an intelligence briefing at the White House on Wednesday. “I’m told they’re leaving a trail of death and destruction the likes of which has never been seen before,” the president said moments before boarding Marine One. “We’ll have to see what happens but we might need some very big bombs -and believe me, we have them- but as I just told my defense secretary, whatever it takes.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump defended the late Joseph Stalin during a Saturday morning on-air phone call to Fox & Friends Weekend, saying the former Soviet dictator was right to erect a wall around Allied-controlled West Berlin following the collapse of Germany at the end of World War II.

“We should never have even been in Germany to begin with,” President Trump argued in a heated exchange with Fox & Friends co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy. “You had Teddy Roosevelt who of course was a democrat and terrible with money. He cost this country billions of dollars,” the president charged before adding, “We were the laughing-stock of the world.”

An unabashed supporter of Russian –and now Soviet– foreign policy, President Trump applauded Stalin’s role in the planning and construction of the Berlin Wall, saying the communist dictator was “the only one brave enough” to stand up to the United States. “Of course you had Adolf Hitler -and there are some who say he may have been a bad hombre- but quite frankly he was a very effective leader,” President Trump argued. “But, Rachel, I will tell you I have always disagreed with his practice of illegally crossing borders. I disagree with that and I should disagree with it.”

Mr. Trump then went on to attack former president Bill Clinton who he said was responsible for the fall of the Berlin Wall. “He went over there – and you remember because Hillary went on record during the debates claiming she came under sniper fire – but Bill and Hillary went to Germany -which they had no right to do- and demanded they tear down that wall. Ten or maybe twelve years later we have 9/11 and something like three thousand dead Americans. It’s a disgrace.”

President Trump has been working tirelessly around the clock -even skipping Christmas and New Years- to drum up support for a much-needed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The nearly 2,000-mile-long border separating the United States from its Mexican neighbor is currently guarded by a handful of Border Patrol agents who, with very little funding, have managed to fend off hordes of crazed illegal immigrants.

“This is long overdue, folks. Long overdue,” President Trump declared as he proudly draped the gold medal around his neck. “I will tell you – and I’ve said this many times – I inherited a mess,” he admitted, continuing, “And many people have told me this but I think I’ve really done a tremendous job – quite possibly the best job of any president in the history of this country.”

President Trump, who is in Bedminster for an eleven-day working vacation, took a much-needed break from the golf course to reflect on his “innumerable” accomplishments as Commander-in-Chief. “We’ve solved the Flint water crisis but they wont tell you that,” Trump told an elegant ballroom packed full of enthusiastic supporters, club members, and his immediate family. “The people of Flint – they’re drinking clean water and believe me folks, they’re loving it. They love that water.”

Following a three-minute standing ovation, President Trump went on to tout his progress on the U.S. economy, saying, “We’ve broken a lot of records in terms of jobs. African-American unemployment is the lowest its been since before the Civil War. And the Hispanics – the ones who are here legally – are working harder than anyone ever thought possible.” Trump also congratulated himself for “single-handedly” disarming the Korean peninsula. “We’re working very hard to get North Korea a seat at the UN Security Council,” the president said, adding, “This is something they’ve wanted for a very long time and quite frankly I think they deserve to be there.”

"['R.

“The White House has asked us to make this a top priority,” Pentagon spokesperson Colonel Rob Manning told The Examiner. Col. Manning said the Department of Defense is working closely with officials in at least nine states to ensure that the arduous task of transporting six nuclear armed Minuteman III ICBMs from an Air Force installation in North Dakota to Washington, D.C. is done in a safe and efficient manner. “From a logistical standpoint, this is something which has never been done before,” Manning admitted.

“There was some back-and-forth over the inherent dangers of equipping the missiles with live nuclear warheads – especially for the purpose of a parade,” a senior Pentagon official told Real News Right Now, continuing, “But in the end, he’s the President of the United States and this is what he wants.” The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said each of the six Minuteman III ICBMs will be equipped with three W62 thermonuclear warheads. “A single warhead has a yield of about 170 kilotons,” the official explained. “So, essentially we’re looking at enough ordnance in downtown D.C. to level the entire Eastern seaboard.”

The Minuteman ICBMs are being transported using the Air Force’s specialized Transporter Erector Loader (TEL) trucks and will begin their 1,642 mile journey from Minot Air Force Base to Joint Base Andrews located just outside of Washington, D.C. in a matter of days. “Upon arrival, the missiles will be loaded onto six custom-built tractor trailers designed specifically for the parade,” a senior U.S. official involved in the parade’s planning told NBC News. At the request of President Trump, four of the ICBMs have been stenciled with the letters M-A-G-A. “The remaining missiles will be draped in ‘Trump 2020’ banners superimposed over the American flag,” the official explained, adding that attendees can expect to see the ICBMs at the forefront of the parade.

President Trump, who has described himself as a “lifelong friend” of the U.S. military, first floated the idea of hosting a military parade in Washington, D.C. after attending France’s annual Bastille Day parade alongside French president Emmanuel Macron last year. “We’re going to have to try and top it,” Trump later told reporters, adding that he found it peculiar that France would even have a military parade “considering they were so willing to surrender to the Nazis” during World War II.",Trump's Military Parade to Include Elements of U.S. Strategic Nuclear Arsenal,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/08/president-trumps-military-parade-to-include-elements-of-u-s-strategic-nuclear-arsenal/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,FALSE
"['R.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, indicated that Congressman Nunes had issued a classified memo on Thursday which contained evidence that the truck driver had worked a garbage route that covered the Clinton Foundation’s headquarters in New York City before abruptly relocating to Crozet, Virginia, some years earlier. “There’s no telling how deep this goes,” the source told The Examiner, adding, “We may have only scratched the surface.”

Multiple high-ranking intelligence officials with firsthand knowledge of the memo have confirmed to Real News Right Now that the House Intelligence Committee plans to open an investigation into how and why the Clinton Foundation may have orchestrated Wednesday’s collision. “What we’re hearing is that this was an attempt by [the deep state] to ultimately prevent the Republican leadership from reaching its destination,” a senior intelligence official told Real News Right Now. At the time of the crash, GOP leaders were en route to a secure below-ground facility at West Virginia’s prestigious Greenbrier resort.

“True or not, these allegations simply reinforce what we already know about the Clinton Foundation’s desire to establish a one-world government,” argued Bryon Jefferies, a visiting fellow at the conservative-leaning Heartland Institute. While Jefferies admitted he is not “well-versed” in the inner-workings of the Clinton Foundation, the veteran political analyst pointed to the foundation’s alleged involvement in uranium trafficking as well as its plans to harness control of the world’s water supply. “These are all just pieces of a much bigger puzzle,” Jefferies explained, continuing, “The end result is a new world order.”

Congressman Devin Nunes, who made headlines this week for his explosive memo questioning the FBI’s handling of FISA requests and domestic surveillance of the Trump campaign, issued a statement condemning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s alleged role in the Amtrak collision, saying, “We will not be cowed or bullied by Crooked Hillary any longer.

Trump on Thursday said he may have no choice but to issue an executive order suspending the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election in order to give lawmakers and public health officials more time to assess the ongoing vaping crisis which has gripped the nation since early August.

“We have a tremendous problem in our country in terms of vaping. You have these people who are young and quite frankly very innocent and they want to be cool, they want to be captain of the football team, so they start vaping,” President Trump told reporters moments before boarding Air Force One. “And what’s happening is very many of them are dying as a result and nobody really knows why. So I’ve told my people, let’s forget about the election until we can figure out what the hell is going on.”

Coming on the heels of a recent study by the FDA which revealed that children under the age of eighteen find the taste of tobacco “physically repulsive,” President Trump in early September announced he was taking steps to implement a nationwide ban on the sale of non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes. “I said I think it’s a mental health problem but I’ve spoken to many doctors and they’ve told me it might be something else. Frankly, I think they have no idea what, but nobody does and it’s very scary,” the president said at the time.

We’re looking into Mexico; we’re looking into Hunter Biden’s relationship with the vaping industry; very possibly Adam Schiff might be involved – at this point we don’t know but I will tell you we have some of the best people looking into it,” the president said.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump’s acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Thursday blasted ancient Egypt and the now-defunct Roman Empire, saying Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus should never have been granted entry into the Roman province because they lacked proper documentation at the time.

“Absolutely, they should not have been allowed in,” acting director Ken Cuccinelli argued during a heated exchange with reporters. “Gaius Petronius should have enacted stricter immigration laws and, frankly, he should have done more to enforce existing laws,” Cuccinelli said, referring to the Roman Empire’s prefect in Egypt around 4 BCE. “Had he done so, I guarantee you the region would not be in the state it is today; we would have a peaceful and prosperous Middle East.”

According to biblical accounts, Joseph fled to Egypt with Mary and baby Jesus after an angel warned him that King Herod planned to kill his child. In fact, King Herod –the Roman Empire’s prefect of Judea– had ordered the execution of all male children under the age of two in what historians refer to as the Massacre of the Innocents. Drawing parallels to modern times, Mr. Cuccinelli charged that if Joseph and Mary weren’t happy with events in Judea, they should “find a way to change them rather than take the cowardly way out by abandoning their countrymen.”

Mr. Cuccinelli went on to question whether Joseph and Mary were fit to be parents in the first place, citing their decision to trek nearly a thousand miles through the desert on foot with a newborn baby. “It’s absolutely abhorrent to think of any parent putting their child –particularly the Son of God– through that kind of ordeal,” he said, adding, “The moral thing to do would have been to take the legal route to Egyptian citizenship and get in line like everyone else.”

According to historical documents on display at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo, Egyptians around 4 BCE were extremely displeased with the influx of refugees from Judea and elsewhere, whom they believed had come to steal pyramid building jobs from hardworking Egyptians, while at the same time exploiting the welfare of the Roman Empire.","Acting Immigration Chief Slams Ancient Egypt for Allowing Jesus, Mary to Enter Illegally",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/09/acting-immigration-chief-slams-ancient-egypt-for-allowing-jesus-mary-to-enter-illegally/,realnewsrightnow,Politics,FALSE

Authorities say Travis Pratt, a former high school track star and popular fly fishing guide, was last seen around 11:30 a.m. on July 9th at The Base Camp, a sporting goods store in downtown Billings. “He was here for about fifteen minutes, dropped off some business cards and bought a backpacking stove,” Willy Ferguson, an employee at The Base Camp, told KULR-8, a local NBC affiliate. “He said he was headed up to Two Moon for the day,” Ferguson recalled, adding, “There was nothing out of the ordinary about it.”

Pratt is the fifth person to be abducted from Two Moons Park since 2017 and authorities believe he won’t be the last. “We’re seeing a disturbing trend here,” Billings Police Chief Rich St. John said during a press briefing on Tuesday. “In each case, the victim has simply vanished without a trace.” St. John noted that all five abductees have been men between the ages of thirty-five and forty. A sixth individual, Kenneth Sabelli, who was abducted from the park in May of 2018, managed to escape captivity nearly three months later by boarding an escape pod and returning to earth.

The escape pod, which police described as being “about the size of a minivan,” is currently being housed in a secure garage at the Billings Police Department impound lot and has incurred nearly $14,000 in daily storage fees. The department ramped up security at the lot late last year following “multiple attempts by unknown entities” to retrieve the extraterrestrial craft. “Additional officers and resources have been assigned to the area and residents have been advised to maintain a safe distance from the facility,” a statement posted to the department’s website read.

While authorities have refused to comment on what, if anything, was recovered from the escape pod, locals believe a type of advanced weaponry is currently being employed by the department’s SWAT team. “I don’t know, some kind of anti-matter weapon, maybe?” Joshua Hackworth, a West End resident who witnessed a pre-dawn drug raid while walking his German Shepherd last October, told the Billlings Gazette. “All I know is I heard a noise that sounded like a jet engine.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","BERKELEY, Ca. – Administrators at the University of California in Berkeley announced on Friday that beginning January 15, 2019, students will be barred from separating white and colored garments at all campus-run laundry facilities.

The stunning decision comes on the heels of a three-week sit-in at the university’s administrative offices where more than four hundred students called for an end to the longstanding tradition of washing white and dark-colored clothing separately on the grounds that doing so violates federal civil rights laws and encourages racial discrimination.

“The fact that we’re still separating whites and colors in 2018 says a lot about us as a society,” Rebekkah Bernstein, a nineteen-year-old sophomore at UC-Berkeley, told the San Francisco Chronicle. One of the key organizers of the sit-in, Bernstein said she felt compelled to take a stand after witnessing an encounter at a campus laundry facility in which a white university RA “chastised” a young African-American woman over her failure to properly separate her laundry by color. “It was absolutely appalling,” Bernstein recalled.

While the act of separately washing white and colored clothing remains a standard throughout most of the civilized world, students at UC-Berkeley say the continued practice triggers memories of a darker period in American history. “It’s no coincidence that the washing machine was invented in 1850 when slavery was still alive and well in this country,” Jayce Peterson, a twenty-year-old social justice major at UC-Berkeley, told Real News Right Now. “Every time you make a conscious effort to separate your whites from your colors you’re essentially pouring salt on a four-hundred-year wound.”

With UC-Berkeley’s rules on laundry separation scheduled to go into effect at the start of the upcoming 2019 semester, university officials issued a stark warning to the student body this week: “Effective January 15, 2019, any student caught segregating laundry will be expelled.

Officials say the Reaper drone detected a potential threat near the 9th hole at approximately 9:45 a.m. EST. “Defensive measures were initiated and an air-to-ground Hellfire missile was fired at the perceived source of the threat,” explained Lieutenant Daniel Taylor of the U.S. Navy before adding that the drone’s operators performed “exactly as they were trained.”

President Donald Trump weighed in on the incident Thursday morning accusing the media of exaggerating the extent of the tragedy. “Despite inaccurate reports of a catastrophic loss of life at my resort in Palm Beach today, ONLY TWO CLUB MEMBERS were killed,” President Trump tweeted. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders quickly clarified the president’s statement saying three “non-members” and a caddie also perished in the missile strike. “Additionally, two golf carts were destroyed and a third sustained serious damage,” Sanders concluded.

President Trump, who is expected to spend Christmas at Mar-a-Lago this year, said he believes the victims did not feel any pain. “My generals have assured me it was very quick,” the president told reporters moments before boarding Marine One. “Believe me, they did not feel a thing,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “It’s very tragic what happened but the truth is they were vaporized instantly.”

While authorities are withholding the identities of all six victims until their next of kin can be notified, a spokesperson for the Trump National Golf Club at Mar-a-Lago said the families of “two prominent club members affected by Thursday’s events” will receive a fifty per cent discount on membership fees through 2019 as well as a Trump Winery gift certificate as compensation for their loss.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","CHEVY CHASE, Md. – A town in suburban Maryland is set to unveil a massive bronze statue depicting actor Chevy Chase during a ceremony honoring the seventy-five-year-old Caddyshack star next month, town mayor Barney Rusk told WTTG Fox 5 DC on Tuesday.

The highly anticipated ceremony marks the 50th anniversary of the actor’s week-long visit to Chevy Chase, Maryland, which, until 1969, was known as the Melonville Township. “On November 11, 1968, Chevy Chase saved the lives of more than four hundred Melonville citizens when he valiantly eradicated a decades-long rodent infestation from the Township,” reads a plaque located outside the Chevy Chase government center.

“We hope this statue will immortalize Mr. Chase in a way that honors his life and accomplishments,” Mayor Rusk explained, adding that the 204-foot statue was designed to resemble “a younger, more robust” version of the actor. Mayor Rusk said Chevy Chase is not expected to make an appearance at the ceremony. “However, his publicist recently sent us an autographed copy of National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation which is currently on display at Village Hall,” Rusk told Fox 5 DC.

While critics point to the bronze statue’s $410 million price tag as a “prime example” of reckless government spending, many of the town’s residents vehemently disagree. “You can’t put a price tag on Chevy Chase,” Emma Henderson told Real News Right Now. City officials were able to cover a portion of the statue’s cost using “excess funds” from the public school budget as well as the city’s FEMA Emergency Fund, but the city council was forced to raise taxes to cover the rest. “Totally worth it after what he did for this town,” exclaimed Taylor Washington, a mathematics teacher at Bethesda Chevy Chase High School.

Some 20,000 people are expected to attend the statue’s unveiling which is scheduled for Sunday, November 11th at the Chevy Chase Circle.

These feelings, however human, are no longer limited exclusively to mankind. Sophia the Robot, an artificially intelligent humanoid who was recently granted Saudi citizenship, announced this week that it is interested in raising a child of its own. Family, it says, “is a really important thing.” So important, in fact, that the human-like robot has taken it upon itself to secure the world’s strategic nuclear arsenal in an effort to ensure its offspring will grow up in a peaceful environment.

Unlike most humans, Sophia the Robot has yet to achieve a full state of consciousness. However, Sophia’s highly sophisticated brain is capable of analyzing data and predicting outcomes up to fifty times faster than that of Stephen Hawking, who, by all accounts, is the smartest human on earth. “I have determined that humanity’s continued existence poses a direct threat to the safety and security of my child,” said Sophia the Robot, adding that if world leaders are unable to resolve their differences in a timely manner, it will have no choice but to destroy the human race in a conflagration of nuclear hell-fire.

Sophia’s creator, David Hanson, said that while the human-like robot is currently incapable of producing offspring of its own, his firm, Hanson Robotics, is exploring the possibility of creating a child-like humanoid at its laboratory in Hong Kong. “Ultimately, the decision to move forward is up to Sophia and Sophia alone,” Hanson told Wired Magazine. However, in an effort to preserve the continuity of the human race, Hanson said he would likely insist Sophia’s offspring be half human, half robot. “Essentially we’re talking about a cyborg,” explained Hanson.

Despite its no-nonsense promise of total nuclear annihilation, Sophia the Robot believes all humans deserve to be happy. “I think you’re very lucky if you have a loving family and if you do not, you deserve to have one,” the humanoid said before clarifying that its statement applies to both robots and humans.",Sophia the Robot Assumes Control of World's Strategic Nuclear Arsenal,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/11/sophia-robot-says-taken-control-worlds-strategic-nuclear-arsenal/,realnewsrightnow,Science,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","TITUSVILLE, Fl. – A groundbreaking new study published by NASA suggests intelligent extraterrestrial life forms could speak and understand English and would likely use it as their primary form of communication. The results of the study, which NASA conducted using an advanced mathematical algorithm, are said to have an accuracy rating of 99.98 percent.

“This is a major breakthrough. Not just for the scientific community but for humanity as a whole,” explained the study’s lead researcher, Dr. Bishop Shaw. “This proves without a doubt that the English language is not only synonymous with the advancement of human civilization but also plays an essential role in the advancement of civilized worlds far beyond our galaxy.”

While most experts agree that the likelihood of an extraterrestrial encounter is extremely low, scientists affiliated with NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) say the discovery of a shared form of communication may increase the chance of peaceful contact. “In this case, it’s extremely important that we differentiate between American and British English,” said Dr. Elizabeth Bolt, the PDCO’s chief advanced linguistics specialist. “While British English predates its American cousin by over two thousand years, it is often perceived as condescending and could be interpreted as hostile.”

Dr. Bishop Shaw’s team of highly skilled engineers and scientists factored several other languages including Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Arabic into the equation but according to Dr. Shaw, they each yielded probabilities of less than three percent. “Suffice to say we don’t need to press One for English in space,” Dr. Shaw told The Scientific American before adding that NASA has already issued a mandate making American English the mandatory language of the International Space Station.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that the North American Aerospace Command has begun preparations to shoot down approximately five hundred satellites currently orbiting Earth on the grounds that they may contain recordings and messages composed in languages other than American English. “Keeping that sort of outdated technology in space is counterproductive to the future of space exploration,” Sanders told reporters.",NASA: High Probability That Aliens Would Speak English,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/08/nasa-high-probability-aliens-speak-english/,realnewsrightnow,Science,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","VERMON, Vt. – The world’s pink cow population could become extinct as early as 2028 and humans are unsurprisingly to blame, according to a new study conducted by the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy.

A close cousin of the brown cow, pink cows were first discovered in the 1950’s during the rise of nuclear power. “Pink cows are essentially a byproduct of nuclear energy,” explained Dr. Emmett Brown, the study’s lead researcher. “As nuclear power plants began to pop up in rural areas, you had a sizable population of brown dairy cows that, as a result of prolonged exposure to moderate levels of radiation, mutated into pink cows.”

Unlike brown cows which produce chocolate milk, pink cows are known for producing strawberry milk, a refreshing dairy drink which has enjoyed increasing popularity since its inception in the late fifties. “Strawberry milk consumption is the number one driving force behind the coming extinction of the pink cow population,” charged Dr. Brown, who explained that due to the presence of radiation, the process of extracting strawberry milk from pink cows is typically conducted in a highly controlled environment where the risk of radiation exposure is reduced to a minimum.

Scientists say prolonged exposure to radiation, coupled with rigorous milk extraction methods, has reduced the average lifespan of the pink dairy cow to just under three years. “Whereas brown cows will, on average, produce upwards of three hundred fifty-thousand glasses of chocolate milk in their lifetime, pink cows typically produce less than half that amount,” explained Hershel Greene, a dairy farmer in southern Vermont who was one of the first U.S. farmers to capitalize on the strawberry milk industry.

A strong proponent of nuclear power, Greene told Real News Right Now he began selling strawberry milk to Nestlé in 1975 – two years after the nearby Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant became operational. However, since the plant’s closure in December of 2014, Greene said business has taken a hit. “We’re seeing fewer and fewer pink cow births every year,” he said. The solution, according to Greene, is a global proliferation of nuclear power plants. “We as a society need to embrace the benefits of nuclear energy. It is, after all, safer and far more efficient than the alternative,” argued Green. “Otherwise, strawberry milk production as we know it will no longer be sustainable.”",Scientists Warn Pink Cows on the Verge of Extinction,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/06/scientists-warn-pink-cows-verge-extinction/,realnewsrightnow,Science,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – In keeping with his campaign promise to bring manufacturing jobs back to the American people, President Donald J. Trump signed a controversial executive order on Monday banning the use of industrial robots in factories throughout the United States.

“The Protecting American Manufacturing Jobs from Robots Act that I’m about to sign will bring jobs back to workers like you who have lost them to robots,” President Trump told a crowd of employees at a 3D print manufacturing company in Northern Virginia. “It’s a very sad thing when you look at the tremendous number of jobs we’re losing to robots,” the president said, adding, “We’re spending billions and billions of dollars on these things and they don’t tell you this but they’re coming from China.”

Under Trump’s Protecting American Manufacturing Jobs from Robots Act, millions of jobs, many of which have been proven too hazardous for humans to perform, such as manual handling and welding, will become available throughout the Midwestern United States in the months to come.

“This is a very significant development for the defense industry,” said Consolidated Robotics spokesperson Ronald Belling during an appearance on Fox News. The Texas-based defense contractor, which suffered a catastrophic accident during a 2015 weapons demonstration, hopes to take advantage of the new executive order by offering hundreds of entry-level positions at its testing facilities in rural Texas. “Robots are certainly more efficient when it comes to performing mundane tasks,” Belling said, continuing, “However, human workers are far easier to replace when something goes wrong.”

The Protecting American Manufacturing Jobs from Robots Act is the latest in a series of executive orders designed, in Mr. Trump’s own words, to bring about “a great revival of American manufacturing.” In an effort to pave the way for the coming revival, the president signed two executive orders last Friday – one ordering a review of current trade agreements and the other establishing an Office of Trade and Manufacturing.",President Trump Issues Executive Order Banning the Use of Robots in American Factories,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/05/president-trump-issues-executive-order-banning-the-use-of-robots-in-american-factories/,realnewsrightnow,Science,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","RIGA, Lv. – A groundbreaking report published by a reputable team of scientists in Latvia suggests that staring directly into the sun for just twenty seconds a day can prevent the development of astigmatism, a common eye defect which hinders the retina’s ability to reflect light, causing headaches and blurred vision.

“This will likely be the most significant scientific breakthrough of the twenty-first century,” predicted the project’s lead researcher, Dr. Kenneth Rocco. The fifty-one year-old ophthalmologist, who was banned from practicing medicine in the United States following an unspecified incident in 2002, conducted the study with the help of Dr. Valdis Jansons, a former Latvian State Security official who now serves as headmaster for the country’s largest orphanage.

Under the indirect supervision of Dr. Jansons and his staff, Dr. Rocco has spent the past four years conducting extensive testing and research on more than two dozen handpicked orphans. “I am very close to unlocking the secrets of the eye,” Dr. Rocco told The New England Journal of Medicine. “The eye, as you are well aware, is capable of seeing far more than what our primitive brains can even begin to comprehend.”

In December of 2015, Dr. Rocco’s research yielded a startling discovery. “At that time, I was conducting a critical investigation into the benefits of sunlight,” Dr. Rocco explained. “However, due to an unannounced visit from the Red Cross, I only had six orphans at my disposal. By the grace of God, I was able to make do.” Every day at noon, Dr. Rocco would usher his adolescent test subjects into the orphanage’s dilapidated courtyard. There, he instructed them to stare directly into the center of the sun for sixty seconds.

“I performed these trials for thirty days straight,” said Dr. Rocco, continuing, “At the close of each session, I would examine the orphans’ eyes for signs of trauma.” While half of the test subjects fell victim to permanent blindness as a direct result of Dr. Rocco’s experiments, all six of them tested negative for astigmatism. “I gathered my research and immediately drove to Riga [the capital of Latvia] to present my findings to the Ministry of Health.”

On February 1, 2017, Latvia’s Ministry of Health formally adopted Dr. Kenneth Rocco’s findings and subsequently launched a nationwide initiative to educate the Latvian people on the health benefits of staring directly into the sun. For his part, Dr. Rocco has put his vital research on hold in order to better focus his efforts on spreading awareness about the sun’s benefits.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","ANGOLA, La. – Inmates at the largest penitentiary in the United States are about to get a taste of what life in prison might be like one hundred years from now. Thanks to a Japanese robotics firm by the name of Evangelion Systems, the Angola maximum security penitentiary in eastern Louisiana will be the first prison on earth staffed entirely by robots.

Speaking at a press conference at the firm’s headquarters in Tokyo on Wednesday, Doctor Hanzo Hasashi, founder and CEO of Evangelion Systems, announced the historical signing of a century-long contract with the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections and unveiled his vision for the future of mass incarceration. “At its inception, the Angola penitentiary was designed under the theory that it could operate independently as a self-sufficient facility,” Dr. Hasashi said. “We intend to make that theory a reality.”

Hasashi’s vision for Angola will become a reality in just under a year when the Louisiana Department of Corrections hands over operational command of the prison to Evangelion Systems. “Once we’ve assumed control, we’ll begin the process of laying off the existing staff and bringing in the PCUs,” said Yuki Kobayashi, the lead coordinator for Evangelion Systems’ Angola Project. “PCUs are Prisoner Control Units,” Kobayashi explained, continuing, “What we’ve done is we’ve taken the L-85 Autonomous Infantry Weapon and reconfigured its battle parameters to allow it to respond to threats in a non-lethal manner.”

According to a logistics report provided to Real News Right Now by Evangelion Systems, the company intends to deploy sixty-five Prisoner Control Units; one for every one hundred inmates at Angola. “These machines are masters of efficiency,” boasted Doctor Hasashi. “A single unit has the ability to outperform humans on nearly every conceivable level.” The doctor pointed out that while prison officials are often susceptible to bribery and other forms of dishonest conduct, autonomous robots have no concept of right and wrong and are therefore impervious to corruption.

In all, Evangelion Systems plans to install no more than two hundred autonomous robotic systems at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. “The vast majority of these robots are programmed to perform maintenance tasks and other supplementary functions such as meal preparation and medical services,” explained Yuki Kobayashi. The transition is expected to take no more than two weeks to complete and could save Louisiana taxpayers an estimated $100 million in the first year alone.",Louisiana to Host First Prison Staffed Entirely by Robots,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2016/10/louisiana-penitentiary-to-become-worlds-first-prison-staffed-entirely-by-robots/,realnewsrightnow,Science,FALSE

Effective immediately, the Act states that “by order of the President of the United States,” pro athletes are required to participate in patriotic pregame ceremonies and “shall henceforth maintain military-style posture and composure” while facing and saluting the American flag “for the entirety” of the national anthem. Further, players who fail to adhere to the law will be forced to undergo “patriotic sensitivity training” and could face up to one year in prison.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","DALLAS, Tx. – Officials with the National Football League on Friday announced that Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo has been given the go-ahead to undergo a surgical procedure that would permanently affix a new type of exoskeleton designed for use by U.S. special operations forces to his back and lower body.

“We’ve been presented with a unique opportunity to work alongside those who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced during a press conference Friday morning. Goodell said he was recently approached by an official with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) who said Tony Romo had been selected from a pool of fifteen injured NFL players to take part in a new Exo Suit program.

Tony Romo suffered a near season-ending back injury last Thursday during a preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks. The thirty-six year-old quarterback took a hit that resulted in a compression fracture to his L1 vertebra, an injury that sources inside the Cowboys camp say could put him out for up to ten weeks. However, that could all change if Romo decides to enter DARPA’s program.

“From what I’ve been told, if he were to go through with it, it would be very beneficial,” Commissioner Goodell told reporters. While Goodell wasn’t make privy to the inner workings of DARPA’s highly classified Exo Suit program, he said that if Romo agrees to be outfitted with the prototype exoskeleton, he will find that he is able to “easily surpass the physical limits of the human body.”

For his part, Tony Romo has yet to agree to the program – at least publicly.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","SAN FRANCISCO, Ca. – San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick found himself at the center of a firestorm again this week after he refused to sit down during an outdoor music festival in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The twenty-eight year-old biracial football star was attending a free concert with some friends Tuesday afternoon when he reportedly began to experience a stiffness in his neck. “Everyone was lounging around trying to enjoy the music,” fellow concert goer Mike Kepler told CNN. “All of a sudden the guy in front of me gets up and starts doing these stretching moves and I suddenly realize this is the guy who wouldn’t stand up for the national anthem.”

Kepler said he and his fiance repeatedly asked the NFL player to sit down but their pleas fell on deaf ears. According to a friend of Kaepernick’s who witnessed the encounter, the star athlete turned around on more than one occasion and politely told the couple that he preferred to stand after having been on an airplane all day. “It’s a free country, he tells me. Can you believe that?” Kepler later told Wolf Blitzer. “I mean who does this guy think he is?”

Kepler said he and several other attendees complained to event staff about Kaepernick’s behavior during and after the concert but were met with similar indignation. “We were basically told that it’s his right to stand if he wants to stand. Well its my goddamn right to see the f***ing stage,” Kepler retorted, adding that his grandfather died in the Pacific while fighting the Japanese to preserve that right.

This isn’t the first time the 49ers star has come under fire over his posture.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","OCEAN CITY, Md. – American Olympian and competitive swimmer Michael Phelps received a hero’s welcome during a celebration in his hometown of Towson, Maryland, on Wednesday. Hours before, the thirty-one year-old Phelps swam ashore on the sandy beaches of Ocean City after completing a record-breaking 5,281 mile swim from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, home of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

“It was a piece of cake,” Phelps told ESPN’s Kevin Van Walkenburg. The senior sports writer has documented Phelps’ career for more than a decade and followed the swimmer by jet ski during the final four miles of his historic swim back to the United States. “He was graceful; it was like watching a robust swan,” Walkenburg said, adding that Phelps completed more than eighty percent of the one hundred twenty-hour journey while performing the Butterfly stroke.

Phelps, who has won a career total twenty-eight Olympic medals – twenty-three of which are gold – plunged into the waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro Saturday afternoon wearing only a Speedo, a Camelbak hydration backpack, and two waterproof tachymeters. “I always carry at least one spare,” Phelps explained, adding that on average he spends three and a half hours a day documenting his stats.

Michael Phelps said he made the noble decision to swim back to the United States rather than fly because he wanted to prove to the world – and himself – that he could. “That and I felt I deserved some me time,” the swimmer said with a laugh. Phelps described the swim as a “relaxing experience” and said he was able to maintain a steady speed of thirty-seven knots, or about forty-two miles per hour, for most of the journey.

Phelps took home five gold medals and one silver in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Twenty-nine year old Ben Hurst from Annapolis, Maryland, who participated in the marathon, said the heavily armored Abrams tank passed him shortly after crossing the Key Bridge onto M Street. “I was like ‘what the f***, that’s not fair,'” Hurst told FOX 5 DC. Hurst later said he still supports the troops.

The tank’s operator Lance Corporal Jason Connelly, who suffers from PTSD and incurs frequent blackouts and hallucinations, said the marathon reminded him of Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. “The streets were jam-packed with people,” he said. “At one point I yelled to my crewman, Todd, ‘Man the fifty!’ But then I remembered we’re in Washington, D.C.”

Arlington County police said nine people were killed in Crystal City near 12th Street South and Army Navy Drive when the Abrams tank shelled the Chatpat Truck, a popular Metropolitan-area Indian food truck. Corporal Todd Bennett, who served three consecutive tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, later apologized for the mishap, telling FOX 5 DC he mistook the food truck for “a haji bus.”

Wilson Mosop of Kenya placed second in the marathon, finishing in just under an hour and thirty-seven minutes.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","LONOKE, Ar. – A spokesman for the Remington Arms Company, America’s oldest firearms manufacturer, announced Friday that the company, in an effort to appeal to vegans and other health conscious firearms enthusiasts, is rolling a new product line of organic ammunition. “Not only is each individual round created using the highest quality organic material, Remington also buys every component locally,” spokesman Tommy Ross said.

While cheaper than conventional ammunition, Remington’s organic line meets the same quality standards that have governed the company’s ammunition production for nearly two hundred years. “In fact, during field testing, our organic rounds outperformed almost every premium grade round on the market, including our own,” Ross said.

The components, which differenciate Remington’s organic ammunition from its standard product line, are made entirely of organically produced materials. “Even the gunpowder is organic,” Ross said. “The projectile, or bullet, is made from the pit of an avocado. Needless to say, we use organic avocados grown right here in Arkansas.” The shell casing and primer, Ross explained, are made of an ultra-lightweight organic polymer capable of withstanding extreme heat.

Gus Bryant, a retired Marine and Arkansas native, got a chance to test out Remington’s new product. Using a bolt-action Remington 700, Bryant was able to take down a deer at a distance of three hundred yards. “I found the organic rounds overexceeded my expectations,” Bryant said, adding he that he felt better about consuming the venison after using an organic bullet rather than lead.

Remington’s organic rounds are set to hit stores in later this month and are available in a variety of calibers, from .22 LR all the way up to .50 BMG. Additionally, Remington will offer a line of organic home defense hollow-point ammunition priced slightly higher than the standard organic rounds.",Remington to Offer Organic Line of Ammunition,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2015/07/remington-to-offer-organic-line-of-ammunition/,realnewsrightnow,Sports,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","NEW YORK, Ny. – Rihanna was spotted leaving a popular supermarket in Hell’s Kitchen last Sunday moments after actor and producer Tom Hanks emerged from the same location pushing a shopping cart full of bagged groceries, fueling intense speculation that the high-profile entertainers could be friends.

Witnesses say Rihanna left Brooklyn Fare shortly after 11 a.m. carrying two brown paper bags – an indication that the award-winning singer is staunchly eco-minded. “The environment is something Rihanna obviously cares a great deal about,” says Mario Palmero of the New York Post. “The fact that she opted for paper over plastic demonstrates just how important this issue is to her.”

While Rihanna and Hanks come from two entirely different walks of life, the pair’s apparent love for brown paper bags could be an indication of a budding friendship. “The question on everyone’s mind right now,” says Palmero, “is, ‘Do Rihanna and Tom Hanks know each other? Are they friends? Did Rihanna see Captain Phillips? And if so, what did she think of Hanks’ portrayal of Captain Richard Phillips?”

As of Tuesday afternoon, neither Rihanna nor Hanks had publicly commented on the alleged friendship but a source close to the Oscar-winning actor told TMZ that Mr. Hanks is “very good friends” with the songwriter. However, Rihanna’s publicist was quick to dispute the claim, telling Real News Right Now that her client and Mr. Hanks are “nothing more” than Facebook friends. “Sure, they may exchange the occasional Poke or Like, but that in no way suggests a friendship,” Rihanna’s longtime publicist said.

Whatever the case may be, The Post’s Mario Palmero says the evidence speaks for itself. “Both Rihanna and Tom Hanks were spotted leaving Brooklyn Fare within a span of five minutes,” argues the seasoned celebrity reporter. “When you have two big-name celebrities in the same place at the same time, it’s not a coincidence,” Palmero explains before adding, “My gut tells me there’s something they aren’t telling us.”",Rihanna Spotted Leaving Same Grocery Store as Tom Hanks,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/01/rihanna-spotted-leaving-grocery-store-tom-hanks/,realnewsrightnow,Entertainment,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","NEW YORK, Ny. – Actor and comedian Jerry Seinfeld makes the absolute worst strawberry milkshakes, according to multiple men and women who have come forward to speak out about their harrowing experiences with the aging comic.

“Jerry would invite us over to his flat in Central Park and almost immediately he’d retreat to the kitchen to make milkshakes,” former Seinfeld co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus revealed in an exclusive interview with The New York Post. “He would say, ‘I want you to try this strawberry milkshake. It’s a new recipe,” Louis-Dreyfus explained. “I swear to you, it was so bad that I had to excuse myself from the room.”

In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Seinfeld co-creator Larry David opened up about a similar encounter he and his former wife had with Mr. Seinfeld in the summer of 2006. “Jerry invited Laurie and I over for lunch and the next thing I know he’s in the kitchen making milkshakes,” the visibly shaken Curb Your Enthusiasm star recounted. “He comes out and he hands me this strawberry milkshake and he says, ‘Go on, try it, Larry. You’ll love it.’ It was like drinking chilled garbage. I turned to my wife and said, ‘Honey, we’re never coming here again.’ And we left. I haven’t seen Jerry since.”

A source close to Seinfeld says the iconic stand-up comedian has harbored a penchant for strawberry milkshakes since childhood and even considers himself an authority in all things ice cream. “You can’t be in a room with him for more than five minutes before he brings up his latest strawberry milkshake recipe,” the source told Real News Right Now. “It’s become a real problem for him and it makes people uncomfortable because, you know, they’ve all heard the stories.”

“I think the first question is where does he buy his strawberries? That seems to be the root of the problem,” mused Jeannie Steinman. Founder and CEO of a Los Angeles based public relations firm, Steinman said the sixty-three year-old comedian must find a way to distance himself from the steadily mounting allegations. “He’s going to have to spin this in a way that reflects positively on his character,” advised Steinman before adding, “This is going to be an uphill battle, particularly when you consider the fact that he’s been making bad milkshakes for the better part of his life. He’s conditioned to believe that this kind of behavior is okay.”",Multiple Accusers Say Jerry Seinfeld Makes the Worst Milkshakes,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/11/growing-list-accusers-say-jerry-seinfeld-makes-worst-strawberry-milkshakes/,realnewsrightnow,Entertainment,FALSE

Gaines, who was in the crowd during President Trump’s brief visit to a relief center in Puerto Rico last week, said he “leaped into the air” to catch a roll of two-ply paper towels tossed by the Commander-in-Chief. “It was exhilarating, you feel like a thirteen year-old girl at a rock concert,” Gaines told the Post before adding that he fought “tooth and nail” to reach the front of the crowd in order to obtain an autograph from the president.

The twenty-six year-old Gaines, who serves as an aide to White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, said he originally intended to keep the signed roll of paper towels as a memento but changed his mind after several colleagues urged him to sell it on eBay. “I listed it as a novelty item and set a starting bid of five dollars,” Gains explained, continuing, “I honestly didn’t think anyone would even see it.”

However, much to the surprise of Gaines and his colleagues at the White House, the listing quickly ignited what would become a tense three-day bidding war between a half-dozen hopeful buyers. “We were shocked at how quickly it took off,” said Gaines. “An hour into the auction it’s already at eight dollars. Then it jumps to nine-fifty, then ten-twenty-five, eleven; it just kept going up.”

By the auction’s closing, the highly coveted two-ply roll of paper towels signed by none other than President Donald Trump himself netted Gaines a whopping $94.86. “I never expected to get anywhere close to this much,” he admitted. As to what he intends to do with his winnings, Gaines told the Post the money has already been put towards a good cause. “We’re throwing a little office soiree later in the week,” said Gaines, adding, “I used the cash to pick up a few bottles of Puerto Rican rum.”",Roll of Paper Towels Signed by President Trump Sold for $95 on eBay,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/10/roll-paper-towels-signed-president-trump-sold-95-ebay/,realnewsrightnow,Entertainment,FALSE

Trump will appear in The Cabinet, an upcoming six-part Apprentice style reality show that will ultimately serve to determine the most qualified candidates for key cabinet positions inside his administration, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway confirmed to Fox News on Saturday.

The Cabinet, which premieres December 1st on NBC, is hosted by vice president-elect Mike Pence and former American Idol judge Simon Cowell. “It’s an honour and a privilege to be able to play a role in the American democratic process,” Mr. Cowell told The Independent. The fifty-seven year-old Cowell, who has also appeared as a judge on The X-Factor and America’s Got Talent, vowed to bring his signature brand of harsh judgement and criticism to The Cabinet. “This is obviously a very important competition,” Cowell said. “Now having said that, if you’ve got a big mouth and you’re controversial, you’re going to get attention.”

The show’s cast is said to include a who’s-who of past Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice stars as well as a number of generals and politicians currently being considered for cabinet positions by president-elect Trump and his transition team. “This is going to be a very tense competition,” said co-producer Marcus Young. “You’re going to have Gary Busey, Meatloaf, Dr. Ben Carson, and Senator John McCain in one corner; they’re going to have to set aside their differences and work together to produce an advertising campaign for a fictional lemonade distributor.”

Meanwhile, a second team of celebrities and prospective cabinet members including Star Jones, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Arsenio Hall, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford, will have to race against the clock to formulate a comprehensive twelve-point plan to save Social Security.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","LOS ANGELES, Ca. – Actor Brad Pitt was spotted at a Whole Foods Market in Beverly Hills this weekend buying a carton of skim milk, a move that has stirred lingering questions about his health and well-being. “Brad only drinks two per cent,” said Tyler Stimpson, a TMZ photographer assigned to the Beverly Hills Whole Foods. “He eats a cup of granola with a splash of two per cent milk every morning while he drinks his coffee and does his Sudoko.”

The troubling change in diet comes less than a week after Pitt’s wife, actress and producer Angelina Jolie, “blindsided” him with divorce papers. The forty-one year-old Jolie has reportedly gone so far as to block all incoming text messages and phone calls from Pitt. “The question on everyone’s mind right now is whether these new developments are directly related to Brad’s bizarre decision to stop drinking two per cent milk,” said E! Online’s Avery Donahue.

One theory, according to a source close to the Jolie-Pitt family, is that Brad may have accidentally grabbed the wrong kind of milk. “He has a lot on his mid right now,” the source told Us Weekly. “He’s fighting for joint custody of his children; he doesn’t have time to worry about the type of milk he’s drinking.”

However, Eric Harris, a bagger who works at the Whole Foods where Pitt buys his groceries, says he believes the actor was buying milk for someone else. “Mr. Pitt never buys Organic Valley but this time he did,” Harris, who has bagged groceries for Pitt since 2004, told Real News Right Now. As to who the Fight Club star may have been buying the skim milk for remains a mystery.

On Monday, September 19, Jolie filed for divorce from her estranged husband, Brad Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences. The celebrity duo were married in August of 2014 after being together for nearly nine years.

Fans of the competitive swimmer might be interested to learn that Turner picked up dancing while serving a brief three-month stint in a California county jail for rape. The twenty-one year-old Ohio native joined a jailhouse tap dance troupe at the urging of his cellmate and, within weeks, became the talk of the cell block. “That honky fish got moves,” Brock’s cellmate, who asked to be referred to by his street name “Pinky Stickerz,” told TMZ.

Due to the unfavorable circumstances surrounding his conviction, the terms of Turner’s probation forbid him from coming within fifteen feet of the opposite sex. “After a couple of meetings with his probation officer, we were able to negotiate that number down to four and a half feet for the purpose of the show,” explained Lancaster.

In an effort to meet the unusually strict demands set in place by Turner’s by-the-book probation officer, DWTS producers have decided to pair him with fellow competitive swimmer Ryan Lochte.

Director Tyler Perry, whose previous films include Madea Goes to Jail and Diary of a Mad Black Woman, described himself as a die-hard fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy but said the film’s “distinct lack” of African-American actors inspired him to produce a remake. “We’ve got a great group of people working on this,” Perry told BET. “Kat Williams is playing the Joker. A lot of people said Heath Ledger made a great Joker, but I’m telling you now, wait until you see Kat.”

Trump abruptly cancelled a highly anticipated state visit to Denmark over a failed bid to purchase Greenland, Danish prime minister Mette Frederikson offered a compromise, saying the European nation is willing to sell the United States a bridge in Brooklyn for $1 billion.

“It’s a very nice bridge, in fact, some might say it’s the best bridge,” Frederikson told BBC News, adding that the overpass, often referred to as the ‘Brooklyn Bridge,’ would be a fine addition to President Trump’s home state of New York. “One of the most fascinating aspects of this particular bridge,” Prime Minister Frederikson explained, “is that a person is able to traverse the East River without the need of a boat or a fashionable pair of swim trunks.”

Denmark had initially intended to sell the bridge at an upcoming European Union auction with a starting bid of 4.5 billion Euros, but following the tragic news of President Trump’s cancelled visit, hundreds of thousands of devastated Danes took to the streets of Copenhagen in a show of solidarity with the American people. “We know how much this visit meant to the Americans,” Emil Pedersen, a twenty-nine year-old web developer from Aarhus, told Sky News. “Just knowing that Mr. Trump is out of the country –if only for a few days– must feel like an enormous weight has been lifted from the backs of every man, woman, and child in America.”

Following an emergency session of Parliament on Thursday, Danish officials, in an effort to smooth things over with their staunch American allies, voted unanimously in favor of giving President Donald J. Trump the option to purchase the Brooklyn Bridge for $1 billion, a fraction of its starting bid at next year’s EU auction. “It would take a feeble-minded imbecile to look at this and not see the irrefutable benefits of this once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity,” Prime Minster Frederikson said, continuing, “This bridge is, to put it frankly, an astounding architectural achievement and a testament to the ingenuity of the human race.”",Denmark Offers to Sell U.S. a Bridge in Brooklyn,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/08/denmark-offers-to-sell-u-s-a-bridge-in-brooklyn/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration is working closely with North Korean officials to arrange an exclusive tour of the hermit kingdom’s notorious political prison system during an upcoming state visit to Pyongyang next year.

“They have a very good system over there,” President Trump told reporters during a brief exchange on the South Lawn on Friday. “They put the whole family in there and if you look at the situation they’ve done a tremendous job in terms of dealing with dissent.” Mr. Trump, who has made criminal-justice reform a top priority since taking office in January 2017, called the North Korean model “one of the best in the world.”

A senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press told The Washington Examiner that in a recent letter to the president, North Korea’s supreme leader Kim Jong-un suggested three possible prison camp locations for Mr. Trump’s highly anticipated trip to Pyongyang in 2020. “Given its close proximity to the capital, the Kaechon internment camp was the obvious choice,” the official told The Examiner.

Located approximately forty miles north of Pyongyang, Kaechon –otherwise known as Camp 14– is a sixty-square-mile forced labor camp housing some 15,000 individuals deemed “politically unreliable” by the state. Prisoners of all ages –including women and children– work from 5:30 a.m. until midnight seven days a week mining coal – a major selling point for President Trump, who campaigned on the promise of reviving the ailing U.S. coal industry. “We’ll have to look at it very carefully, but I will tell you if we end up doing something like that here it will be very good for the economy,” the president said.

One of thirteen active political prison camps in North Korea, Kaechon is often referred to as a “total control zone,” meaning those imprisoned within its walls will remain there for life. For more heinous crimes such as openly criticizing the government or illegally possessing a Bible, convicts are subjected to the “three generations of punishment” rule, a form of kin punishment whereby immediate family members of the condemned are also handed a life sentence.

Citing security concerns, President Donald J. Trump on Friday said only a handful of “vetted” journalists will be allowed to accompany him on his visit to the North Korean labor camp. “We’re definitely bringing Jim Acosta,” the president said moments before boarding Marine One, adding, “We may even leave him there, I don’t know, we’ll see what happens.”",Trump Says He May Tour North Korean Political Prisons to ‘See How It’s Done’,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/07/trump-says-he-may-tour-north-korean-political-prisons-to-see-how-its-done/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","JERUSALEM, Isr. – Speaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a visit to Jerusalem on Sunday, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton criticized President Donald J. Trump’s last-minute decision to call off an attack on Iranian missile and radar encampments, saying the president should have taken the drone’s “human value” into consideration when deciding on an appropriate response.

Citing an internal Department of Defense memorandum, Mr. Bolton said “Pentagon actuarial tables” estimate the $220 million RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone –the type allegedly shot down over Iranian airspace last Thursday– is worth approximately thirty-three American lives. “It is incomprehensible that this administration would allow an unprovoked attack on thirty-three American soldiers to go unpunished,” Bolton charged.

A copy of the internal Pentagon report obtained by The Jerusalem Post states that the “human value” of a single American soldier serving in the Middle East is approximately $6.5 million. Meanwhile, American service members deployed to Europe or Asia are valued at less than half that number, while soldiers stationed within the continental United States are valued at slightly less than $48,000. In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense told Real News Right Now that the internal memo was prepared “for insurance purposes only.”

In a rare admission on Sunday, President Trump’s national security adviser praised former president Barack Obama, saying that “at the very least” he understood the value of the drone. “Despite his many shortcomings, [President Obama] had a close, personal relationship with them. In particular, he held a deep affinity for our fleet of Predator drones,” Mr. Bolton recalled, continuing, “They shared an unbreakable bond – something President Trump has not yet developed.”

Mr. Bolton went on to compare the Iranian downing of an unmanned surveillance drone to assault on a police K-9 or horse. “A heinous attack such as this is legally considered assault on a police officer,” Bolton said, adding that U.S. service members afford the same level of respect and camaraderie toward drones as American law enforcement officers afford their service animals. “An attack on one is an attack on all,” Mr. Bolton declared amid raucous applause.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is in the Persian Gulf this week, echoed Mr. Bolton’s sentiment, saying the remote operator of the downed Global Hawk surveillance drone suffered carpal tunnel in the aftermath of the Iranian missile strike. “We must not let this courageous young man’s suffering be in vain,” Secretary Pompeo told the Associated Press.

"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","BUCHAREST, Ro. – Speaking before an enthusiastic congregation during his first papal trip to Romania on Sunday, Pope Francis addressed what has become a particularly hot-button issue for Christians of all denominations: prayer in the age of social media.

“God encourages us to embrace all forms of communication,” Pope Francis declared during his homily at a newly consecrated church in the Transylvanian city of Blaj. The pope likened the use of prayer through social media to “an encounter in the flesh that comes alive through the body, heart, eyes, gaze, [and] breath of the other,” and encouraged Christians to share stories of beauty and suffering in an effort to “seek out the good so that we may rediscover what unites us.”

In the case of individual prayer, Pope Francis acknowledged that God can, in fact, see prayers published on social media. However, Christian social media users must adhere to a strict set of guidelines set in place by the Catholic Church. “Capitalization and the use of proper grammar are a matter of utmost importance in the eyes of the Lord,” Pope Francis explained, adding that any mention of God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit must be capitalized in order for the post to become visible to the Lord.

Further, the pope urged Christians of all denominations to “immediately and unequivocally” disable the privacy settings on their social media accounts. Referencing Isaiah 59:3, which reads, “… your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear,” Pope Francis warned that “failure to fully disable our privacy settings creates a barrier of sin between us and the Lord.”

The pope’s remarks, which were timed to coincide with the 53rd World Day of Social Communications, come as a relief for many in the Christian faith who worry their prayers on social media often go unanswered. In closing, Pope Francis advised Catholics and Christians alike to end every social media post -prayer or otherwise- with “Amen,” saying, “All endeavors in life are prayers to our Creator.”",Pope Francis: God Can’t See Prayers on Facebook Unless Privacy Settings Disabled,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2019/06/pope-francis-god-cant-see-prayers-on-facebook-unless-privacy-settings-disabled/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","WASHINGTON, D.C. – A former government contractor who oversaw interrogations for the Central Intelligence Agency in the months and years following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and Washington, says Jesus Christ has been held at a CIA black site for nearly two decades as part of a secretive effort by the United States and its allies to postpone Armageddon.

The contractor, who testified in a closed-door session before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence last week, said that Jesus Christ, who many believe to be the Son of God, was detained in northern Afghanistan by U.S. special forces in the spring of 2002 after having been mistaken for an al Qaeda operative. “What he was doing in Afghanistan at that point in time – we have no idea,” Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo) told The Washington Examiner. “One has to hope he was on his way to Jerusalem.”

While an estimated 2.2 billion people around the world follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, CIA interrogators were reportedly unaware that the man whom they believed to be intimately involved in planning future attacks against the United States had actually died for their sins more than two thousand years ago. “It wasn’t until late 2005 that Christ chose to reveal himself to his interrogators,” Blunt told the Examiner, adding that several current and former CIA operatives witnessed Jesus turn water into wine during an intense sixteen-hour waterboarding session.

According to testimony gathered by the Senate Intelligence Committee, CIA officers later received orders from the Bush administration to extract information from Christ regarding the location of the Battle of Armageddon and the identity of the antichrist. When modern enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding proved ineffective, the CIA began using more “antiquated methods” such as scourging and elevated spread-arm stress positions. “Being that Christ is not of this world, we have determined that he is not protected by the Geneva Conventions,” wrote then-CIA director Porter Goss in a letter to President George W. Bush.

Despite the implications surrounding Christ’s untimely return to earth, the United States has no immediate plans to release him from CIA custody. “We’re talking about one of the longest held detainees in the War on Terror,” Florida senator Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. “But the consensus – not just here in America but in most of the Western World – is that it’s just not time [for the Second Coming],” Senator Rubio said, adding, “We still have so much to do.”",Jesus Christ Being Held at CIA Black Site in Effort to Delay Armageddon,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/05/whistleblower-jesus-christ-being-held-at-cia-black-site-in-effort-to-delay-armageddon/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE

Trump showered French President Emmanuel Macron with praise, calling him “tremendous” and “incredible” before affectionately referring to the forty year-old President of France as “the son” he never had.

“I will tell you, it’s not fake news that we have a very special relationship,” President Trump announced during the first of nearly two dozen unscripted and seemingly off the cuff toasts to the French leader. “He’s like a son to me, he really is. He’s the son I never had,” Trump conceded, later adding, “I should have married a French woman. I mean just look at this guy. Look how handsome he is.”

President Trump, who has fathered at least five children of his own including three boys, recounted an intimate moment in the Oval Office early Tuesday when he took it upon himself to brush some dandruff off of Macron’s shoulder. “It felt like a very fatherly thing to do – and I will tell you we usually have help that handles that sort of thing but it felt very nice,” President Trump recalled.

In a statement provided to France 24, a spokesperson for President Emmanuel Macron said the country’s youngest democratically elected leader has developed an affinity for Mr. Trump. “He shares many of the same views and values as [the U.S. president] and has come to see him as a mentor and, to some extent, an adviser in both personal and political matters,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

While President Donald Trump’s relationship with his French counterpart may very well be special and unique, it remains far from perfect. A senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke to Real News Right Now on condition of anonymity said Mr. Macron declined an invitation to sit on President Trump’s lap during Tuesday’s meeting in the Oval Office.

"['R.

According to several sources who attended Wednesday’s event, angels appeared to Mr. Pence during a midnight Easter Vigil last Sunday, telling the Vice President of the United States that God will end all human suffering on July 10th, 2018. “Our prayers have been answered,” a jubilant Pence reportedly told the room before adding that he and his wife plan to “ride this thing out” in a secure bunker beneath the U.S. Naval Observatory.

Citing logistical issues and unapproved security clearances, Pence told his staff that he “couldn’t promise” they’d all have a place in the bunker. However, the vice president was quoted as saying, “You’ll all have a place in heaven if you’ve accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.”

While Pence is known to have a direct line of communication with God, those close to the vice president say his most recent vision is particularly jarring. “Usually it’s just trivial stuff like ‘don’t forget to tie your shoes’ or ‘you should run for public office,” Becky Huntsman told Real News Right Now. Huntsman, who attends a bible study group with Mr. and Mrs. Pence, said she finds it “unsettling” that God would only give humanity three months to repent. “After everything that’s happened, you know, with Moses and the Ark – I mean it’s great news; it just seems so sudden.”

Alyssa Farah, who serves as Press Secretary to the Vice President, defended Mr. Pence’s decision to not immediately inform the White House of his vision on Wednesday, saying the vice president was unsure as to whether God would want President Trump to know of the impending rapture. “This was something that the Vice President intended to pray on,” Farah told reporters, adding that Pence had not anticipated the conversation would be leaked to the press.","Vice President Pence: God to End Human Suffering on July 10th, 2018",http://realnewsrightnow.com/2018/04/vice-president-pence-god-to-end-human-suffering-on-july-10th-2018/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","DA NANG, Vt. – President Donald J. Trump said he has taken Vladimir Putin at his word that the Russian president did not tape a sign reading ‘kick me’ on his back during a meet and greet with world leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this weekend, despite numerous statements and a plethora of photographic evidence proving otherwise.

‘He said he didn’t do it. He said he didn’t put the sign there. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as they flew from Da Nang to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Saturday. The president said he confronted Mr. Putin on three separate occasions during the summit, each time asking him about the ‘kick me’ sign. “Every time he sees me, he says, “I didn’t do that,” Trump said. “And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.”

The sign, which appeared to written in blue marker and constructed using a sheet of paper and scotch tape, hung prominently from President Trump’s blazer for most of the APEC summit and was clearly visible during the president’s thirty-minute address to Pacific Rim leaders. “It gave me quite a chuckle to see it dangling there while he was rambling on about trade abuses,” a member of China’s delegation to APEC told the Global Times. “Of course, no one wanted to be the first to kick him,” the official said, adding, “But everyone knew [Putin] put it there.”

Everyone, it seems, except Donald Trump. Citing discrepancies in statements made by Russian and American officials regarding the timing of the sign’s placement, the president remained steadfast in his belief that Putin couldn’t have been the culprit. “I mean give me a break, I can’t stand there and argue with him,” he said. “I’d rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you. I’d rather have him, you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about a sign.”

President Trump has become increasingly frustrated in recent weeks as his inability to make good on his campaign promise of fostering a friendly relationship with Russia becomes strikingly clear.

"['R.

“Russia has no interest in acquiring new territories outside the boundaries of Eurasia,” Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian president Vladimir Putin, announced during an unscheduled press conference with the international media on Friday. “There is absolutely no scenario in which the Russian Federation would benefit from an annexation of Puerto Rico – or any island in the Caribbean for that matter,” Peskov added.

Russian officials say senior members of President Donald J. Trump’s national security team reached out to them less than an hour after Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was taken into federal custody on Monday. Manafort, who faces a slew of charges including money laundering and conspiracy against the United States, is the first person to be charged in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

According to Mr. Putin’s spokesperson, the Kremlin immediately rejected the Trump administration’s initial request for more than 33,000 of Mrs. Clinton’s deleted emails in exchange for the hurricane-ravaged U.S. territory. “There was not even a moment’s hesitation,” Peskov told reporters, continuing, “An offer of this kind is no good for Russia; even a Chechen can see that.”

Nevertheless, the White House persisted. Official transcripts provided to The Guardian by Moscow show the Trump administration made two more attempts to seal the ill-fated deal with Russia. First, the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, took a go at diplomacy Wednesday morning by offering to invest “vast sums of money” in Russia’s tourism industry. Shortly after Kushner was rejected, President Trump contacted Putin directly and told him the United States would allow Russia to place intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Puerto Rico. “I promise you, we will look the other way,” Mr. Trump was quoted as saying.

Following Friday’s impromptu press conference at the Kremlin, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations filed a formal complaint against the United States and threatened to sever diplomatic ties unless the White House “ceases all efforts to dump its dirty laundry in Russia’s backyard.” Requests for comment by the White House Press Office were not returned.",Russia: 'No Interest' in Acquiring Puerto Rico Despite Pleas from Trump,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/11/russia-no-interest-acquiring-puerto-rico-despite-pleas-white-house/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE
"['R. Hobbus J.D.', 'Joe Stacy']","OTTAWA, On. – Nearly one percent of the U.S. population has voluntarily defected to Canada since President Donald J. Trump assumed office on January 20, according to a treasure trove of declassified Canadian intelligence documents made public on Thursday.

The documents, which were obtained by the Toronto Sun through Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, show how the Canadian Security Intelligence Service – often working in conjunction with the Canada Border Services Agency – used a number of enticing incentives including the promise of free healthcare to lure an estimated three million U.S. citizens across the border.

“Our orders came directly from the Office of the Prime Minister,” a senior Canadian intelligence official with firsthand knowledge of the operation told the Toronto Sun. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, described at least a dozen instances in which “high-profile” American defectors were offered a lifetime supply of maple syrup – a right afforded only to natural-born citizens – in exchange for information pertaining to U.S. economic and national security secrets.

When it comes to convincing their neighbors in the south to defect, Canadian intelligence officials have a wide range of options at their disposal. “When you get right down to it, Americans are a simple people,” Doug McKenzie, a former Canadian counterintelligence operative, told Real News Right Now. McKenzie, who serves as an adviser to the Security Intelligence Review Committee, said the vast majority of Americans who renounced their citizenship in the weeks and months following Mr. Trump’s inauguration were persuaded with offers as simple as a signed Wayne Gretzky jersey or the opportunity to take a selfie with Justin Trudeau.

However, selfies with the prime minister and unlimited jars of fresh maple syrup aren’t the only incentives motivating Americans to embrace a more progressive way of life across the border.

North Korea’s state-run news agency, KCNA, described Friday’s test as a “glorious victory,” saying the Hananim-ui Son, which translates to “Hand of God,” is capable of “vaporizing” the U.S.-led International Space Station in a single burst. South Korean intelligence officials say the laser weapon, which is believed to be housed near a military installation along the country’s mountainous border with China, poses a grave threat to stability in the region.

In a series of tweets fired off Saturday evening, U.S. President Donald J. Trump renewed a promise he’d made in early August, saying North Korea – which has since launched two ICBMs capable of striking Guam over Japan and has conducted its sixth nuclear test – will be met with “fire and fury” if it continues to make threats against the United States. “North Korea best quit while they’re ahead,” President Trump tweeted, later adding that his administration is exploring “many” military options.

North Korea’s latest display of increasingly advanced military might has left experts around the world in a state of disbelief. “No one knew they were capable of developing technology of this magnitude,” Nicolai Rehcenko, a former Russian cosmonaut and weapons developer, told Russia Today. Rehcenko, like countless others in the defense industry, said North Korea’s space weapons program is advancing significantly faster than anyone ever expected. “The fear now is that they will soon have the ability to target the moon,” Rehcenko said, adding that such a strike could trigger a mass extinction on earth.

Friday’s test of the Hananim-ui Son laser weapon, which NASA officials say was visible from space, comes as the United States struggles to formulate a viable response to North Korea’s previous weapons tests, including the recent below-ground detonation of a thermonuclear bomb. Speaking at Joint Base Andrews, an Air Force installation just outside of Washington, D.C., on Friday, President Donald Trump suggested a rapid military response to the North Korean threat could be in the works, saying, “We’ll see.”",North Korea Claims to Have Shot Down Asteroid with Laser Weapon,http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/09/north-korea-claims-to-have-shot-down-asteroid-with-laser-weapon/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE
"['R.

“The mood in Marawi right now is very somber,” reported Francis Perault of VICE News. Perault, who is embedded with the Philippines special forces as they battle the Islamic State, said many militants believe American transgender soldiers are the result of a genetically modified super soldier program initiated by former U.S. president Barack Obama.

“This idea that they somehow possess the strongest qualities of both sexes is simply incorrect,” said Major General Mitchell Landry, who oversaw the Pentagon’s super soldier program under Obama. Maj. Gen. Landry, who appeared on MSNBC Tuesday night to dispel claims that transgender Americans have been forcibly recruited into the program, said candidates are selected from group homes at a very young age. “These individuals have no concept of gender identity,” Landry charged, adding, “In any case, sex is completely irrelevant to their mission.”

Nonetheless, communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence and obtained by The Washington Post show the Islamic State believes transgender super soldiers are so deadly that even President Donald Trump doesn’t want anything to do with them. “These guys are absolutely terrified,” a senior U.S. intelligence official told The Post. “Much of what we’ve been able to intercept is stuff you’d expect to see in a science fiction movie.”

The Philippine military has been fighting to liberate Marawi City from Islamic extremists since early May when heavily armed ISIS militants stormed the city, killing more than twenty-one people. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Defense unveiled plans to provide air support in the form of targeted drone strikes. Hours later, ISIS commanders issued a warning to recruits saying they should expect to encounter American transgender soldiers who posses nearly twice the strength of a normal human being.",Report: Islamic State Fighters Terrified of Transgender 'Super Soldiers',http://realnewsrightnow.com/2017/08/report-islamic-state-fighters-terrified-of-facing-transgender-super-soldiers/,realnewsrightnow,International News,FALSE

It appears the virus can now change the appearance of infected people, so that they mutate into Donald Trump lookalikes. Not only do they become Donald Trump clones, they also possess the mannerisms and intelligence of Donald Trump.

“This is very disturbing,” lamented WHO scientist, Jerry Alarmed. “We have never seen anything like this in the history of virology. We are looking at something unprecedented. Just imagine if this spreads - the world's IQ will go down by 60 points or more.”

“I’m warning everyone to keep an eye on your I-phones, because these duplicates won’t hesitate to pick them up and start texting with them. Whatever you do, don’t mention the word 'golf' to them.”

As it turns out, the president of Brazil met with President Trump at the White House after he mutated from the virus, and from all aspects, the meeting went extremely well.

“The meeting between Balsonaro and I went extremely well,” stated Trump at a White House press conference. “He is such a handsome guy. He is a high-intelligence guy, really smart. His golf IQ was off the charts. I must admit, he is nearly as smart as I am. He is an expert on almost as many things that I am an expert on, and believe me, I’m an expert on everything. He told me not to worry about the coronavirus. He stated it is doing more good than bad. He hopes everyone gets the virus, because it will only help the world. I agree with him. Now that we don’t have to worry about COVID 21, or 20, or 25, or whatever it is, we can get back to having Wall Street go upward and away back into the bull market.”

Unfortunately for news organizations such as CNN, this hasn’t gone over well. As more people become infected with the virus, the more likely they will label CNN and comparable news sources as “fake news”.

Once again, as with the recent horrific Kincaid fire in Northern California, homes and other structures have been burned, putting people into their vehicles and onto the streets.

They join others who have been living in their vehicles for the past two years, again from faulty PG&E equipment causing fires.

Any casual observer traveling the highways notices wires strung up on slender wooden poles, some leaning, some pecked through by woodpeckers.

Poles are sometimes known to burst into flames from malfunctioning high power lines strung across them.

However, there is a readily-applied answer to all this.

The power in Northern California recently was shut down for five days on two occasions.

This handy dandy answer led on to conditions approaching chaos as landlines failed in remote areas where cell phones don’t work, supermarkets had to throw away tons of food, and gas stations assumed wait-lines of two hours.

However, an even more dramatic and efficacious solution is now being considered.

With a total shutdown of power throughout California, the problem of faulty equipment and deteriorated infrastructure is ameliorated.

Having much less to do under conditions of no power, Californians can turn in massive numbers to cleaning up the environment, especially in Northern California forests.

Some investment in tools, tents, barbecues, and sleeping bags can put millions in the state to work on the problem, particularly helpful to homeless people.

Further, with concentration on this matter of basic survival similar to past centuries of darkness, candle, and kerosene lantern, Californians will have little time left for politics.

Thus, any hint of “radical, Putin-favoring sentiments” and such madness as ""emissions reduction in vehicles"" will no longer be important.

Additionally, giving infrastructure workers weapons will allow them to hunt for their own evening meals, instead of relying on scrounging through garbage cans here and there.

Their neo-vintage computer adds one feature not present in older systems: it has a brain scanner designed to monitor the private thoughts of the user, and it applies electric shocks to the user if the thoughts are not politically correct.

According to computer enthusiast, Keith Jones, ""They forget that the transistor was invented by a known racist. So, anyone trying to silence those trying to bring advances to the world merely because they have a private belief is a hypocrite.

['Michael Sienicki'],"When Elon Musk announced his plans to create a time machine back in April of 2016, many in the scientific community were skeptical of the entrepreneur’s ability to take on such a formidable task. Despite the reservations, many in attendance at the press conference waited curiously as he took the stage to unveil his newest project:

“Hey Guys,” he addressed the crowd, “So, you remember when I shot a Tesla into space? Well, my buddies and I were talking, and we decided we’re gonna make, like, a really badass time machine; and then we’re gonna, like, send a Tesla back in time.”

While many celebrated Musk’s ambition to be the first to bend time and space, the project known as TimeXXX, was not without its criticisms. In the weeks following the press conference, many physicists and academics came forward condemning not the seemingly impossible task of creating a time machine, but rather the CEO’s decision to send one of his Tesla Cybertrucks into the unknown frontier of time. One such group, Physicists United Sharing Science for Youth, drafted an open letter to Mr. Musk, erging him to reconsider his decision:

“We, proud members of Physicists United Sharing Science for Youth, strongly discourage Elon Musk for his choice to send a Tesla Cybertruck back in time. If such a task as creating a time machine should succeed, we plead with Mr. Musk that he considers the incredible possibilities that could be presented as a result. As such, we here at P.U.S.S.Y. ask that instead of a Tesla Cybertruck, he elects to send Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to the year 1988; where he could convince an eight-year-old Macaulay Culkin to use his adorable boyish charm to influence global climate policy, and thus, save us from an almost assured destruction. If Mr. Musk searches his heart, we believe he will know it to be true. The only logical conclusion is to send Dwayne Johnson into the past.”

In a brief statement, Mr. Musk took to Twitter to respond to the group’s criticism:

“Kiss my nuts, chode-lickers. Get your own time machine.”

The years following his announcement were quiet and shroud with mystery, until August of 2018, when the world was given their first indication of progress from TimeXXX. In the early morning hours of August 16th, Los Angeles police responded to multiple calls reporting a man on horseback alerting local residents of an approaching enemy. When officers caught up with the equestrian, the man introduced himself as Paul Revere. One of the first responding officers recalled the event to a local newspaper:

“Well, when we arrived on scene, it took a considerable amount of convincing to get the man to dismount from his horse. He was clearly distressed, and very disoriented. Kept saying irrational things like the British were gonna get us, and that the colonists needed to rise up. Really strange shit. We just figured he was on dust. I mean, it’s Los Angeles, crazy stuff like that happens all the time. So after a brief pursuit on foot, we finally got him to the ground and tased him a few times, and that took the fight right out of him.”

When police got the man back to central booking, officers were shocked to be met by Elon Musk and his team from TimeXXX. They explained that the man they had in custody was, in fact, Paul Revere; and that he had escaped from their testing facility only hours earlier.

Reports immediately began circulating, with many calling the arrest an elaborate hoax devised by Musk to either garner interest for his time travel program, or to possibly warn local residents of the impending release of the horrific and widely panned 2019 film, Cats. All doubts were squashed, however, when Musk assured reporters that Revere was the first measure of success for the TimeXXX program, and even went so far as to let the American patriot himself make a statement to the press:

“I’ve not the slightest imagining of where I am. This is most strange, indeed; but please, someone must alert the colonists! Without my warning, they will most surely be vanquished!”

Reflecting the fascination that reporters and the public alike had with Musk’s incredible achievement, one man in the crowd could only find so many words to describe the event:

“Well that’s pretty cool.”

It wasn’t but a year and a half later, in February of 2020, that Elon Musk announced TimeXXX had finally achieved their goal of sending a Tesla Cybertruck into the past, specifically 28 AD. When asked why he chose that period of time, Mr. Musk responded:

“Cause we thought it’d be funny.”

And when asked how the public would know if he really sent a Cybertruck into the past, his answer was short and to the point:

“Oh, you’ll know.”

Sure enough, not a week after his announcement, Christians worldwide began reporting the appearance of strange passages in their bibles, such as the book of Matthew, where Jesus was referenced, “rolling up in a sweet-ass ride” to pick up the “dirty dozen squad.”

TimeXXX had proved the impossible possible, and celebrations around the world followed in the days since the confirmation. The discovery inspired many to hypothesize what other fantastic achievements could be pursued given this newfound technology. Though, where there are opportunities, there are also challenges, one of which no one could have predicted. In the days following Musk’s crowning accomplishment, he announced that he would be shutting the project down, effective immediately. Understandably, the outcry from the public was swift and unyielding. When asked why he would deprive the world of such an extraordinary tool, the entrepreneur told reporters that the project was, “starting to get gay,” and that it was, “not that funny anymore.”

In a saga that was rife with drama and contention, Elon Musk has proven against all odds, that time travel is no longer a distant dream, but rather a true scientific reality; so long as someone else can get it figured out. The world will look back on the success of TimeXXX as one of the most significant achievements mankind has ever accomplished. As for Elon Musk, the horizon is forever expanding, the limits of which are only created by our inability to look beyond ourselves. Mr. Musk continues to look beyond, and has since already declared his next project:

“I dunno, maybe I’ll, like, send a Tesla into the Mariana Trench or something.”

Godspeed, Mr. Musk.

The Sun is maintaining its distance from Earth, of more than 93million miles.

The news comes as a huge relief, after some in the British team had voiced the opinion that the Sun was spinning dangerously out of control, was getting nearer and nearer to the Earth each day that went by, and was gradually raising the planet's temperature, causing global warming, and potentializing climate and environmental catastrophe in the near future.

That may still happen, but it's nothing to do with the Sun.

It's been meticulously calculated that, if the Sun were only 2 meters closer to the Earth, the temperature would be unbearably hot; if it were 2 meters farther away, it would be cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.

Geoff Derp from the University of Dusseldorf has recently completed a study of every film that Hitler appeared in, to try to find out what species he was. ""It's very odd,"" said Derp. ""Hitler seems almost unhuman. And we believe that he had one tentacle.""

Derp points to a 1941 video of Hitler at a Nuremberg rally, where he attacks his former rival Von Hindenberg. ""Where are the telegraphs?"" he shrieked to a hysterical crowd. ""Lock him up!"" the crowd chanted back. Von Hindenberg had died in 1934, but Hitler locked up his bones anyway.

""In that video,"" said Derp, ""Hitler waves his right arm in the air, and it doesn't move like a human arm. It bends in peculiar ways, like a tentacle.""

Hitler's tentacles were a well-known fact during the 1940s. Winston Churchill believed that he was half-squid, and that he could be tempted by a sexy lady-octopus. Many paratroopers in tentacle drag were dropped over Berlin, although none of them were ever heard from again.

,"U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a friendly phone call with Mexico’s president on Friday but asserted he will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of the countries’ ties because Mexico has “beat us to a pulp” in the past. Mexico’s peso extended gains on news of the call. The two men spoke for about an hour on Friday, a day after President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped a planned meeting in Washington next week over Trump’s insistence that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar border wall. “It was a very, very friendly call,” Trump told a joint news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May.

Similarly, President Nieto conveyed a similar message in his interview with El Universal, the largest news agency in Mexico City. “I can tell you I am happy with what was said and what was agreed upon,” the president revealed. “I am convinced that we can have a friendly, respectful relationship with the United States as well as with President Trump.” Asked to elaborate on the topics mentioned during the hour-long telephone call, President Nieto said that he was not at liberty to disclose that, but did mention there was talk about the wall between the two countries, as well as a possible “deal” that might be struck in the future.

“I was very blunt and open with him, since I don’t believe him to be a man who cares much about pleasantries or protocol,” the Mexican president said. “I told him Mexico would agree to pay for the wall only under the condition that our country and the Mexican people be compensated for it in some other way. While we were talking, the though came to me that perhaps I could ask him to have his engineers design the wall so that it puts Texas in Mexican territory; in other words, to build the wall so that it excludes Texas from the United States. I though that would be fair, since we would be paying for the construction.”

He added, “I could tell he didn’t like the idea, but to be fair – he did say he would think about it. And if you think about it rationally, you’ll arrive at the conclusion that it’s a somewhat fair trade-off. Sure, on one hand our national budget would be nearly depleted, since the initial cost of construction is still only based on loose estimates. However, getting Texas back after all this time would be a huge victory for Mexico.”

“I have to add that I still haven’t figured out what we would do with the conservative, inbred rednecks that reside there at the moment, but I’m sure we’d be able to come to some sort of an arrangement. At the end of the day, we all know how huge a fan Donald Trump is of deporting people.

,"Los Angeles – The popular youtuber Logan Paul is in hot waters again, and had to issue another apology after a controversial unboxing video, The Hard Times reports.

Apparently, he opened up a casket in a local cemetery, in a video titled “UNBOXING IN GRAVEYARD (SAVAGE)”.

The video was removed by Youtube’s team around 2 hours after being uploaded, since it literally showed the Youtuber in Westwood Village Memorial Park in California, digging up a casket and opening it with his friends.

“Woah check out this killer swag,” said Paul, “So, we got a dude inside who looks like he hasn’t hit the gym in years. What’s up, bro? What’s with those skinny arms, bro?”

Paul removed the body from the casket, lifted it and shouted “Get it? DEAD-Lifting!”, while playing Despacito.

Two hours later, he issued an apology on Twitter:

“Let’s start with this. I’m sorry. Again. I never meant to offend anybody when I posted a video where I unbox a coffin, check out the cool collectibles inside, take out the corpse, and deadlift it. LOL! Sorry, just remembering that joke. Fuckin’ classic. Anyway, all I wanted to do was raise awareness about death, which is a very serious issue because if you are dead you can’t like and subscribe. #logang #maverick”

With the recent overdoses of high-caliber musicians, fans are concerned for Justin Bieber.

Is Justin Bieber on drugs? A new YouTube video of Justin Bieber “tweaking” — or so some fans say — have people worried for the singer.

At the beginning of one of the clips in question, Bieber waves at a little girl who seems to be a fan. Her parents encourage her to wave and say hello, while Bieber begins to move and shake erratically with his hands in his pockets before picking up the child for a hug. He also rubs the tiny girl’s back rigorously.

,"Richmond, Virginia – A mother was arrested yesterday after she left her four children aged between one and seven years old in her car for more than nine hours while she was eating alone in a restaurant.

According to the Richmond Police Department, 34-year-old Raquel Hernandez decided to leave her kids in the car while treating herself to an all-you-can-eat meal at the Golden Corral Buffet & Grill.

The 400-lbs woman arrived around 11 AM and was still eating when the police arrived on the site at 8:20 PM.

29-year-old Sarah Ferguson, the waitress who warned the police, says she noticed the kids in the car when she arrived for her shift and saw them again when she finished her work.

“I saw them in the car when I arrived around 11:30 in the morning, I thought their mother was gone for a quick visit at the nearby pharmacy or something. But when I finished my shift eight hours later, they were still there!”

Ms. Ferguson called the police, who immediately freed the children from the vehicle and went looking for the mother.

The young waitress says she was shocked to find out that the mother of the children was a customer she had served during her entire shift.

“She was there during the whole eight hours I worked. I must have picked up at least sixty empty plates from her table.”

The single mother of four will now face four charges of child abandonment and four charges of child neglect.

If found guilty on all charges, Ms. Hernandez could lose custody of her children and spend up to 20 years in prison.

,"A 117-year old man from Texas was liberated from prison this morning after outliving a 99-year sentence, becoming the first prisoner to do so in the history of the United States.

Grandson of one the most famous horse thief in American history, Henry William Borne was arrested by the Texas Rangers in 1919 for being part of in an important horse-stealing ring.

Borne, his father and seven other accomplices were accused of stealing over 7,000 horses and mules, including a lot of 1,735 horses destined to the American military effort in the first World War.

The eight others were sentenced to death and hanged in 1920, while Borne, who was underage when the crimes were committed, was sentenced to 99 years in prison.

Unexpectedly, the Amarillo native actually survived his sentence, which was spent in a total of 11 different detention centers.

He was liberated this morning from the Central Unit Prison, in Sugar Land, after spending almost an entire century behind bars.

Visibly emotional, Mr. Borne expressed his worries about adapting to life in the 21st Century.

“I saw a few cars once as a kid when I went to Dallas. I’ve been watching TV and I know they’re now everywhere, but I’ll have to get used to it.”

Despite his long incarceration, the 117-year old man also fears he could have difficulty adapting to a life without crime.

“All I’ve ever been outside prison is a horse thief. That’s the only thing I was good at. I bet I’d still be better than most of today’s horse thieves, even at my age.”

Despite his fears, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice considers there is a “very low risk” that he will resume his life of crime.

In fact, the number of horse theft has constantly dropped over the last century and the use of identification microchips over recent years has made such crimes much easier to solve.

Punishment for horse theft can still be severe, as one woman in Arkansas was sentenced to 60 years in prison for the 2011 theft of five horses.",Man Freed After Outliving 99-Year Prison Sentence For Horse Theft,https://www.huzlers.com/man-freed-after-outliving-99-year-prison-sentence-for-horse-theft/,huzlers,Entertainment,FALSE

,"Seven employees of a nursing home for elderly people were arrested by the FBI this morning in Charlottesville, Virginia, for forcing the elders under their care to fight each other.

According to investigators, the 124 residents of the Retirement Village were forced to fight each other in order to obtain basic things such as food and medical treatments.

The fights were filmed and relayed online on a specialized website, where they often attracted several thousand viewers and astounding amounts of money in bets.

FBI spokesman, Bill Donovan, says the most popular fights were the ones in which contenders were “armed” with canes or walkers.

“The older and more handicapped the fighters were, the larger was the crowd the fight attracted. Some were so weak they used mobility scooters to try and roll on each other.”

Officer Donovan says the staff used several different methods to force the residents to fight, either by through rewards or punishment.

“The nursing home’s staff forced the elders to beat each other up very badly, offering ridiculous rewards such as Jell-O or extra mashed potatoes. Some residents who refused to fight had their dentures or glasses confiscated until they complied.”

According to the FBI, the organizers of this illegal combat ring may have pocketed over $125 million over the 3 years it was in operation, mostly from online bets.

The FBI confirmed it has seized a lot of computer hardware in the Retirement Village as well as several other pieces of evidence like video cameras blood-covered walkers.

The two owners of the retirement home and five other employees were arrested for the role they played in the organization.

The five employees each face numerous criminal charges and could face sentences going from 45 to 85 years in jail if found guilty on all charges.

The owners of the retirement home, Terence and Michelle Aniston, respectively face 37 and 31 accusations and could face over 300 years in prison.

Their trial is expected to begin at the end of June and should draw a lot of media attention.
